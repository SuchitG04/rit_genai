"Fantastic spot for an even or a quite cocktail.  They were swell to host the Yelp crew with a great drink menu and super attentive staff.I'd certainly recommend anything with the purred fruit in it (apple, any of them really)!

"Love, love, love the calamari. It's so good and spicy. There is an endless list of martinis and one is better than the next. There is a first and second floor, if you prefer more of a bar or lounge atmosphere. It's not a place I like for dinner, but for drinks and apps it's wonderful.

"Love this place. Stiff martinis and cocktails, cheap drinks, good service, nice atmosphere to chill in the upstairs lounge and hang up with your friends. Classy crowd and much more mature, older, and professional crowd. There aren't any of those college frat boys or belligerent drunks there, which is so great. Very nice place to wind down after a long day.

"It's everything a great cocktail bar should be.  Great location, ambiance, cocktails and chill environment.**Disclaimer:   5 stars doesn't have to mean it's New York City good. It is a simple place and it's not flashy by any means.   I'd take a girl for the beginning of a date or on the opposite end of the spectrum, talking business with colleagues.

"I came here before a pirates game, so it was around 5:30ish or so in the evening, we had just gotten lucky that they had a table open before all there reservations for the night started to come in.  I ordered the chicken jerk sandwich with a side salad, absolutely loved it!  The chicken had the perfect amount of spice to it which was off set with sweet with the pineapple chutney it had on it, sooo good!  The salad was even great because they used real green spring mix instead of iceburg lettuce.  I also loved that they put feta cheese on top, its one of my favorite cheeses for salad topping!  Service was great here and even though I didn't have a drink here that night I have a previous time and they are yummy!  Love this place and can't wait for my next visit!

"Olive or Twist is the historic site of my VERY FIRST MARTINI when I turned 21, many years ago.  It's been a long, happy union.While Olive or Twist is NOT a five star restaurant, it gets 5 stars from me because I love it.  Its one of the few places I know of that has been CONSISTANTLY good.  for years!  The interior is warm and a little bit industrial.  The downstairs is the same as it has always been and it's still very nice.The drinks are great although the first martini I ever had (a girl doesn't forget!  [well,this one didn't]) was a Pineapple Upside Down martini and I don't think they offer that anymore but they do have a very expansive martini menu.  I tried the chipotle martini and it was so excellent that when I took my first sip I sighed in a way my bf turned to me and sarcastically said, ""Oh, you're going to be Yelping about that, aren't you""  Then, I refused to let him even try it bc it was that good.  It was MINE.I also had a cake batter martini which tasted great and came out looking so pretty I instagrammed a picture of it and immediately all my friends clicked like on it, and my one aunt commented I should drink less.  Whatever. She needs a martini.The service was great.  Our waitress, Lauren, was really cool and very good at recommending the drinks--the chipotle martini was her recommendation, I would never had ordered that on my own.We had the buffalo chicken dip which was served in a martini glass and it was really good.My favorite thing on the menu there is the tomato basil bisque soup and it has been rocking my lunch hour for the past ten years.  It's delicious.  Its so good that Lauren and I actually high fived when she brought it out.  (true story.)My bf had the chicken caprese wrap and said it was excellent, it was gone within minutes so that is a good sign.I highly recommend this place for lunch, after dinner cocktails, or a date.  This is one of my favorite downtown lunch spots!

"A beautiful little bar with an exciting ""martini"" list - do step outside your comfort zone and try one of the crafted drinks.

"The location is in a strip mall, but this place is a diamond in the rough.  The food was some of the best italian food I have had anywhere.  I live in Kansas City, which has a pretty large and long standing italian populaiton.  The food is a good as any of the old italian places in KC.  Everyone in my group was amazed at the quality of the food for the price.  I will keep this one on my list of places to come back to when I am in AZ again.

"THIS PLACE IS OPEN!The best food and the best service. Try the butter nut squash ravioli.  Fantastic

"We can't say enough good things about this place. The owner and wait staff were genuinely friendly and the food was great. I had the veal caprese and my wife had the canolone.  Both were exceptional and reasonably priced.  Unlike the chain Italian restaurants, the portions were reasonable instead of super-sized.  We were full but not stuffed when we finished.  We also brought our fourteen month old along.  They don't have a kids menu, so I can't call the restaurant ""family friendly,"" but everyone was really friendly to our family. The owner even stopped by once or twice to pinch our son's cheeks.  We live near by and are considering becoming regulars here.

"My husband and I want to give six stars!!!!  We've driven by this place for a year, and always talked about going in....SO sorry we waited so long!!!  Very pretty little place.  The service was great and very warm.  I had the butternut squash ravioli and in was in heaven for every single bite!!!  We will be back often and plan to take my daughter next time.  I don't think they have a kid's menu, but our server said they could do spaghetti and meatballs or fettucine with chicken.  Perfect.  Thank you Jennifer!!!  We loved it!!!  =)

"I'm still laughing reading poor Maribeth's review below; I think maybe her ex DID pay someone to play an awful joke on her.  Like drugging her and taking her to Wendy's and telling her she was at Salute.  This place is the best little neighborhood secret ever and I only hope everyone reads and believes Maribeth's review so I can still get a table on Friday nights without making a reservation.

"My husband and I have been here several times, both for large functions and on our own.  What we always notice is how attentive the wait staff is.  And they really seem to care about our dining experience.  Of the appetizers, we love the antipasto, stuff mushrooms and seafood salad.  The butternut squash ravioli is awesome, as is everything we've tried.  The strip mall location isn't particularly appealing, but the good food and excellent service will keep us coming back.

"Very, very good. Top notch calamari and scampi appetizers. Excellent garlic bread.Entrees were eggplant parm- great; lasagna- excellent; orange roughy with capers and artichokes-amazing and cheese tortellini with 4 cheese sauce- also great.Perfect service- a really on the ball waiter. Close to Hilton Tapatio  Cliffs too.Cozy place, nicely lit made you forget about the strip mall locale.

"Saturday night at Salutes is a real treat.  The live jazz duo sings quietly and adds to the ambience of this local gem.  The staff is always friendly and makes some reference to your last trip which makes you feel special.  And speaking of special...their chicken florentine special was mouth-watering.  I'm sure the bottle of Chianti helped...but just LOVED the experience.
",1
"Went with family last night...loved it! Our server, Julie, was excellent- extremely friendly and attentive to our table. The stuffed mushroom and shrimp scampi appetizers were delicious...excellent for dipping the really good garlic bread in the sauces. :) My daughter said that the fettuccine alfredo (not on the menu, but offered) was the best she's ever tasted. The butternut squash ravioli was very rich (almost too rich) but quite tasty. The guys both got the crab and shrimp stuffed ravioli with walnut cream sauce (not on the regular menu)- both loved it!  It's a really great place for a special date or a quaint dinner with friends.
",1
"I've been waiting to change from four stars to five and tonights dining experience did it.  The staff always makes us feel like one of their family and tonight was no different.  My eggplant parmesan was mouth-watering accompanied with their house Chianti.  Friday night live jazz always a pleasure.  Thanks, Julie, for noticing my hair...yours was adorable as well!  BTW...the place was packed...you may need a reservation!

"WARD is the best bartender. I hope that when I grow up one day I can be JUST like him. When he tells stories, they're so amazing, you'll want to hear them twice ;)

"Love this bar! GREAT affordable food! Awesome gambling promotions! Free Slot Tournament on Sat night at 7! Bartenders are the best!

"Irene's was my favorite spot to drink whilst on vacation. We ordered a pizza and I don't remember what my bf ordered, a burger, I think Our pizza was really good. I think it had jalepenos and sausage. And maybe extra cheese It was like $7. Had two drinks while we sat and enjoyed the company. The bartender was so sweet and friendly. They have a daily contest where you can win cash money if you come a few days a month and gamble there. It wouldn't work if you don't live there so I tuned out on the details. I don't know why we even bother with the strip. Get off the strip, people. See the real Vegas. Leftovers were yummy the next morning, cold or warmed. It's a dive but a good one.
",1
"When I lived in Vegas I was right behind the place. I was coming home from a mid week bender in the strip. Didn't feel like going home and I was all jacked up on vodkared bull and hungry. I stopped in here cuz I hadn't checked it out. Met someone right away from the Chicago burbs. Bartender was a cool guy. Had a pizza and I'm from Chicago so I'm a pizza snob. I was kinda drunk but that fawker tasted great. Had a beer or two then stumbled home and passed out.

"I take clients to clubs for lunch when I am in Charlotte on business. I travel all over and was not expecting much in Charlotte. I had gone to one uptown club a few times and it was nice.  I went to a Friday lunch special at The Men's Club from a hotel referral. It is remarkably nice inside, good staff, good music and a better menu than the hotel I was staying in. It was something I would have expected in Las Vegas, not Charlotte. I will go back every time I am in town.
",1
"This is by far the best strip club in Charlotte. I come here on Wednesdays for the lunch buffet during the day which is always a steal for 10$ all you can eat plus admission into the club. Otherwise I usually come on Friday or Saturday night when its packed with girls. The seating is comfortable and 1 large stage and three mini side stages. Girls are friendly and most are above a 7. Dances are 20$ and worth every penny. My favorite there is Bianca who is amazing in VIP.
",1
"Love the place, very friendly staff and definitely the hottest girls in town. Nonpushy girls which is a big plus. Very classy and clean, definitely not your typical strip club. The food is very good and reasonably priced. Check it out, you won't be sorry!!
",1
"Not only does this club have gorgeous entertainers, on point service from bartenders and waitresses, and an upscale environment, but the food is absolutely AMAZING!  They just added a ton of new items to their menu.  I highly recommended the Bison Cheddar Meatloaf and the Bone in Pork Chop topped with crawfish.  They have some great specialty cocktails with catchy names like the Wet Panty and Carmel Apple Tittay.This is not your typical strip club.  Everyone here is very polite (you won't get hounded for a dance the second you sit down).  The environment is very nice, classy, and CLEAN.  Their VIP area upstairs is top notch and always a great time.  Make sure to check out the bar at the top of the stairs, which IS open to the public.  The view from upstairs is awesome because you can see the whole club.Their breakfast buffet is also a great end to a Friday or Saturday night, so check it out 2am to 3:30am on those days.

"Great food and atmosphere.  Very upscale and friendly.  Favorite is the kick-ass filet for dinner.  Great lunch specials too.

"This is by far the nicest place in Charlotte to go as far as a men's club. They have a nice breakfast which is actually pretty good after 2 a.m. The girls for the majority are good looking. The ambiance is very nice and the complimentary valet is nice! I def recommend this place.

"Brought a group of my good friends over for a bachelorette party and we had an amazing time! The bartender Leah was on point all night and kept us having an amazing time! Will DEFINATELY be bak a lot more! Thank you!DJ EVO

"INDOOR SMOKING (when I'm looking for it) IS TOTALLY AWESOME!We came in here one night after an already long night of drinking.  The place was quiet, but the bar was incredibly well stocked, they allowed indoor smoking, and sold a range of cigars.  What's not to love, rightWe closed the place down... at some point, we ordered a delivery pizza.  The bartender was a ton of fun, told great stories, fed the jukebox with great songs (and let us pick about half of them) and really kept us going.  The prices were really reasonable on drinks, and we all had (too much of) a good time.  Several TVs had football on (without sound) and the bathroom was extremely clean.  Really, what more do you need in a barIf I had to critique one thing, though, it would be the cigar brands.  I think I only noticed one or two, but none of them were names I recognized.
",1
"Oooooo....under new management! Humidors are fully stocked, drinks are delicious, and there is regular music. The new owners are wonderfully gracious hosts, and each time I go I meet a new friend. Best newold Fitchburg hangout!

"They hired a new bartender. It was his first night on Sat. If I remember correctly I think his name is David. Gosh, I'm probably totally wrong though.Anyway, he's tended at a couple different places. He made 1 damn good Jamaican 10 Speed. I dislike Malibu so I asked for Parrot Bay. Delicious. I hope he sticks around for a while.There was a late last call on Sat too. They were still serving right up till 2. They pretty much called last call at 1:50. So I think we got out of there around 2:15.Oh, & I finally spotted the juke box. I've walked right past it quite a few times. I think when I look around for the juke box I picture the ones from the 50-70's or so. I'm looking for big, tall, brightly lit, & maybe orange or yellow colored. I'm so spastic sometimes lolRestroom light was on again too :)Come any day of the week. It's always fun here.

"Very cool divey casinobar with some of the friendliest people in vegas working there.  Been coming here for years and I never get tired of it.  You get mardi gras beads as you walk in and immediately after someone is there to get you a drink.  A couple of minutes later you are gaming, drinking and having a great time, and occasionally you really do win money and I mean real money, no tickets here so don't put a hundred in and then try to cash out, you'll be so loaded down with nickels and quarters you won't be able to walk.The drinks are strong, the slots are decently loose and the manager Barbara and the cashier Mary Ellen are so cool, make you feel so welcome.  The Russian cocktail waitress is really nice too and trust me, she'll be back to check on your drink before you can sip down the one you have.This is one thing I miss about Vegas, the free drinks to keep you there.  Most places don't give them away unless you're at a $1 machine and even then not usually.  So, La Bayou has my business two times a year, every year.  Keep up the good work everyone at La Bayou!

"ELVIS!!! well the slot machines. i love this place. their machines pay out coins. you can put coins in them as well. i love the sound of cashing out and hearing the coins. they have raffles every half hour.i always have a great time here.
",1
"I'm giving this place 5 stars because I've got a long story behind it.  To make it short, the yard long frozen drinks with the extra shot for a dollar caused me to get married on the fly. And actually the second one I had a WELL-POURED extra shot of Bacardi 151, almost filled up the entire bowl in the bottom of the yard long!!  The county almost wouldn't give us a marriage license!!  But that was nearly 7 years ago, and eveyrthing has worked out really well.  I do remember the place being very fun and crazy for a ""shotgun"" dive casino.  We'll go back next time we're in Vegas, not only for the memories, but alos because it was just plain fun here.
",1
"We absolutely love this place! This has become our ""meetup"" spot downtown. It's a fun little dive. They give out beads and have raffles. They sell cool beads in the back and make awesome HUGE drinks in yards and footballs. They also have some old slots that you can't find very often, and the slots are fairly loose. We always win a bit of cash there. A small downside is that the slots are old school without tickets. They drop a ton of nickels if you win. It's minor though and actually kind of fun.It's not fancy, it's just fun! Go!!!
",1
"I love this place. The machines are fun and the coin aspect is a nice perk. The cocktail server is AWESOME! They are super quick and attentive! I always tip them well. You should too! You won't regret it!

"Most fun on Fremont! I've had the best luck with pay out at these machines, the wait staff is usually great and you never have an empty or even near empty drink! The frozen drinks are fantastic and usually whoever is working back there knows their mixes and always creates something you'll enjoy! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!

"FANTASTIC. Does not pretend to be anything more than what it is. The back bar is where its at, huge strong drink for 16 dollars, with a shot of ever clear for an extra 3. Worked like a charm. And they pay in coins! Brilliant

"We came to town on Valentine's Day to celebrate my youngest son's 21st b-day (yes, it's on V-Day).  Sadly, the drive from L.A. was more hellish than usual and we got to our condo so late that we skipped out on driving to Fremont.  (however, we did find Ellis Island nearby and enjoyed that for what it is! see my review)I really wanted to make sure my sons went down to Fremont where I knew we'd end up in Bayou so we came Sunday after breakfast (Omelette House- divine!) .  I've been here before (of course, back in 2001 I think the daiquiris were about 13 the price!).  I really don't enjoy gambling, but I do like to sit at a REAL coin-op slot machine and pull the arm of the one-armed bandit with my own hand.  There is something very satisfying about plunking coins in and hearing your winnings clink into the tray.  A classic Vegas experience that is hard to come-by today. I truly hope they NEVER get rid of those machines!  It's a friendly place and a must-visit stop on Fremont.  We had a blast and were only sorry that we couldn't come at night and get they whole ""Experience!""   We will be back!*note to self:  The drinks are stronger than they look.  We got the hurricane, white Russian, and mud slide flavors and enjoyed them all.  I think I liked my son's white Russian best because it tasted like vanilla ice cream.  YUM!

"It's still as divey as ever here at La Bayou Casino.  It's run down, cramped and there's dusty stuff all over the walls and ceilings.  God knows I love this place!  It's one of the coolest places in downtown Vegas and they always get my business.From the time you walk in the door and get your beads and raffle ticket till the time you leave, it's non-stop free drinks, cool employees and loose slots.You know how most casinos only offer you free drinks when you are playing the $1 slots or better.  Not here!  I walked up, got some Mardi Gras beads and before I could sit down they asked me what I wanted to drink.  I hadn't gotten half way done and she are offering me another drink.  These ladies usually come by about once every 10 minutes so drink fast and get your moneys worth.  By the way, these aren't pussy drinks either - you can taste the alcohol.Their slot machines are usually pretty loose (not this time but usually).  The machines are retro coin payers so don't be looking for slots with tie ins to the latest movies or TV shows and be sure to have a cup or two handy for your big win.Like I said before, I'm still loving Barbara (manager) and Mary Ellen (cashier).  They are part of the experience and if they ever leave, the place just won't be the same.Man I want to go back there right now.

"If you are in Vegas, YOU MUST COME HERE!!!!This was one of the highlights of my recent trip to Vegas. La Bayou offers REAL nickel slots, frozen daiquiris, FREE drinks (if you are gambling, but it's nickel slots), and a dive-bar atmosphere. Upon arriving you are greeted by two ladies dresses in traditional vegas show girl feathers who hand out beads to customers. The beads really add to the kitsch environment of Fremont Street and La Bayou. You are also handed a lottery ticket to enter to win up to $10,000, which was another source of free entertainment. The machines themselves work very well and it was so much fun playing actual coins and seeing them clink into the coin return tray. The waitresses were very attentive and friendly( Remember to TIP). I never had to worry about asking for another drink and the drinks were STRONG. La Bayou is a great time for the non-serious gambler who wants to enjoy their time in Vegas with cheesy promotions, strong drinks and a taste of whats left of old school Vegas. It's just a good time all around!

"Not bad food, but this place isn't really a ""restaurant"" as much as it is one of the best drinking holes in Las Vegas, with a slick interior done up with tasteful neon and big televisions, a square bar, and one of the sexiest staffs in town. Food is pretty good too, but excessive drinking may give a slanted opinion on that one.
",1
"I really expected this place to be a disgusting, grimy, dive. I was shocked to discover a clean, comfortable, and beautifully decorated bar and restaurant. We ordered the gyro sliders, feta fries, and artichoke dip; all were delicious! Beers were only $4, which is an amazing deal in this town! We signed up for the Ladies' Club and saved 25% on our bill. This place could easily become my new favorite bar.

"We were looking for a place to watch the Superbowl in Vegas and lucked into this gem. There was no cover charge and we had the best seat in the house. Service was excellent. Our waitress was Brittany and she was so on top of it. The food is very good too. Had the pizza and wing special, tasty and very inexpensive. Also had buckets of beer. Would definitely come again.
",1
"Love this place!  If you are looking for a good bar, pretty ladies and great food.  You have found it.  We reserved a couch for the SB this year and the service was over the top.  My drink was never dry and the food was perfect. The servers were delightful, engaging and wore revealing but not too revealing outfits.I know it may look sketchy from the outside, but highly recommended.

"When you come to Vegas and you want REALLY, REALLY expensive vodka you will end up here unless you were completely mis-informed. If you really want to impress the vodka-lover you brought along then you better come here. Also, its in the Mandalay Hotel and Casino which is one of the better places to rest your feet in Las Vegas.

"One word: Chernobyl .  Start your night with this cocktail.  Whether you have to beg, borrow or video poker your way to the bargain $12 that this thing costs...DO IT.  If you like vodka (in my case LOVE vodka), or even if you don't, this is the cocktail to end all cocktails. It's got something close to 5 shots in it plus a float of stoli elite (5 different kinds of vodka).  But it gets better...the drink doesn't taste like vodka.  It tastes like a delectable cranberrylimefizzy thing that won't give you so much as a buzz.  It comes with a mutant-looking candie cinnimon stick that's a great touch.  Well worth it.  It's a vegas must-have.  Other than the drink, the bar is nifty- great decor (former USSR, the out-front statues head inside the frezzer, and bartops of ice).  Food is great but EXPENSIVE. The other drinks are great too...and I think they're fairly priced for the selection of vodkas, strength of drink and originality.
",1
"My friends and I had a real good time here. If you like expensive vodka, then this is your place. But to attain the ultimate experience is to purchase a bottle of vodka and drink it in the vodka freezer.  You get to put on Russain types of winter coats and drink off of a bar made of ice. Dean Cain and the guy that owns the Ivanko barbellcompany have a vodka locker there.  The manager of the place is so cool that in addition to the bottle that my friends and I had, he also let us taste other vodkas that they had available.   I was in pure vodka heaven.

"Vodka is definitely the star here! Every martini I have tried here is fabulous!  We went once when it wasn't particularly crowded at the ice bar and our bartender put on a great show of serving our martinis even though we had all ordered something different.

And I'm OK with that.Don't bother coming here to dine (honestly, I don't know why they even bother), but do come to swill.  Lots and lots of tasty boozy concoctions (it certainly helps that I looooove vodka) to enjoy.  And an ICE bar.  Imagine a drunken striptease on that  Super sexy one moment, catastrophic the next.

"Mandana K, Dave H and myself wandered around Mandalay looking for any bar to be open at 3:30 in the afternoon.  We stumbled upon a statute of a beheaded Lenin, signaling the entrance to the Red Square, which didn't open until 4 PM.  Once 4 arrived, we were the first to walk into the bar that day, taking seats at the bar, which is made out of ice.  Since this is a Russian-themed bar, they stock a wide assortment of vodkas.  On their menu, they had pages and pages of specialty vodka drinks.  We decided to each order different drinks so that we could sample each others.  Since there were only a few other patrons, we learned about the history of the place.  When the bar first opened, the bar generated a lot of controversy with the Russian community because of the statute of Lenin -- head attached -- and the perceived romantacizing of Communism.  The bar caved -- or maybe it was really a great publicity ploy -- and decided to behead Lenin in a public ceremony.  The head now resides inside a block of ice in the vodka locker, a walk-in, sub-zero freezer that stores premium vodka for their clients; it's so cold that before you enter, you need to don a thick, russian like fur coat and hat.  We toured the locker, knocked back a shot of vodka, and read the names of those who rented shelf space inside the locker.  For several thousand dollars a year, one can rent a space, store any vodka you please, have a name plate, and enter the locker any time you please.  Not a bad deal if split among the three of usWe continued to order drinks off the menu until we knocked back every single drink on the menu.  We looked around.  Just as we entered the bar as their first patrons, we exited as their last.  It was 4 AM.

"MMMM From Russia with Love-The Ice bar is beautiful and the friendly and knowledgeable waitstaff will help you negotiate through the endless varieties of .... uh  .... wait..... oh yeah... vodka.  I recommend getting some flights and splitting them with friends. Vodka has as many genres as wine and each is a brilliant ice cold experience.   Gotta love those Ruskies!I also have to admit that they have a beautiful logo and the T-shirt is top notch.

"A honest to gawd Vodka bar with an bar made of ice and Lenin's head in the top shelf  How can this place be less than 6 stars!I love going to Vegas, if nothing than getting blind drunk on potato booze.  The place is always packed and the staff is fast, and drinks are the stuff legendary nights start with a liberal dose of.  I would not live in Vegas, simply because of this place.  I'd never...ever...leave.

"Mmm, tasty. Easily some of the best mixed drinks that I've ever had the pleasure of downing.I started off with a chocolate martini from the dessert menu, since their kitchen was closed and I still needed something sweet to finish off dinner. It was smooth without being overly cloying or creamy. Very drinkable and deliciously chocolatey. They even floated a white chocolate red square in the drink. Nice touch. I'm a lightweight, so that one martini was enough for me, but I did get to try some of my friends' drinks. The Chernobyl will knock you on your butt if you aren't careful, but it tastes like a yummy, barely alcoholic, fruit drink. You won't know what hit you until it's too late. They also have an outstanding black cherry vodkapinot noir martini that is really unique. I can't remember the name of it, but it's worth scouring the menu for. The decor is elegant but cheesy, and the booths are the best spot to sit and people watch. We were there from about 1:30am-2:30am on a Friday night and it was easy to grab some good seats and it was easy to chat without having to shout.

"I love this swanky joint..  If you are a vodka connoisseur andor like to try new or rare vodkas you will be in heaven.  Its a vodka bar in Mandalay Bay with so many brands and styles of vodka to choose from your head will be spinning.  I'm a Gibson fan (vodka martini w onion) so I asked the bartender what brand he recommended for a his favorite vodka martini served up..  I was introduced to Zyr (still not available in California) and this has since been my favorite brand.. Its filtered 9 times and distilled 5 times and it is smooth as water.  You can find distributors selling this on the internet - I've been getting it shipped to my house ever since my last Vegas trip..  :)  I'm heading out there again this weekend and will definitely make a stop into this place.  Food and apps are tasty, nice presentation, pricey (then again everything in vegas is a bit pricey)..decor is very cool with an overwhelming ""red"" theme and the top of the bar is actually made out of 1 huge ice block.  So if you set a drink on it it'll frost up and stay cold.  They have quite an extensive original martini list, most of them fruity.  They allow you to head back into the walk-in freezer with a fur coat if you are into that.  Overall great spot!  Love hitting this place up in the early evening..

"I know Playboy Club has it's own reviews. Moon I also went to for a play date. Coming upstairs to walk into the medley of lights and fiber optics was simply amazing. It was more of an upscale version of Rain. It has a beautiful view of the Vegas Skyline. What got to me was the floors being lit up. The tables are metal with a mirrored finish. It kinda made me feel like a pervert watching girls dance on it...BUT WHO CARES! The dance floor is huge and the patio area is just amazing. Moon's roof has a huge video screen kinda like the Fremont St Experience but this roof is supposed to retract. That night it didn't due to the slight sprinkling. Moon also has a second floor with another bar and another patio access. I had a great time there. But this is one of those places you probably want to get a table for. Music was great - laser and light show was pretty off the hook. Sound system very LOUD. What more can you expect from a monster club

"This is a bonifide Vegas club!  Moon is located at the top of one of the Palms towers so the views are spectacular from the balcony to the restroom.  Yes, there's a floor-to-ceiling glass in the men's room.  And a urinal right next to it that makes it the one of the most breathtaking p!$$ spots in the world.  The club is also connected to the high-roller Playboy casino lounge where you can celebrity hunt.  The drinks are as stiff as the prices so bring lots of cash and drink heavily before you arrive.  The security staff was very courteous and helpful.Just be sure you arrive early, as in right after dinner, otherwise, you'll be spending a lot of time in line downstairs and you might not get in at all.  Once you're in, you're in.  Vegas Style, Baby!

"Fabulous club.I loved my night at Moon.We did bottle serviceVIP here and it was well worth the cost.  Well, okay - so we did bottle service for the boys, and for the girls - we got ourselves in but it took all of 15 seconds.   The management, bouncers and serversbusboys were all FABULOUS.  EXCELLENT service all around, I'd give it 10 stars if i could.   Every single person working at Moon that I had to deal with or talk to on this night was nothing short of stellar, and the treatment they gave us was  first-class all around.  The way they had us enter was straight through the Playboy Lounge, and what I saw of that place, I was not impressed.  Head up the escalators to Moon and then voila - - - your night begins and all of Moon is conducive to having a good time.  We ended up getting a table in a separate VIP lounge area, a good distance away from the dancefloor which made it possible to talk as well as drink in private.  There are booths everywhere - and all of  them were nicely set up and comfortable, well-placed, etc.  But I never like sitting too close to the dancefloor where people are falling into your table, or you can't even hear yourself think, so this was perfect.  When you opt for bottle service at Moon, the service leaves you wanting for nothing, nothing at all!  To make a reservation, there is a form to fill out and you do have to hold with your CC unless they know you.  It was relatively easy, and even those in our party who were late got in without a glitch just by mentioning the name under which I'd made reservations.  Very smooth process.Great music, great crowd, and a gorgeous club, to boot.  The patio area outside was fabulous - - view of the whole city, and lots of perfect photo opps out there.  Take a drink outside and get your groove going, come inside and dance the night away.  I would not have minded having a table outside reserved, and might do that the next time I am in Vegas.Three bottles later - - we were all nicely toasted, and I think everyone could agree that it was a great time.  FYI:  Don't pass out.  If you pass out cold in a drunken stupor - they will ask that you be escorted out.  One of my friends had just this happen to him, and when I came back from dancing - - he was gone.  Hahahaha....I'd go back to Moon at any time without any hesitation.  GREAT club, and perhaps one of the best in Vegas at this time.  GO GO GO!!

"Awesome club.  Loved it absolutely loved it.  Maybe it was the fact that the bachelorette party I was in tacked on to a really cute set of bachelors at a bachelor party there and had a bottle service and therefore a table and therefore a place to sit but this club was great.  Fabulous music and a great dance floor.  The gogo dancers were awesome (not like some places where you look at the gogo dancer go and you cannot help but think to yourself .. hey I could do a better job)  and the bar tenders were seriously on top of there stuff.  Fabulous.  Great people at this place and girls... the best thing.. the line at the bathroom moved quickly and there was practically no wait.  fantastic.  Oh and another thing for all of you out there.  I totally danced to my hearts content and talked to fantastically cute boys.  (for those who might be getting worried that I was never going to find a date.. yet.. Vegas might not count but still.. I had a great time)...  The Grey goose apple martini was to die for and figi water was what you could buy at the bar.  Check it out for sure if you can.

"This club was great, so great in fact that I danced so much I thought my feet were going to have to be amputated. The music was fantastic. We were put on some kind of list and immediately sent to the front of the line to be escorted right in. Not sure how that happened but given the line we by-passed, thank you. Plus someone gave us a drink while we waited for the elevator, thank you.

"It's places like these that makes me proud to be from here.  On a visit to my hometown, I stepped into this place via my peoples people.  They had nice bouncers, wonderful bartenders, fucking the best music I've ever heard at a clubraveloungestore ever, and laxed security.  They even let the girls rotate and go up and dance next to their residential dancers.  Their residential dancers were also better than those at other clubs like PURE.  This venue is definitely smaller than Rain and lacks the pyrotechnic capabilities, but it has a great view of the strip.  Once you get in, you can also visit the Playboy Lounge.  It is a great visit as well.  As always, make sure you are looking fierce to go.  =)  I will definitely come back the next time I'm in town... Sept  If you have no hookups, just get there early... 10:30 when they open.

"Went on a Sunday night a few weeks ago and thought it was great! Great mix of hip-hop, top 40, rock n roll etc. Impressive sound system on the outdoor deck. Spacious dancefloor that opens up to the night sky. Great views. Not sure how it would be to reserve a table, but the booths seem like they could hold up to 10 or more guests.
",1
"I'm not really a big club guy, maybe it's because I'm not a player (or is it playa  I can never keep track of what the kids say these days)  I hate lines, I hate cover charges, and I hate $12 drinks that should be $6. On this night I didn't have to worry about these things thanks to a friend of a friend of a friend who got us in without waiting and without a cover (we were more than happy to give him a nice tip though)  So we walk past the line and I'm feeling like Wayne and Garth holding up their backstage passes in Wayne's World.We get up to Moon and I'm thinking ""Maybe I should change my whole anti-club attitude!"" This place was great - awesome music, some outdoor space with amazing views of Vegas and one floor down, the Playboy Club - a casino that features Playboy bunnies as dealers.  Did I mention that I'm also not much of a gambler  I'm thinking that might be changing as well...
",1
"Moon is one of my favorite Vegas Clubs.  The vibe and people are great, the views from upstairs on the deck is spectacular, and you've gotta love a place with a retractable roof over the dance floor.  Have not done bottle service, but really no need; very easy to navigate even when we went on a busy Saturday.   Check this place out, you will not be disappointed.
",1
"Loved Moon! The music was awesome and the crowd was great too. I went with like 14 of my friends and had a blast! We didn't have bottle service but the bouncer was nice enough to let us use an unreserved bottle service area. The only part that got me mad was the leaving part. You know how some clubs you have to try really hard to get IN Well we practically had to beg them to let us leave! They use an elevator and theres like a hundred people going up and down! It's really annoying but still loved it!

"When damaging your liver it's best to use only the freshest and best quality ingredients and if you want to do some serious damage then you should definitely check out Mardi Gras.  They freshly squeeze the oranges and grapefruits in front of you for your Screwdrivers and Greyhounds so you don't have to worry about nasty impurities from the fruit juice ruining your cocktail.  Why make your liver work harder than it already has to.

"My personal favorite Pittsburgh bar. Notorious for fresh juice and strong drinks. For the first few years I lived in pgh this was our standard last stop before heading home. Not once did I remember leaving the bar. Things have slowed down a bit since then, mostly because I've also learned to never order more then two drinks. It's also tiny, so if you want to sit down, get there early (or go during the week). Weekend crowds are ass to crotch throughout the entire place.

"""Alright you bunch of booze bags, go home.""  I would probably end up staying for days on end if I wasn't told that at the end of the night.Great DrinksGreat Juke boxGreat Crowdand, wait for it........ a mrs. packman machine.

"Strong drinks, dark and smoky, cozy booths, great juke box.  This is a bar, this is your neighborhood bar.  If you need to meet someone for a drink and just talk it out - this is the place.  A good friend of mine always points out the ugly carpet.  Yep, the carpet here is ugly, but at least it is new.  And the place is dark so you never really see the carpet anyways.

"MS. PAC-MAN...drinks, and cool laid back setting, with great jukebox..very mellow, sit back, sip, and listen to buckets of rain by dylan and your night is complete

"I lived across the street from Mardi Gras for a year.  It was a pleasure I can't begin to describe.
",1
"This is a total hidden gem. I was unaware that this bar existed till a friend took me here. We were sitting across the street at Mario's and he says to me, ""You want to go some place else and get some STRONG drinks"" This proposition not only got me excited, but piqued my interest. Where are we going and why don't I know about this placeOnce we made it inside and up the long set of stairs (I can see myself taking a digger down these after a few Manhattens) you enter the dark, semi smokey bar. This place is divey but not dirty. It just looks they decorated it about 25 years ago and if it was good enough then, damnit its good enough now. The juke box is loaded with classic jazz and blues and normally operates at the guidance of the bartender (which is fine by me, he has good taste.)The bartender is one of those guys whose career has been behind the bar. He makes his drinks fast, tall, and strong. The average cocktail (whiskey and coke, vodka and juice, gin and tonic) run about $6 and some of their others (Manhattan, martinis, etc) cost $8. The prices are higher than some may be used to, but relax, its worth it. You are getting a rocks glass with little ice, filled nearly to the top with your booze of choice, and a mist of whatever else you wanted to water down the drink. If I'm going to spend $15 in a bar I would rather drink 2 well made, strong drinks than drink 15 cups of coke each with an eye dropper's worth whiskey.  If you want a place to listen to some good music, get schwacked on liquor, and enjoy some conversation, Mardi Gras is you joint.
",1
"Some serious old school 80's glamour waits up the long flight of stairs to Marti Gras.  There's something magical about this dive--even the smoke doesn't seem to bother me...Actually, it's probably the strong drinks that are responsible for that...Which may be made with magic.  Who can say  But I'm a sucker for any sort of sweet vodka cocktail in a martini glass, and the drinks here will knock a girl off her heels.  Luckily, there's always an attentive bartender waiting to mix one more cocktail.But this ain't no college dive.  You won't find too many kids in here, which I appreciate.  It's dark up those stairs and the jukebox jazz is often questionable, but the booths are cozy and the drinks are tall and the beer selection is more than decent.  I'll take it.P.S. - It was cash only last time I checked.
",1
"This is one of my favorite bars in Pittsburgh! The drinks will punch you in the face, if that weird looking guy next to you won't. It's a great escape from the bro-scene that is most of Walnut St. and they have booths which themselves would be enough to make me love this place. I've had many sloppy nights here and made many stranger friends. Order a greyhound and watch the bartender squeeze fresh juice into your drink and kick it with strangers at the bar.

"Mardi Gras is a far cry from most other bars in Shadyside, and in the best possible way.  Dark, smoky, smaller than most establishments, frequented by older patrons and a jukebox with fantastic music from the 60s onward are just a few traits that make Mardi Gras a fantastic barroom.Add to that exceptionally strong, but delicious, drinks, and bartenders that like to keep their clients pleased, and you've got a combination that's hard to find anywhere else in Pittsburgh.  Mardi Gras also has a perfect nostalgic feeling to it.  The wall across from the bar is lined with several large booths that easily accommodate a group of five or six and invite conversation over your stiff drinks.The bar is cash only, which may seem like a little deterrent, but after you've had a couple mixed drinks you'll probably thank yourself for not being able to charge away too many more.  Not to mention the awesome cash register that looks like it's about 90 years old.By far, Mardi Gras is my preferred bar in Shadyside, and you can't go wrong if you're in the mood for a strong drink.

"When I die, I want my ashes scattered at Phil's.Sports on television; decent music; cheap beer specials; convenient uptown location; and friendly, attractive waitresses.  I'm not sure what else you could ask forFor those of you wondering where the deli is, in this Deli-Tavern, it is simple:  At lunchtime, it's a deli--anything with pastrami or corned beef is decent on the menu.  In the evening, it's a tavern--eat before you drink, unless you want appetizers (which are half price from 4-6).

"I'm from Chicago suburbs, so I'm used to townie dive bars and this place is great! The service was great! Richard, the manager was fantastic and made us feel at home.

"The bar is now called Slice's. Bullit is gone (thank god). Great friendly service, great food and the owner is cute as a button. Justin no longer works there but Kimmy and Brian will treat you right. There mixology is beyond reproach. Great fish fry and even better burgers.

"I try to not speak like a rapper, but ""haters gonna hate.""Seriously, this place is a dive bar, not a high-end french restaurant.  The servers sometimes double as bartenders.  You do not go to this place for the fast service, that is what people made McDonald's for.  You go for the 1lb. burgers!  They range from $7-$8.  How do they make moneyIs it the best burger  No.  Is it in the top 5 of burgers that I have eaten  Yes.  Definitely.  Everything is well thought out right down the to the bun choice.  The burgers all come with kettle chips.  I hate kettle chips.  Hate them.  You know what  I ate theirs.  So good.  Yeah, the service took awhile, but you do not go to a dive bar to get out of there fast.  The server was friendly and precise (I did not want onions, I did not get onions).  That care barely be said about high end restaurants.  It was nice to sit back and relax and then the burger came.  They are huge.  I had a cheeseburger.  I barely made it through half.  They are cooked medium well, but they are still so juicy.  The vegetables are fresh and generous.  I had two pieces of tomato large enough that one covered the burger.  My friend had the bacon cheeseburger.  I could barely see the burger under the bacon.  It was amazing.  I dared not try that on my first time out.  I can not wait to try their hot ham and cheese.  It comes with two HUGE slices of ham.  They have brunch on Sundays.  I am talking myself down from finding any excuse to go there again.

"If you are craving a massive bar burger from a towny bar, this is the place to go. The burgers are so large that you should plan on cutting it in half and take the other half home. They are excellent!If you order the bacon burger, you can expect at least 6 plus long stripes on bacon on it, I was completely amazed with the quantity and quality of the burger. Amazing. I have also been to the Eagle Crest on Taco Tuesday. Prepare yourself for the largest taco you will ever see. If you order the taco salad they give you a very large plate stacked high with chips and all the fixings. It's great. More than any one person can eat in one sitting. This is a bar people! Don't expect proper waitress service, the bar tenders are serving you most of the time. Just be happy that this particular bar has amazing food. Since this is a bar, maybe the best Bloody Mary in town. It comes in a large mug with 2 huge shrimp, a beef stick, pickle, and green olives. A meal in itself. If your hungry and don't want to spend a lot of money, this is the place I would suggest.My new favorite bar.

"Yum, yum, yum.  I felt the need to update the restaurant.  Nothing has changed and that is what I love!Consistency is appreciate when the quality is so high.  I appreciate that their burgers are as special, juicy and flavorful as always.  They are not trying to dress up the place or make things so fancy.  The truth is, they stick to good, simply and quality food.  So thank you for staying the same and staying fabulous.

"One liner:  perch rocksIf you are looking for an awesome perch fish fry, Villa is your place.  One of the best I have eaten...light greasing and no grease.  It is Canadian Lake perch if that matters to anyone.Small and cozy neighborhood bar!

"My husband and I love this little gem of a neighborhood bar. We are constantly on the hunt for best ""bar burger"" (so we have a lame hobby...whatever, it's fun!) and we agree that Villa Tap is one of the best bar burgers in town. Jenny St ground chuck, fresh veggies on the burgs, good bun, also they have good apps (love the cheddar broccoli bites)...all good so far. Good Bloody Mary's too. We haven't tried the fish fry yet, but it's on the to-do list. We actually went there for Valentine's Day - wanted to avoid the crowds, in the mood for a good cheeseburger, etc - had a great time. The burgers were top-notch, jukebox is great (they have a weird abundance of live Dead, which is great). The regular customers are nice and friendly also - it's not an intimidating ""townie-bar"" (hello, Tip Top!) but the regulars are SO nice and fun to talk to. Owner Chico is really nice, and we love that he's going out of his way to buy local ingredients and beer. He's got House of Brews on tap even! Unusual fact - the inside of the bathroom stalls are painted with chalkboard paint and have chalk available to write messages. We really don't have complaints at this point. We're excited to try their brunch soon!

"If you are looking for a no frills Friday night fish fry that will blow your mind, this is your place. I am giving this place 5 stars because it is wonderful for a very simple meal, with excellent service.  We had a little trouble finding the door (the entrance is in the back facing away from Packers Ave.) but once we walked in and sat at one of their wobbly tables, we were instantly greeted by our friendly server.  Though the bar was busy, we got our drinks immediately, along with a basket with two basic white bread rolls and coleslaw.  All very standard issue.  The fish was another story. Whoa.  I got the Canadian perch and my boyfriend got the Canadian walleye.  The large single piece of walleye was lightly breaded and fried perfectly.  It was buttery, non-fishy, and totally delicious.  The baked potato that came with it was pretty standard, but good.  The perch was battered differently in a thicker, more crunchy coating.  The little strips were just AMAZING.  I got a pile of 7 or 8 strips that I honestly couldn't stop eating.  The fries were done to perfection as well.  My boyfriend and I are somewhat light eaters in general, but we cleared out all of that fried goodness in one sitting.  On the way out the cooks from the back yelled good bye, the bartender wished us a good night, and someone standing by the door smiled and asked us to come back soon.  I can't say enough about how friendly everyone here is.  It looks like a burned out biker bar, but their simple menu is done right.  I never thought I would like a place so much that doesn't have salad on their menu, but I anticipate we will be back many many more times.

"Looks sketch from the outside, but true fish fry happiness awaits! I have been going to this place for about one year.  The first time we went later around 9 pm or so and a lot of the fish was gone.  I had an amazing hamburger instead, meat from Jenifer St Market. Besides the first time, I have always gotten the fish.  The perch is amazing and be sure to get the loaded baked potato.  The craft beer selection is impressive.  Chico-the owner is usually cooking, it's a small kitchen, so be prepared to wait, but it's worth it. My fiance usually gets the walleye and loves it. It's now my go to place for fish!

"I started going here on and off about eight years ago. The pizza is the best, but the burgers (veggie and regular) are very good as well. It's bar food at its very best. Hot chips with dipping sauce are good too! There's often bands on the weekends, and the occasional lesbian after bowling league get together, but not angry, man-hating, shemales. Quite a few different groups of people get together for good beer, food and music at reasonable prices.

"Some of the best bar food in the state.  Burgers and Pizza are always a fantastic choice.  Entertainment is hit or miss, but at least they have some.  However, my favorite reason to go here is it serves the coldest tap beer ever!!!

"The Harmony - or the Har Bar as my friends call it, is always an inviting and friendly place to have a beer.  It's a neighborhood bar in the truest sense of the word, locals walk and bike to the place which is situated in one of the greatest areas of Madison.  The food is really nice, an up-scaled bar menu.  The signature dish, the ""Walnut Burger"" is truly fantastic.  Forget about it as a meat-alternative, this burger is a unique creation all its own that will make you have desperate cravings.  The space is large, divided in two, one half the main bar area and the other a large space with family-style tables where groups gather and bands sometimes play at night.  Here you will find the livers of the pure Madison lifestyle celebrating their lives.  These people are happy and they might just make you happy too.

"The hubby and I always default to Harmony Bar when we have a craving for a good burger and a local brew (even before noon). My favorite is the blue burger-a burger smothed in blue cheese and all the traditional toppings. The pizzas are worth waiting for-check on the days and times they'll make a pizza for you.As always a smoke free environment is worth driving to Madison for.

"Oh how I miss you, Harmony Bar!  I never miss a chance to grab a walnut burger and hot chips when I'm back in town.  This is just a wonderful neighborhood bar.  The food is still ""bar"" food but it's quality, tasty and made fresh to order.  The pizza is good, too.  Good beer selection and a truly local atmosphere.  The Harmony fits right into the vibe of the neighborhood.Oh how I miss you, Harmony Bar!

"The perfect place for the near-east side. Good to very good drinks (depending on the bar tender) and yummy pub food -- especially the walnut burger. It has a workaday feel, with a side of liberal politics and an accepting and welcoming attitude. Somehow it's not overpopulated with posers which makes it just about my favorite place in town.

I use to be a vegetarian and I would dream about eating that thing, better than meat any day of the week.I use to use to...  Good times :)

I enjoy the food, the walnut burger was super different and interesting, and although I prefer the beef it was fun to try something different.The rest of the food was as good as bar food gets, but the staff and general feel of the bar (I love the old school jukebox!) makes it 5 stars for me.

"These are the best chicken strips I have ever had.  I went to Ohio and ate at Raising Cane's which is a chicken strips franchise and they paled in comparison.  Even in the city of Chicago you will not find a chicken strip as good as here.  They are huge! If these were indeed the fingers of a chicken they would be of some mutant killer robot chicken that could probably kill us all.The service can be pretty surly and they are kind of nickel and dime nazis with the water and sauce.  But the chicken...oh the chicken.

"Great pizza on mondays deal!4.99 for a large pizza with cheese off of EatCu.comI got a large with half steak and half italian beef.Let me say, it was the most delicious hearty pizza I have ever had for 6 bucks. I usually get Papa Johns large pineapple for 5 bucks, but it gets old. This is good ""Italian"" pizza. (as italian as they say they are.)Anyway, I keep reading all these rave reviews about the chicken tenders, and as I waited for my pizza, multiple people came in and ordered those chicken tenders, so they must be good.But back to my pizza, it was AMAZING. I took 2 slices and and im not even hungry anymore. THis baby is gonna last me for the rest of the night and at least 1 slice for breakfast tomorrow.55 stars A+

"This was one of my top places to go on campus. It's cheap, the food is delicious and you get EXTREMELY large portions. I probably have tried everything on their menu from one time to another and they definitely do a better job with certain dishes than others. But the ones they do well can't be beat. The Top 5 things are: 1. Chicken Fingers - These things are the sizes of your forearm and come with a great honey mustard sauce. Bet you can't finish a 5-piece! 2. Gyro - I love their gyro's! Even though you have Zorba's and Niro's Gyros close by I would still go with Geo's if not just for their shear size! You can fill up just on eating off the top of the pile of meat before even making it to the pita bread! 3. Calzones - They have so many different ones to choose from but I would say the Fighting Illini, the Italiano, and the Steak Bomb top the list. Again, these things are massive so be prepared for leftovers! 4. Baked Mostaccioli - Amazing pasta dish with a layer of melted cheese across the top! I would recommend getting it with meat sauce and some sausage or meatballs in there as well. 5. Godfather Sandwich - Don't settle for the regular Italian Beef or you are just shorting yourself for no reason. With the Godfather you get a huge Italian beef with melted cheese on GARLIC bread. So good! The only downside with this place is you have to be ready for a wait if you're going around dinner time or after the bars close because it gets packed. But at the same time you know it's good if there's a line out the door every night!  I miss you Geovanti's!

"Cheap, amazing chicken strips.Everything else I've had here is kind of low quality though.  The pasta sauce has no flavor and the gyros are garbage.However, the chicken strips deserve the 5 star rating due to the great value and the great taste.

"Two cheers for Geo's Chicken Strips. I'm pretty sure these chickens have been plumped and primed with steroids cause these strips are no joke.I'm also pretty sure I represented 5% of their customer base for free chicken strip coupons.

Might take awhile for your call to go through.Honey mustard and BBQ sauce. All day.

A lot of alums with their original mug club cards.  While there were still a lot of students so that the place didn't look like a retirement home, I found that while I was standing in line for the bathroom that I was the youngest in line at 50.

When I walked in I was immediately created by Bill who was warm and friendly. Anna came out to perform the measurements and mark up the suit. She checked everything, even changes I hadn't thought to have made to make sure the suit fits me perfectly when they are done. Best of all, when I asked if they could ship the suits to me at my house since I no longer live in Pittsburgh, they asked when I was leaving town and promised they would get it done for me before I left  the next day. Better yet, they had the suit ready for me early, avoiding the rush for me to pick it up before I left. Everyone was extremely helpful and diligent and I will continue to only get changes done at this store.

"oh, Eons, how you've spoiled me so.I remember visiting Richard's shop when it was where Hey Betty! is now.  Trying on monkey fur trimmed capes and Hungarian peasant vests.  Needless to say, they know me and my chihuahua by name.Eon's selection is amazing.  Richard is a collector, a curator, a Pittsburgh god of vintage.  He hand selects every piece in the shop and will not sell anything if a seam is ripped, a button or belt is missing, or if it's just stupid. He has every item laundered and pressed to perfection.  Everything is a gem, and Richard will tell you a bit about where he got the piece and why its design is important.  PRICEY!!  gawd.  Everything at Eons is a bargain for the quality you are getting.Growing up on Eons' vintage has spoiled me for any other vintage store.  I hold every other one up to its standards.  Thus, vintage in LA is a joke.  A cruel, un-laundered, over-priced, wrinkled, moth-eaten joke of the thrift variety.
",1
"I love the clothes he has, I love the prices, I love how helpful Richard is.  It's got a great location, and it's relative to Hey Betty!  Which is another pretty good vintage shop.  Eons is better though.  They have clothes for all sizes and shapes.  Beautiful shoes and jewelry as well.  And Richard (god of vintage) is just a gem to talk to!
",1
"I think I died and went to vintage nirvana when I stepped into Eons back in May. Every single piece is elegant, beautiful, and either close to mint condition or mint condition. Richard, the guy that runs the store, knows about every piece in the store and a bit of its history. Literally, the store is like walking into a museum of clothing from the 1940s-1980s. Hey Betty is really great too, although sometimes it doesn't have the sizes I need (I'm a petite 0-2). Also look up when you walk around the store. Some of the sweetest hats I have ever seen (I don't know where they find the stuff in that GREAT quality) are at Eons. Main point: If you love vintage, you will LOVE Eons.
",1
"You want style  You want selection  You want clothes that have been respectfully honored for the wearable vintage art they are  Go here!!!  The owner Richard is top-notch and knows his stuff inside and out.   My only regret is that I didn't have more days to visit...maybe that good thing, because honestly, I don't think I would have left the store.  If I lived in Pittsburgh, I'd be making weekly (maybe even daily) journeys to the store.I'm an experienced vintage shopper and baby - it doesn't get better than this!  And the prices - very reasonable for the quality of the clothing, which is all cleaned and tenderly loved.
",1
"This is a vintage shoppers paradise!  The place is stocked full of original vintage finds from the 1920's and on.  It may be packed full but it's easy to navigate between the different decades as they are clearly marked in select sections.  The prices aren't outrageous if you're looking for something unique for a special dinner or event.  You can tell that the owner goes above and beyond to find the best vintage selections.  It's not just clothes too, but gorgeous jewelry and a very unique selections of vintage eyewear.
",1
"Sometimes I come all the way to Pittsburgh from Akron JUST to visit Eons.  The employees are friendly & knowledgeable.  The clothing is very well organized, separated by era and then by size.  This is one of the only vintage clothing stores I've been to in the country that has a large selection of deadstock items, complete with their original tags.  The dresses I have purchased here are absolutely amazing, many of them never worn.  I will continue to visit on my quarterly P-burgh visits!

"Eons was the first vintage store I ever went to at the tender age of 15 when I was going through my rockabilly phase.  I've gone back many times since, and even got my junior year homecoming dress and accessories here (it was a red '50s swing dress).  It remains the best vintage store in Pittsburgh, and possibly the best vintage place I've been to period.  Eons carries mainly clothing, shoes, accessories and jewelry from the '40-'80s, but don't be surprised to find pieces from the very early 1900s!  It's organized by men's and women's clothing, then by type of garment, and then by size.  Speaking of sizes, there is a wide selection, which is so nice as a larger vintage-lover. Everything is in tip-top condition and very reasonably priced, and the staff are beyond helpful and knowledgeable.  I've never left empty handed at Eons, and I dare you to not find something you love!
",1
"There are thrift stores and there are vintage stores.  There are some stores that are a blend of the two.  And then there's Eons.  Eons goes beyond your average vintage shop in that it could be considered a museum of fashion.   A lot of their stuff is one-of-a kind antique clothing.  You can easily find stuff from the 1930s up to the 1980s.  Heck, in a few years we'll be looking at 1990s grunge here--time to dig out the Soundgarden CDs.  I once bought a clutch purse here.  I stopped in the other day and even though I couldn't find anything that quite caught my eye, it was still a lot of fun poking around in here.
",1
"I lovvvvve this place. It's really well organized, employees are friendly, and I never leave without buying something. Last time I was here I got two necklaces (the jewelry is great), a quilted jacket, and a blazer with polka dot lining.I always make a stop here when I'm back in Pittsburgh.

"Meticulously organized and a great selection. Definitely worth a stop.

"We went to the Men's Wearhouse to outfit our wedding party with tuxes. We worked with Jack, who assisted us beyond our expectations. It turned out that we could buy suits for all of the groomsmen for less than a tux rental would cost. This meant that our wedding party got to keep their suits after the wedding and use them for business or other purposes - they were theirs! Jack assisted us in picking out the perfect shirts and ties, which we gifted to the groomsmen as our wedding gift. I don't think we could have picked out anything ourselves that would have worked as well as what he helped us find.Everyone looked great, and the best part was that they got to walk away from the wedding with a brand new suit, shirt, and tie for less than the price that they would have spent to rent a tux. And I've returned a tux many times after being a part of a wedding party - often not a fun thing to do the morning after before you catch a flight out of town.Jack has continued to be a great resource, alerting me to sales and helping me pick out what's best for my business attire even after wedding. I used to be a solely Brooks Brothers guy when it comes to dress shirts, mainly because I travel a lot and value the non-iron shirts that BB offers (I HATE ironing shirts). But Jack introduced me to lines that Men's Wearhouse carries and the non-iron shirts there are just as good if not better than those at Brooks Brothers. Though a bit pricey at about $85-95shirt normally, Men's Wearhouse offers frequent 2 for 1 sales that make these shirts a bargain at $42-47.I can't speak about anyone other than Jack (he seems to always be there!), but I can't recommend him or this store highly enough. If you are looking to outfit your wedding party, or just in need of some business clothes, talk to him - he will take care of you!

"My husband and I walked in here to get fitted for a tux. We are in a wedding out of state and just needed measurements. The man was very friendly and got my husband completely measured in 2 mins flat! And for no charge, even though we weren't ordering the tux from them. Score!

"Dallas was a beyond helpful associate at the store. After searching the malls I finally convinced my bf to check out this store. Great, individualized service! It was especially refreshing after dealing with the not so friendly or helpful department store associates.My bf was in a little bit of a bind, needing nice slacks for an upcoming interview. Luckily the Men's Wearhouse has finished bottoms in many sizes and the bf walked out with a couple of pairs of pants, socks, and a belt. Of course, they pushed dress shirts and ties and shoes but with a simple, ""no thanks"" we moved on. Dallas made the shopping experience easy and quick. Give that man a raise!!!

"The customer service here was top notch! We came in to find a suit for my man, he is 6'6 and thin so finding clothes to fit him is near impossible. We were greeted by Steve as soon as we walked in. Before we know it he had the measuring tape out and several different suit options in hand. He also gave recommendations on shirt and tie combinations. They were having a 40% off sale on the entire store so we got a great deal. They were also able to tailor the suit pants within 4 days. I now have the exact pant and shirt measurements which will make it easy for future shopping extravaganzas.Thanks Steve! You did a great job.

"Men's wearhouse has always been really hit or miss for me- usually more miss than hit. Had a bad expeerince with the tuxes for my wedding. Same thing with my brother in laws wedding. Same thing with a few other trips. Somehow, this trip was a completely different experience. Had to get a shirt and tie for a ""dress nice please"" event so I figured, what the H. Stopped in and was greeted by Carmello. Said a nice hello and let me do my thang. After I couldn't find the shirt I was looking for he jumped in to help- The dude was awesome, by far the best service experience I have ever had at any one of their stores. I got my shirt, a matching tie and a new belt, all for about $100- not bad. He took my measurements right so I got stuff that is comfortable too (kind of the key to getting me to wear it a second time) and was that perfect balance of offering suggestions combined with actually listening to what I was saying. I can honestly say this guy will bring me back here!

"Last minute trip east and had to have a sports coat and tie. Went to the MW on Camelback and they had the perfect set up. Problem aw, it was a 2 for1 sale.....man I'm traveling! Don't have room for 2 coats, 2 shirts and 2 ties that I will never wear.No can do!! They explain....so my search, just by chance, took me to the MW on Tatum.Enter Travis and Rich. I explained the situation....and they're answer was ""you get we can take care of you!""  we found the same coat....the same shirt....and an even better tie!   And they discounted to the sale price for the one set!!  Now that's service!! And that's why I come back!!  To bad the other guy didn't get the memo!!!Great job Travis and Rich!!

"Oh my gosh I had a blast shopping with my brother today at the Men's Wearhouse! Ren was the most awesome sales guy ever and I highly recommend you go see him. I usually hate shopping but Ren made the experience exciting and fun. Please go see Ren for all your business wear needs and tell him Dione and Joseph sent you, you will not be disappointed I promise you. Thank you Ren for everything!

"We enjoyed working with the staff at this location to decide on the tuxes for our wedding. We did a fair amount of online research into the color  style we were aiming for and knew which suit we really wanted to see upon arrival.We were greeted as we entered the store and the employee walked us directly over to the suit we were seeking so that we could see the fit and ensure it was good to go. The exact size that we needed was not available in the store, however, they were happy to order it for us and it was in within about a week.  They do alterations on site, so you don't need to worry about the suit being sent offsite and they take about two weeks to get done (they will rush them for you if needed - we had the time).  Tomorrow we plan to pick up his altered suit and we'll be all set to go!All the groomsmen seemed to have good experiences in their local stores as well, so it's not a bad chain to choose for all the men in you party if you are looking for a good national chain to make things convenient like we were!Overall: AGreat experience, quick order fulfillment and alterations on site.  We would recommend them to friends!

"Was in town for a brother's wedding and somehow my jacket sleeve ripped. Going to a tailor would take too long so I checked out Men's Warehouse which was having another sale.I am skeptical of places that always seem to have sales but I got a great deal on two jackets. The store selection was good (found my exact size), especially considering they were having a sale and the place was crowded.I forgot the name of the guy who helped me but, wow, it was like I was the only guy in the place. I got some compliments on my new jacket and had a great time at the wedding.  I got my original jacket repaired and decided to donate it to my church's social program.

"Just recently dealt with these guys for my wedding. Tux fitting went amazing and to be honest the entire staff was awesome every time we came in and Paul constantly went above and beyond for us. We even had a problem with my dads tux and the men's wear house in Tucson and Paul fixed it all up here. These guys are a cut above and made the experience to be the absolute least stressful aspect of the entire wedding prep and ceremony! Thanks again!

"This store has treated me so well since April of 2013, I buy a lot of suitsshirts and they have always been a pleasure to deal with. Jason is really nice and the rest of the staff has always been easy to deal with and very kind. I highly recommend this store, and definitely getting your suits tailored here as well!

"I have no idea how to dress my husband and neither does he, so I went here asking for help. Dakota the salesmen who helped me is such a pro. Friendly, knowledgable and put together several options. He should style for men's magazines. Thank you Dakota!

"I went in on a Saturday to buy a suit. I was very impressed with the sales associate, Emmett, who was incredibly friendly and helpful. After getting measured for the tailoring, Emmett told me that it would take until (I think) Thursday. I explained that I would need the suit a bit sooner than that. Emmett was very accomodating and arranged for it to be available Tuesday. Perfect!Emmett was also great in that when I explained my budget constraints, he didn't try to upsell me (which has happened before) and he didn't leave me when he found out that I wasn't a big spender.I like the way I look in the suit, which is also important. But it's the high standard of excellent service that has won me as a client for as long as I need suits. Bottom line, gentlemen, if you need a suit, go talk to Emmett.

"I am a sales associate for a company called Sleep America.  I have an appreciation for sales techniques and I am a tough critic. I was greeted immediately by a man named Alex Parsons with a smile. He was dressed sharp and was very clean cut. He asked a few qualifying questions which I appreciated. I had brought in an expensive pair of shoes with me in hopes to find a belt to match. He asked for the shoe and immediately found a great belt in my size. He then asked if I would be interested in a pair of slacks to try it on with. (which was a seamless transition into an upsell... much appreciated) but the important thing to note... he asked not told. I said absolutely I would. He pulled around 6 options and continued to explain the different materials as well as styles. I decided on a flat front pair of pants made of whool. (great quality as well) I asked for a shirt to complete my ensemble. Unfortunately I have a difficult body frame and have a difficult time finding the correct fit and size. He even went to the trouble of asking the tailor to take a look. I felt like I was getting royal treatment and Alex spent a great amount of time with me, answering all of my questions, and meanwhile tidying up the store and giving me space. I decided to purchase the slacks, with a permanent crease, and had them hem the slacks as well. I was out the door with a new belt, a pair of great slacks and shoe pollish to boot! Thank you Alex for all of your great work. I have already referred a co-worker and he purchased two pairs of slacks and two shirts. The Tempe Marketplace store is fantastic, but more importantly, Alex was fantastic. I would prep him for a promotion if I was in management because he has all of the qualities of a manager. If anyone is reading this and thinking of purchasing from this location, call and ask for Alex. He really suprised me because many of the reviews are so-so. He was unlike any other associate at nordstrom or macys (which is where I usually get my clothing) Call and set an appointment with him, you won't regret it!Thanks again, Alex Danesi

"I love this location! Ask for Sandra in the Tux section - she does image consulting and will give you the, ""God's honest truth"" about your fashion picks.

"Used this location for my Wedding Tux rental.  There are 11 total rentals for my upcoming wedding - Me, Best Man, 5 Groomsmen, 2 Dads (biological and step), and 2 ring bearers (twin boys).  They got me in, and out in about 30 minutes for the initial meeting.  They explained all the options, pricing, etc.  Very professional.  The ""kid"" (probably 22) didn't provide much assistance or recommendations...but the other staffers that assisted me did.  This part of the review I would give 4 stars - slightly better than average serviceetc.  1 star deducted because I HAVE to pick up the tux 2 days before the wedding and not the day before.Popped in there this past weekend for the fittingmeasurements - was in and out in 5 minutes!  But then I decided to browse (bc using the voucher towards a new suit vs the free tux).  Emmett H. - was there to assist me. I didn't think I needed assistance (bought many suits in my life) - but Emmett was great.  He has a calm professional demeanor about him.  He was very knowledgeable about all the suits and the origins, fabric, stitching, etc.  Very very helpful.  He then helped me look at this fantastic suit - Italian made, imported wool, German stitching style - Top Notch.  I can't wait to pick it up.  Emmett said he has 2 (I believe) FT Tailors on-hand and can have the alterations done relatively quickly (permitting demand).  I think Emmett is my new Suit-Guy in AZ!Overall - 4.5 stars.  Emmett gets 5, the store 4, so overall 4.5.

"As a recent college graduate, I went to get a suit for my current and future job interviews. I already had a list of my preference in hand as I walked into the store. I was immediately greeted by a sales associate who looked over my list and found exactly what I wanted. The suit he grabbed also qualified for their buy one, get one free program so I ended up getting two suits. My interview was the next day, so they were able to get it tailored in time for the interview and I pick up my second suit today (one week later). I was in and out in 30 minutes. Yes, they will try to sell you dress shirts, ties, socks, shoes, tie bars, etc, but if you know what you want, then its not a big deal. I highly recommend this location (by superstition mall) and will be returning here in the future to get alterations done on some of my other clothes.

"One of the disadvantages of being a lean, tall guy that likes to stay in shape is that it is absolutely impossible to find clothes that fit.  My neck is small, and my arms are long, so I have no choice but to have my clothing either custom-manufactured or altered.Artful Tailoring is on point in all regards.  The owner, Aladdin Dimas, a native of Damascus, Syria, has been learning the trade since he was 14.  He knows cool, and he knows how to accentuate the best and worst parts of the human figure.  His prices are very fair, and his textile collection is world-class.Go check him out.  He's put together an above-average website which you can access by clicking on the above link to the business' info, and I suggest you do so.In the market for a new shirt  Don't settle for a 'fitted' Kenneth Cole... go give Aladdin a shot!  He'll make you look like a million bucks!

"Located in the corner of a strip mall located at the SWC of Elliot and Dobson on the northwest side of Chandler.  Don't freak over the word Chandler, its just a bit east of the 101.  Worth the drive.  Nice, unassuming.  Does great work.  I hate when I get pants hemed and the tailor plays chicken and egg with you.       ""Do you want it like this (moves the pant leg up 14"") or like this     (moves it down)""  This guy will take one look, make a mark and done.  Perfect every time.

"This guy altered a pair of my jeans and a fancy dress of mine, and both items came out PERFECT!Quick turn around time too.Love it.

"Ahhh, my favorite place for tailoring! Us short people rely on places like Artful Tailoring. It's been a while since I have been in, but I have given them everything from my Lucky Brand sweats, to Ann Taylor slacks to an old pair of jeans for mending! I've never had a bad experience here and their prices are fair. Service is fantastic and you can count on your clothes being ready when promised! The store is clean and has an upscale feel. Aladdin is knowledgeable and friendly. They are great at difficult jobs or specialty items too! Won't ever go anywhere else.

"I have bee going to Artful Tailoring for about 5 years since I moved to the valley and the work is execptional.I have had two custom made dress shirts made and about 25 other shirts redone to fit me better.The work is high quality and well done, highly recommend it to everyone.

"I don't wear suits often, so I totally appreciated their advise on what will make me look my best.  Extremely professional, and they really know their stuff.  After they showed me the tailoring that needed to be done, I could really see how a good suit is supposed to look.  This place rocks.  If I had to do it all over again, I would visit the Tailor BEFORE even going out to buy a suit.  He helps you know what to look for in a suit.

"What can I say about this place but it is wonderful! I had three dresses altered there and the prices where way less than I expected to pay. My sister-in-law took her wedding dress there for a rush fix and he did it so quickly and perfectly, I would recommend Artful Tailoring to anyone.

"Best tailor I've found in the Valley. I'm very short and very particular about fit & length, and he gets it right to a T. He's talented, personable, and charges a fair price.BTW, I don't get all the bad reviews - are we even talking about the same tailor

"I have been more than impressed by Artful Tailoring in making some custom shirts for me.  They have done a lot of alterations for my jeans, as well as a suit that I bought there.  Seems to be more than legit, so not sure why the negative reviews here...I guess some people just do not ""mesh"".  I would highly recommend their services to anyone at this point.

"A few years ago, I had an unfortunate experience at Artful Tailoring. Recently, the owner reached out to me after reading review. He regretted the situation and wanted to make it right.I have a back log of clothes that need to be altered so I was happy to meet with him again. I knew he could be trusted with the more complicated items (i.e. anything other than pants that need hemming) because of the work he did for me previously.This time I had two dresses taken in at the shoulders and a pair of jeans taken in at the waist. The first dress had embroidery at the shoulders so he did an ""easy fix"" that involves folding the material. I was a little hesistant at first, but it looks good and fits even better. I've never had jeans taken in before so I was worried how they would turn out. Now my beloved mint jeans fit perfectly with just two small darts sewn in the back. They aren't really noticable, and besides, I usually wear my shirts untucked anyways.All the work was ready when promised. I'll be back soon to have some more clothing shortened to fit my midget frame.

"A few weeks ago I heard a story that this location was selling suits 2 for 1.  I didn't believe this until I got there.  How could any place make a deal like this  I ended up getting paired up with a guy named Gabe.  Instantly I thought he was your typical men's clothing store kind of guy until I started peppering him with questions.  Very quickly it became apparent Gabe knew a lot more about both casual and business suits.  I had specific ideas for my suits as they needed to breathe well.  After showing me several different types of suits Gabe picked out 5 suits and I loved eash instantly.  I then had to cut down to two suits for the final purchase.  He then talked about the positives and negatives of each suit.  There wasn't any BS spewing, just facts and numbers and personal opinion.  I will be back to the store monthly to see what the latest sales.  Thanks for all your help Gage!  Sorry to ask a million questions.

"Awesome staff! The guy who helped me was named Skip happened to be a suit wizard and got me in and out with exactly what I was looking for.

"I give this place six stars and a bag of chips!!I was an usher in a wedding today. When I arrived at church, i realized that I left my tie (which was by design the same as the other ushers and groomsmen) at home and did not have enough time to go home to get it...SO with the help of Yelp, I found a nearby Men's Wearhouse and called them to explain the problem while heading over. They said they had a silver tie but it might not match exactly. At this point I'm like ""a silver tie that doesn't exactly match is waaaaay the heck better than NO tie"".When I got there an EXTREMELY nice saleslady informed me that they had the exact silver tie over at another store and she would be happy to:1. Give me the almost-but-not-perfectly-matching silver tie so I could get back to the church to get to my usher duties and2. Drive up to the store that had the exact matching tie and then drive over to the church to DELIVER IT...Now, like most folks, I don't love asking people I don't know for favors and this was A LOT to ask for a tie, but I've heard brides can be particular about stuff pertaining to their weddings so I figured since she was willing then erroring on the side of safety would be a good way to go. so I left with the one tie to do my usherly duties and a bit later, the unbelievably kind sales lady showed up at church with the legit tie.  Wow... this was so far above and beyond what I've come to expect from anyone in business, I'm still kind of thinking that that will probably never happen again...OH yeah, I forgot... they did all of this for free. I didn't have to pay extra for the tie or her time to run get it. Nada.Anyways, like I said... 6 stars plus a bag of chips.

"I have been a member of GWV Y since it originally opened.  The staff is amazing, the location is amazing and the facility is one of the best maintained fitness centers in Charlotte.My favorite classes are Kickboxing, Cycle, Athletic Conditioning and Zumba.  Note:  I recently started taking Zumba at GWVY and the sessions have been great.The KB instructor is simply amazing.  The class and all of the participants are like a family.   The great thing about the Y also is that we often get together after a great class...and go to some of the best restaurants (see my reviews) in the downtown area.In addition to the great facility, the GWV Y does amazing things for the community and offers great opportunities to volunteer!I highly recommend the GWV Y for total mind, body and spirit!!!****I miss my KB instructor but have really enjoyed taking the occasional Turbo Kick class.

"I worked out here for about a month and a half when I was working in Charlotte.  The locker rooms and the equipment are all very clean, and you always have a fresh towel available to you.  The staff that work here are super nice, friendly, and are always willing to lend a hand.  I like this Y better than the other ones around Charlotte mostly because it's not always super crowded and you almost never have to wait to use a machine.  I really like the classes- especially spin - I forgot her name but my lady (she was pregnant at the time) was always motivating and kept me going!  It's a nice cozy little gym that is very convenient if you live within walking distance.  Parking is readily available too if you aren't.

"This is a really great gym! It's very well maintained and always clean, the equipment is in good shape, and you just can't say no to towel service. The staff and instructors are tremendously nice and helpful, and the crowd is laid back without the ""strutting"" that you can see at other gyms. I never see it packed or desolate, so there's always a good atmosphere of activity without having to stand around waiting on equipment.

"Besides being super convenient to get to, the Gateway Y is clean and the staff is very friendly!My husband and I had been going to the Dowd since we got our membership, and although I like the Dowd, it was getting more and more crowded- having to show up for a class 30 minutes before its starts isn't always feasible!  The Gateway always has plenty of class space- most classes I've attended have had less than 6 people, which is so great!All the equipment is very new and clean and you can always find a machine without any wait time- and never have a problem getting a bike for Spin (even showing up 5 minutes before).This is now our go to Y during the week!

"I love the Gateway Village Y.  The staff are very friendly and do a great job keeping the facility clean.  Unlike some of the other Y's in the area, Gateway is typically not super crowded.  Its a great place to go to take group exercise classes.Be sure to look up the parking codes on their branch website so you can park in the parking lot right beside the Y after 4:30 each weeknight.  Otherwise you have to park in the parking deck up the street.

"This gym is bright, modern, and clean, the staff is friendly and helpful, and they offer a nice variety of group exercise classes (including CrossFit). It's the perfect place to get in a quick workout on your own or try a class.The Gateway Village YMCA is small but I've never seen it overly crowded. Cardio machines and weights are on the main level with the locker rooms; the group exercise rooms are downstairs. Check the website for parking information (I walk there but there's a free lot [with access code] in the evenings and they validate up to 2 hours in the garage).

"By far the best gymwork out facility in Charlotte.  Going to the Dowd Y is like going to work out and then going to the spa, it is a completely rejuvenating experience that's a great way to start... or end your day.

Not only do they have a completely renovated downstairs weight room, a number of racquetball and handball courts, row upon row of exercise bikes, treadmills and elliptical machines, but they also have top notch classes, trainers and programs.  The Dowd has classes at different times throughout the day, so no matter what your schedule, chances are you can find a yoga class, or a spin class that works for you.The Men's Locker Room ( I can't comment on the women's as I've never been in there) also boasts an exercise room featuring cardio machines and some free weights as well as areas to stretch and warm-up. There's also a  huge whirlpool, steam room and sauna.  After a grueling workout, nothing beats the sauna, steam ,shower. combo.  The whirlpool relaxes your muscles.  The sauna opens up your pores, while the steam room helps clean out your respiratory system allowing you to feel revitalized , and the showers wash away the sweat and dirt from your workout preparing you to face the world at the top of your game.The Dowd YMCA is a great place; with state of the art equipment , programs, classes and  people.

"For the money, you really can't beat this deal.  For half as much as I was paying for my gym membership in Chicago, I get an all-access membership to the YMCAs in Charlotte.  The facilities are great, the staff are all helpful, and the Dowd Branch (probably the best location) is near my home.I have heard a lot about the locker break-ins, but have been lucky so far (knock on wood).Nice work, YMCA!

"I grew up attending the Harris YMCA so working downtown and making the switch to the Dowd was quiet a change.  There aren't screaming kids or summer camps just adults getting fit.  The classes there are awesome and pretty much every member of my office takes 1-2 every week.  The women's locker room has a great little work out area of it's own, nestled right in between the lockers and only a few feet away from the showers.  It's perfect for when you need to be in and out, or if you just enjoy working out in a smaller area.  There is a sweet spot for treadmills on the 3rd floor.  They face out so you can watch joggers run up E. Morehead and think about how much harder they are running then you are, as you run in place.  Nevertheless, the 3rd floor is never as crowded as the second and you will definitely see regulars.  The showers are clean and the steam and sauna are perfect for when you feel it's time for a spa day, or even hour.

"The Dowd Y is by far the best workout facility in the area for the money. From their class selection to workout equipment to friendly staff, you can't beat this gym. With a reasonable monthly fee that gives you access to all the YMCAs in Charlotte, this gym is the best bang for your buck. In terms of classes, the Total Strength and Roc-it Circuit Training are great if you like direction when doing any sort of strength training. The Pilates, Yoga, Cardio Dance and Cycle instructors are all quite helpful and make you feel comfortable whether you're a first-timer or partake in a class every day. Only class that gave me pause was Athletic Conditioning - instructor bellowing orders at me over loud speakers for 60 minutes just isn't my cup of tea - but it is apparently a great workout as people come out of it drenched in sweat. I've very rarely seen an ""out-of-order"" sign on any equipment, and with multiple floors (including weight and cardio equipment in the ladies locker room), you hardly ever have to wait for a machine. Staff is uber-helpful and always cheery no matter what time of the day. Fair warning: parking can be a bit difficult in the evenings, and is downright ridiculous in January with all the newcomers. So if you're trying to make one of the multiple group exercise classes, give yourself extra time to park to save yourself some stress. Overall great experience; I highly recommend this gym.

"This Y is by far the best offered in Charlotte.  I really can't think of a reason to give it less than 5 stars.  The only sticky issue can be parking if you come during peak hours.  This facility is spacious with multiple floors of equipment.  There are always receptionists at the front desk available to answer questions (or in my case help me when I forget my card).  I use the women's gym most often which has machines, free weights, sauna, steam room, jacuzzi, and showers.  Not to mention they offer free use of their hair dryers and clean fresh towels!!  The locker room is always in pristine condition.  In fact, I've never walked in when a maintenance woman wasn't there!  They also have an array of classes to meet anyone's needs!  Some of the other services available that I haven't used are:- childcare-pro-shop (sell gym gear, drinks, power bars, etc).-poolLove this place!

"So since I have given up on Inner Peaks (boo) I have needed a new gym to get myself back into shape...a couple friends recommended Dowd and after a tour I was convinced this would be a great place for me. Wow this gym is like Globo gym in Dodge-Ball!  7 (or 8) floors, pretty much every type of service you could look for....smoothie bar, dietician, towel service etc.   They keep things fun and interesting with unique classes ..so since I get bored easily this is the main attraction for me! While I think some of the classes are a bit too jam packed, I do think the instructors do a nice job of motivating everyone and offering some individualized attention. I've really liked the pool facilities - and have even ventured into the hot-tub (scary at most gyms, but really is kept up here). I still recommend wearing flip-flops and showering beforeafter just in case. I'm totally with Nicole in that kiddies are cute and all but not when I am trying to work out- so I like that I know the pool has never been peed in!Overall as a few people mentioned this place isn't completely perfect - parking's a B and  I feel they could amp up the AC in Keith gym but overall it really has exceeded my expectations!

"I never knew I could love a gym so much! So if you look at this gym from the outside, it looks a bit outdated. Before I started going, I knew alot of people went there which perplexed me since it looks more like an office building from the 60's rather than a gym. But step on it and everything changes..... They have a beautiful lounge area that reminds me of a lounge area on a cruise ship. Tons of comfy seats, windows and free wi fi too! Free wifi at the gym Yes, I totally go to the YMCA to get my wi fi on. They also have a cafeteria-esque food joint. I can do that because of the spacious locker rooms they have. They have lockers you can rent out on the monthly or bring your own lock and use one of the daily use ones. In the women's locker room they have the standard showers, whirlpool, sauna, steam room but they also have a separate workout room down there complete with cardio machines, machines and free weights. Their showers are bigger than the ones at my house which is pretty small so I can go workout, shower, dry my hair, go to the lounge and ""lounge"" with free wifi for a couple of hours. Oh yeah, I guess I should talk about the actual gym component eh I've been to different Y's in Charlotte and Y's in other cities and the Dowd has the most recent models of treadmills, ellipticals and weight machines I've seen. For people without cable (like me) they have tons of machines with tv's, hooray!! Yeah, it gets busy in the morning or right after work but they are open until 10pm on weeknights so there is more than enough time to go!
",1
"Join this gym!  I've just moved to Chicago and I miss the Dowd Y so much!  This gym is always clean, there are always employees of some sort nearby doing their job of assistance or cleaning.  Their is plenty of equipment, but peak times can exhaust what's available.  I don't care, I like a busy gym.  Empty ones are dull and boring.Be sure to attend athletic conditioning classes conducted by Becky (if you're advanced) and Roy ( if you're not yet advanced).  They're fantastic and worth the time, you may have to crawl to your car the first time.  Also take yoga from Jonathan or Mary.  All the instructors are very good, but these are my favorites.  I miss you guys!

"First of all, this place is phenomenal.  I have a membership to the Morrison (close to work), but decided to come try out Dowd on the weekend since it's so close to my house.I walked in and asked where the cardio machines are.  The staff member behind the counter let me know that they have a few cardio machines in the Women's locker room and the rest were on the next floor.  I walked into the locker room just to check out the machines (imagining a treadmill next to the shower) and was SHOCKED.  And I really do mean I was floored.  The Women's locker room has to be about 2,000 sq ft!  It's enormous!  There is basically a Women's gym inside the locker room!  I fell in love.  Lockers, a Jacuzzi, showers, mirrors to get ready, hair dryers, a cardio room, changing rooms, weight machines, yoga mats, a tv, and more!  Holy crap, did I just die and go too gym-heaven!Needless to say I didn't actually make it out of the Women's locker room to see the rest of the building.  In my defense, I didn't really need to.  They had everything I needed right there!  What a wonderful place!  I will definitely be back!
",1
"First of all, the last thing I would do is rate a gym poorly for being crowded. It's obvious right away that the Dowd is a VERY popular place - for good reason. Although parking came be very limited, arriving with that expectation makes coming here at 5:30pm every other day much easier to swallow. This gym is flat out awesome. Many different rooms, great free weight area, great nautilus section, hybrid machine section, etc.But, the best part about the Dowd, for me, is the lengthy class schedule. Every day of the week, many throughout the day, and very accommodating to different sections of the body. Spin classes are awesome, just make sure to sign up for a bike early - they will and always do fill up. Convenient location on Morehead, close to many other parks in the area, and pretty easy to get in and out of. Overall, I love it here and couldn't recommend it enough!

"I recently visited this facility visiting Charlotte, NC. One note, I'm not sure why they have this 301 S. College st. address unless it's for mailing purposes only, because they is nothing that a new, unfamiliar visitor can use knowing this address that will help you find this Bat Cave. The address on the outside of the building says something TOTALLY different, and unrelated to '301' 'College' or 'St'. But, after calling the staff help me via telephone to find their location. I was very impressed with the facility and its cleanliness. All cardio equipment has there own cleaning spray and towels, which is very convenient, in that you don't have to walk all around trying to find out where the cleaning materials are located. I also took the Body Pump class with Sue M. and another young lady. The class was great and I'd suggest others to take it as well.Also, I got a chance to watch the Zumba class (instructor by Ms. B (*I can't remember her name at the moment))..but it looked very entertaining to say the least.Great job to the staff I'll definitely recommend this facility and will consider returning to it on my next Charlotte, NC visit.

"I was staying at the Hilton next door and got access to the YMCA.  Nice!  One of the days, I woke up with a sore throat.  Headed to the gym anyways, but started coughing horribly just as I checked in.  Had to walk out to clear my throat then went back in and hopped on an elliptical machine.  The lady at the front desk was so nice!  She brought me a cup of water because she noticed that I was coughing so much earlier.  Amazing service!  Now I wish I belonged to a YMCA back home.  Going to have to look into it for sure.
",1
"I prefer CK YMCA to Dowd during the week. For one thing, it's less crowded. I also feel that people are a bit more ""real"" at CK... I don't feel underdressed when I'm working out and people actually talk to you -whereas at Dowd I feel a bit inferior because I don't own any Lululemon & I actually take my makeup off before working out. Don't get me wrong, there are some great people at Dowd & you'll find me there most Sundays -but for a middle class person that works in uptown, I find CK way more welcoming & a better workout environment than Dowd during the work week.

"I came to Madison and tried out this club.  VERY  NICE for the individual price.  A warm pool, lap pool, two hot tubs, cardioweight room upstairs, weight room downstairs, raquetball courts, you name it.

"Harbor Athletic Club is great.  We use it all the time - swimming classes for the boys and yoga, pilates, and cardio classes for my wife.  No classes for me, but I still enjoy the club.Membership dues are right in line with other major clubs in the area.Highly recommended!

"Look, I love this place and I don't want you to join. It's the antithesis of the meat market known as Princeton club. Sadly, smoothie barcafe is gone. Harbor is a really laid back health club that has everything that I need and more. The only downfalls are that it's super old and kind of put together like a corn maze.8 years and counting!

"Member here for 10 years total--  I love clean! I love being able to walk away from noisy kids and go into another pool since i am a swimmer I like choices. Cool people -- members keep to themselves dont try to interfere with your workout with chit chat  I LOVE THIS !! We are busy working out no talking needed ! Great classes!  Great equipment and you can use other clubs too with their membership win win But umm yeah don't join K It is hard enough to find parking as it is !I went astray for a bit I will admit tried the Princeton Club to see what I was missing out on all the hoopla. What I found was old band aides that did not seem to move for days left around the pool and inches of standing water where you are supposed to wring out your suit NASTY !!I found my way back and like the Prodigal son who returns home after making mistakes I am back and I am happy!!

"I have the utmost respect for Dr. Teng . He is truly the most caring and competent physician I have ever seen. Always on call and never too busy to take charge at anytime ND. He got me through a very difficult time and I know if I needed him right now he would be at the other end of the phone or meeting me at the hospital. He is a man with a true commitment to his profession and the finest Dr. and gentlemen I have ever met. His brother works hand in hand with as his antheisologist and also a true professional. Office staff caring, competent, and always ready to make things work. As you can see I wish I could go to him for everything that was in need of attention. I wish him and all his staff the best always and look forward  to my follow up visit in a couple of months. one other point of information. Always has a can do and wonderful attitude.

"Dr Teng completed Para esophageal Hiatal Hernia surgery on me in September 2014. I chose Him because he has extensive experience as a General Surgeon. He lived up to His positive surgical reputation. With any surgery there are risks and not everything is always perfect. With that said, I have had minimal side effects to this point, 2 months later.

"Dr. Teng is a great surgeon. I was recommended by my oncology doctor. I went to Dr. Teng during March of 2014 to get my Power Port removed. A week later, I went to Summerlin Hospital and had my surgery with Dr. Teng. After half an hour or so, he got my Power Port out safely. Dr. Teng is very quick and cares for his patients. Would recommend if anyone needs surgery.

"I am giving this review 5 stars partly on a leap of faith because it is still a developing business.  But so far, I like what I see and I see myself being a regular here.I was familiar with Neos because of the funny radio commercials I heard on KissFM while driving to work.  I now have Sirius because the repeated Shane Company diamond commercials where causing me to bang my head into the dash board so often that it was creating a large dent.  But the Neos commercials were short, witty and appreciated.  However - this is the not the same Neos that you may be familiar with. This new Neos Medspa is under new ownership and management.  I was a little surprised with the small size of the new medspa, but I was also a little relieved.  I was always hesitant about certain procedures because you have to leave most of your modesty at the door and I am a rather modest person.  But the small staff (who are also the owners), and homely office, felt warming and welcoming.  It was definitely less intimidating than other medspas I have considered in the past.Neos was very honest and straightforward with me, they did not try to sell me any product or convince me I needed anything extra. I am easily influenced when it comes to buying things, so this is something appreciated more so by my husband.Since I have Sirius, I don't know if the new Neos Medspa has radio commercials or if they will have the same comical flair, but as long as Tom Shane is not involved, it won't be the most annoying thing on the radio.  If he is involved, I will be doing a review update.

"I started going to Rejuvena since 2007, and regret that I have not wrote a review sooner. It was called something else at the time, but they still have the same WONDERFUL staff. I don't even use a primary care physician anymore, because I trust Dr. Jain with all of my medical concerns. Intentionally, I began going there for laser tattoo & hair removal, and eventually kept going for IV Nutrient & Detoxification Therapy. I have referred Dr. Jain to several friends who also see him regularly now. I believe in his practices so much that I even did a segment on Fox10 News. You can view the interview at this link: http:www.youtube.comwatchfeature=player_embedded&v=3XPy8Vv6y1Q I cannot go without mentioning the women of his office either. I have booked organic facials just so I could visit with Kimberly, who was my laser technician, and who I now consider a friend. Sadly, I have moved from Arizona, but I will go back to Scottsdale for work. I will most certainly schedule office visits during those times.

"This is the most reliable car service I have experienced in Pittsburgh. Amazing service. For the last four years, we have used them each week to pick up and drop off colleagues at the airport. They're always waiting by the Hertz counter, ahead of time, without fail. Even when the flight is early or had a 3 hour delay. They charge about $10 more than a yellow cab. If you have client you need picked up or dropped off at the airport, I would highly recommend First Class. My first time in Pittsburgh, when the driver heard I was on an interview, he even gave me a free tour of a few neighborhoods in the city.

"I agree with the other reviewers. I tried these guys based on the Yelp reviews and was not disappointed.

I was nervous about using one of the standard cab companies because their track record of actually showing up isn't great.

If you're planning on getting a cab to the airport, definitely use First Class.

"After reading glowing reviews on Yelp, I decided to try this service to pick up my 83 year old mother and take her to the airport. Service was great. Driver was very courteous and on time.

"Fabulous service all around. My husband was coming in on a redeye flight from San Diego around 9am on Saturday morning, and just before midnight on Friday, I realized I wasn't going to be able to pick him up. I called First Class Limousine Service around 12:30am and was pleasantly surprised that someone picked up. I ended up speaking to Dave, the owner, and he was able to accommodate my last-minute request. My husband initially went to the wrong meeting place (on account of his sleep deprivation :) so the company called me asap when he didn't show up right away--I reminded hubby about the correct meeting spot and all went well after that. He was very happy with the service and the price. I'd definitely use this company again for rides to and from the airport! Thanks everyone!

"I moved to Pgh from San Francisco in 2010, and every single dealing I've had with AAA since I moved here has been great -- straightforward, super helpful people, and mostly quite brief wait times. The agent that I have worked with from the start, whose name I think is Heather (long dark hair, second desk from the left), has always been willing to spend as much time with me as I needed to understand what I was buying andor the process that I needed to go through.Also, my car was totaled a couple of years ago (some jagoff who was texting rear-ended me, ahem, please don't do this), and they were phenomenal. I had a check for the full amount in less than a week.I see a lot of negative reviews here for services that are title related. I don't know if those people are even AAA employees, they might be DOT for all we know. I've had three title transactions, including one for a car that was from out of state, and they all went smoothly. I've been with AAA for more than 40 years, and when I lived in California I was seriously considering switching. Not anymore.

"My husband and I stayed here for a weekend getaway. What a neat place! It's a european style hotel (read very nice but smaller rooms). It used to be a monestary back in the day.

All of that for only $135 a night! A short ride from everything. Includes free parking.

"I was so lucky to stumble upon the Priory! I came to Pittsburgh for a conference. The Westin at the convention center was booked, so I had to find alternative lodging and came across this place. I love this hotel.  The historic building is beautiful.  The beds are comfortable. The staff are very friendly and helpful.  They have a wonderful free continental breakfast in the morning.  It's near bars and restaurants, a nail salon, and a grocery store (I was surprised to find that beer is not sold in grocery stores in Pennsylvania.  Luckily, you can buy a variety of chilled beers at the front desk, which is open 24 hrs). The local pizza place delivers until 2 am.  It's walking distance to the Andy Warhol Museum.  Also, it's only a 2 minute drive from the convention center and much cheaper than the Westin.  I paid $105night. The tv was very small and the water pressure was weak, but everything else exceeded my expectations.

"One thing Pittsburgh is not known for, but should be, is turning old churches into businesses, homes and even bars (gasp!).  Most of the churches are so beautiful that it's such a great use of space.  This is no exception, as it's just so unique inside! If you're looking for that nontraditional hotel that's NOT a Marriott or Hilton, this is the place you'll want to stay!  It's fashioned like a European boutique hotel, plus all the amenities you'd be looking for like WiFi, a shuttle and continental breakfast (score!). It's also a really lovely place to have an event.  For smaller events you can rent out specific parlor's for a reasonable cost and you're able to bring in your own caterers.  I really like this option because you're not boxed into one choice that may be out of price range.  If I would have gotten married in Pittsburgh, this would  definitely have been my first choice for the reception.  The Grand Hall is just gorgeous!  It has the original church organ and stain glass windows.  When it's all dressed up for the event it's just a stunning place for a magical affair! The Northside of town, where it's located, has walkable access to the Andy Warhol Museum, The Mattress Factory Museum, The Children's Museum, The National Aviary, The Carnegie Science Center, PNC Park (home to the Pirates, go bucks!) and Heinz Field (home to the Stillerz, as we call them in the burgh).  Some are farther than others, but there's always the shuttle if it's in our frigid winter season.  In the summer, go for the walk so you can take in the sights!There's also a lot of cute restaurants and bars on East Ohio River Boulevard, which is two streets up from the hotel.  My suggestions would be Bistro to Go and Bistro Soul, Rita's Italian Ice (personal fave) or The Priory Bakery for dessert!  There's also Legends North Shore not far on E. North Ave. about two streets up from E. Ohio and Amani Coffee Shop and Cafe for a quick stop for coffee or a great panini for lunch.   It's really a fantastic time to go in the summer because EVERYTHING is within walking distance.  Plus they have a great farmers market in the park right along E. Ohio and they have kayaking in the park right by the Aviary.  The big kayaking organization, Venture Outdoors is right under the 6th St. Bridge next to PNC Park.  You're able to kayak around the three rivers for only $15 an hour!  It's a great way to see the city!This is your place for one unique stay, I wouldn't steer you wrong!

A great place to escape after a long drive or a stressful drive around the maze of roads and traffic that make up Pittsburgh.Each room is pretty unique and always well appointed and very clean. The staff are friendly and helpful with whatever you might need and it's an easy drive to most of the attractions around town.

"Stayed here for several days during a very rainy time. The hotel is great, very charming, and fun to stay at. Definitely not your typical chain hotel, as it's an old-style mansion.The continental breakfast was delicious, the hotel staff was very friendly and helpful, the amenities were wonderful (fast wifi!!). Like others said, it felt more like you were part of a fun community due to the interactions with the staff, the small great bar downstairs, and the welcoming atmosphere. The fitness center was well equipped as well, and there was a great complimentary shuttle. The driver would not only take us to restaurants, but would suggest other cool places to visit. Overall I could not recommend this more. The only ""negative"" is the area where it is doesn't have many other fun places - but they ARE a short drive away.

"I'm saying this is as good as it gets. If you're a visitor coming for a Steelers game, that doesn't need 5 star accommodations, then I HIGHLY recommend checking this place out. Two words: FREE SHUTTLE. Hell yes, free shuttle to and from the Pittsburgh Steelers game(downtown Pittsburgh Hilton, about 1 mile away). Free shuttle to and from the airport. Complimentary managers happy hour (two free drinks per person). Complementary Internet and parking. Breakfast buffet in the morning. Seriously, as a tourist on my first trip to Pittsburgh for a Steelers game this hotel made everything way to damn easy. It isn't 5 stars for it's glitz and glamour, however the rooms are clean and I cannot stress how tremendously friendly the staff is. It isn't exactly close to the downtown area, but like I said- free shuttles will take you there and pick you up. I can't recommend this place enough for it's 'value to complimentary services' ratio. Made my trip to Pittsburgh a breeze.

Only stayed for one night, but wouldn't have minded staying for more.Oh yeah, complimentary breakfast (which I didn't wake up for), happy hour (which I wasn't in the hotel for) and indoor heated pool (which I didn't get to go in).p.s. tip the shuttle driver, people.

"This is one of my favorite bars in Pittsburgh. It's a bit edgier than most of the others bars in the area, which also gives it a lot more character. This place is one of the closest things that reminds me of an urban-artsy feel that I'm used to in Southern CA. Shadow supports local artists and has weekly open mics. Only downside is I'm not used to paying a cover for open-mic sessions, but I understand an establishment needs to raise some dough. The drinks are decent and there are many local and big artists that come here for shows. Always good vibes at Shadow!

"Dear Shadow Lounge, I miss you. You're wonderful in every way. The dance parties, the live music, the poetry slams, the local art, the totally reasonable drink prices, the cute and chill proprietor eye candy...I could go on. Stay awesome. Xoxo,Andrea

"As a Brooklyn based live indie-electronichiphop performer that travels, Shadow Lounge is by far one of my all time favorites.  As a Pittsburgh native remembering it's first opening when it was just bboys, graff heads, MC's and DJ's doing their local thing, it's amazing to see this place has become so professional, original, and really stands-out and is positively active for the community and continuing growth of Pittsburgh.  The service is delightful on both sides (AVAShadow Lounge), the prices are just right, the sound system is a complete BANGER with crisp and clean sound.   The crowd is mad cool and always responsive to good music.  Shadow Lounge really holds it down for Pittsburgh's scenes no matter the genre.  Can't visit Pittsburgh without stopping by Shadow Lounge.

"I'm a newbie in Pittsburgh and have lived in California almost all of my life. Most recently I was living in the San Francisco Bay Area where dope lounges, clubs, cafes are bountiful. Ever since the first time I stepped foot in Shadow Lounge a sense of familiarity and peace overwhelmed me. Gotta give it up to the owner, Justin, for creating such a unique and welcoming venue in Pittsburgh, I can honestly say that both Shadow and Ava Lounge have become one of my new favorite kick it spots hands down!

"Loved everything from the ownership, to the crowd, to the live music. LOVED how everyone seemed to actually be dancing, and not just standing and staring on the side lines. Did I mention that it was a live 10 person salsa band Yes, yet another oxymoron: salsa and snow... Again.. Only in Pittsburgh!

"Went several nights in a row: Thursday, Saturday & Sunday. I cannot say enough how much I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!!! Every night was different: African night, Latin Dance, Brass Band (that was amazing). The Ownership is way friendly & open to chatting which I love. The bartenders are open, friendly & genuine...anyone who remembers my name & my drink is a winner in my book! It shows they are listening when they actually ask you a question! The ownership was willing to allow us to order & set on fire a Flaming Dr. Pepper.....had to bring a little Southern treasure North! ;)I love the diverse, yet open and friendly crowd each night. I felt right at home.Now for the real surprise....THE FOOD!!!We ordered the~Tortas 7.00...we got one Chicken & one Steak..both were perfect!Sandwiches with your choice of tofu or breaded chicken.  Served on toasted bread or multi-grain wrap with melted mozzarella cheese, fried bean spread, avocados, tomatoes, and onions. Topped with a chipotle sauceCheese Steak Torta 9.00Grilled steak served on toasted bread or multi-grain wrap with onions, peppers, mozzarella cheese, fried bean spread, topped with guacamole and chipotle sauceI was shocked & amazed at how wonderful this ""bar food"" was. The tortas were great & the guacamole homemade. I will be back every time I am in Pittsburgh!

"On Tuesday nights, they have open mic. On my birthday (4-12), I went here to check off another life list item...SPOKEN WORD! I did it! The crowd was open & welcoming to all that performed. There are some awesome artists in Pittsburgh! Also for $5.00, I got a basket of tortilla chips and 3 homemade dips: guacamole, black bean and a verde salsa...all were delicious & for $5.00 it was A LOT!

"My girlfriends and I (the Girl Posse) were looking for something to do on a Saturday Night.  Being that we're all married 30-something(some with kids) music fans, we don't always get a chance to get together and head out to a show.  But somehow the planets were aligned and the whole bunch went out to Moondog's for some great live music.This is another one of those places in which I can't believe I'm the first to review.  Moondog's is a local institution, people!  It's been around here ever since I can remember.  Rusted Root played here in their pre-""Send Me On My Way"" days.It's everything you want in a small music venue.  Although does mean a slightly cramped seating area and the requisite long lines for the restrooms, it's a great intimate venue to see live music.  And Moondog's brings in the music!  It has everything from rock to blues to folk music.  The Starlite Lounge Restaurant is next door and you can order food from there and bring it into the club.  It's local music folks.  Come out and support it!

"Love this place. Very 1920's cinema feel to it.  Not row seating, but cinema seating.  Think Vegas lounge lizards...with an area for front row standups about 6 people deep. Be sure to check out ""The Noises 10"" here. A great local band that seems to place here 6-8 times a year.
",1
"I have been to the Visulite Theatre once to see the John Scofield Band.  I was not sure what to expect especially since I went by myself.   It was  a very enjoyable experience.  I ended sitting by the railing above the standing area in front of the band.  John Scofield is great and the jam band he tours with is fun to watch.  I always meant to go back but it never happened.
",1
"If I could see a show at the Visulite Theater every time I come to Charlotte I would. I'm not sure how long the theater has been around - but I grew up here in Charlotte and never knew about it until about two years ago, when I went and saw the North Mississippi Allstars - awesome show. I'm home for  the holidays right now and I just saw  Acoustic Syndicate, also a great show! Fantastic sound and a huge - and very accessable - bar. No smoking (or at least the night I was there), but there's a back area when smokers can go. Overall a really cool spot, I'm so happy that Charlotte's got a good music venue- woo hoo!
",1
"I get warm fuzzies just thinking about the Visulite.  It's cool, laid-back, and almost feels like you have stepped into a time warp....like some sort of dimly lit lounge from the '50's.  The first place I ever saw a concert in Charlotte and I was hooked.  The prices are standard bar, slightly overpriced with teeny tiny cups for mixed drinks.  But, if the band you are seeing rocks, then it's all good.  Sounds quality is excellent and can be LOUD!!!
",1
"Best venue in town to see a show.  Over the years, I've seen Galactic, Medeski Martin & Wood, Soulive, Victor Wooten, and many others.  Can get a bit tight, but that's the price you have to pay to see live music in Charlotte.
",1
"I need to come here again soon, it is a really dark, tight atmosphere where you can get up close and personal with the acts.  The employees are very into the music as well, which is always a plus.  I hate going to really mainstream venues where the security and bartenders just blankly stare at the guests.  These guys are nodding along to the tunes and thoroughly feeling the grooves.  Someone told me that this place used to be a porn studio back in the 70's, this may be one of those city myths, but it looks like it could have been.  It would be pretty rock and roll if that were the case.  Anyways, I am a huge fan of the Visulite.
",1
"I've been going to the Visulite since it opened.  It's my favorite live music venue in Charlotte.  So many great bands have hit this stage.  Most of the staff have worked here since the beginning.  Great atmosphere.  Many wonderful memories!

"Cool spot, great music

"I'll keep it short: Awesome atmosphere, inexpensive drinks, cheap tickets to see great live music. All around a cool venue and a great time. I can't wait to go back!

"As far as live music venues go in Charlotte, this is my favorite and I've been to pretty much all of them.  It's not a big venue, but they get some decent acts for my music taste (JamFunkElectronica).Cover charges are usually around $10-15, extremely cheap (Obviously also depends on the artist....).  They also have both beer and liquor.  It's nice to have the option, some nights I just want to let it all out.  The beer selection is good as they have about 10-12 taps with local NC brews and the likes of Magic Hat, Sweetwater, New Belgium, etc.  They also have a good bottle selection for the stuff that's a little more rare.  Drinks are normal, reasonable prices.As far as the musiclayout is concerned, there really isn't a bad spot in the place.  It's multi-tiered, so lots of areas with a good view.  The barentrance is at the top, then it drops down to an open area with the sound board and cocktail tables (it's nice to have the option to sit and enjoy the music), and then drops down again to a pit area that's standing room only in front of the stage.  The stage is the height of the 2nd level with the cocktail tables, so that's usually where I'm at, but people are always getting down in the pit.  All in all, the layout of the place is why I like it so much.  The sound is great too.  You can't have a great music venue without great acoustics!  I always look forward to a show here.
",1
"Great Jazz and they even let people stand in.  Some high schooler was amazing on the harmonica.  As a big Slim Harpo fan I was very impressed.  The scene wasn't smoky at all.  Very nice although the crowd was small.
",1
"I wish I had made it out to this place on my last trip to Charlotte. Pretty much all of the other music venues I wanted to visit reserve their acts for Friday and Saturday nights (especially on a holiday weekend like Thanksgiving). However, I'm more of a middle-of-the-week music appreciator. For other Monday night music lovers, this is an excellent place to take a visitor for some straight ahead jazz and blues. I used to love standing in line in the cold to see jazz played the way its meant to be played, in a smoky basement with singers and musicians jumping on the mic at completely unscheduled times, at a little club called Small's in Manhattan's West Village. And the ability to enjoy some of the best Rockabilly, Country, and Blues musicians around (for FREE!) at Rodeo Bar in Manhattan's Murray Hill any night of the week, has also spoiled me.My point being - places like Small's, Rodeo Bar, and Double Door Inn are a dying breed. It is your duty as a live music supporter to exercise your right to enjoy this craft in a setting that is up close and personal, and velvet-rope-free. Though I doubt that the Double Door can draw New York sized crowds on a ""school night"", if you bring a group of friends here now, it could quickly become your own private corner of musical heaven for years to come.
",1
"One of the best places in Charlotte for continual live music. Open since the mid-70s the Double Door inn has hosted a ton of top acts and is always full of people who love music. Charlotte isn't known nationally for its music scene but with venues like this, it is hard to deny that you can't have a great time with Charlotte music. Decent beer selection and regular visits from the legendary Bill Hanna (at least legendary for Double Door Inn visitors) solidify the Inn as a location for musical bliss any night of the week.
",1
"My dad was a bouncer here in the 70's and my first visit was with the old man. I couldn't imagine any better venue in Charlotte. They even had a live band on Christmas night the last time I was in town. Can't say enough, so I'll leave it at that.
",1
"A true Charlotte staple!  My bf works for a blues music agency in the city, so coming here often is a pre-requisite for us.  This venue has been around forever and you can really tell....it's oozing with history from the pictures on the walls to the original bar.  There is always something going on at the Double Door, every night of the week and many, many famous faces have graced their stage including slow hand himself, Eric Clapton.  The bartenders are friendly, will gladly serve you PBR in a can, and may even ring the bell up front for a good tip.  Oh and you can buy scratchers tickets at the bar if you are bored with the band.  :)

"Pretty much the spot for local blues.  Diverse music line-up so you may want to check the website.  Clapton played there!

"Hey there everyone!  This is John, the Production ManagerSound Engineer at the Double Door Inn.  Just happened across our venue here on Yelp! and was extremely honored to see so many people saying such nice things about our room!  Thanks so much to all of you for coming out and enjoying live music with us.  Its something we LOVE and we're lucky to be able to share it with you!  As Sabrina mentioned in her review, its up to us to support live music and the venues that offer it to you.  I'll go ahead and step out on a limb by offering a big thank you from all of the Double Door staff for the support that music fans have given the club over the past 36 years.  Looking forward to hopefully seeing all of you again and offering you many more years of great live music!!!!!

"Always a happy diverse crowd, especially on a Monday night. Great music. NC's oldest Blue's Club. GO ON MONDAY NIGHT!

"No better place to listen to live music in Charlotte than the DDI...a historic and very intimate venue recognized as the ""Oldest Live Music Venue East of the Mississippi"" and holds the title ""Oldest Blues Club In The U.S. Under Original Ownership"".  Legendary performers like Eric Clapton, Stevie Ray Vaughn, Buddy Guy, Junior Brown, and  many others have graced their stage.  Amazing local talent too pretty much any night of the week.  Diverse and casual crowd.  And now that the place is completely smoke free, you won't leave smelling like an ashtray!!!  The Double Door Inn is definitely a hidden treasure in Charlotte.  Get out and support live music and the venues like this that offer it to you!!  You'll defnitely get your money's worth!

"This was another Charlotte Institution I'd never heard of until I moved back to town as an adult.  Growing up in the soulless suburbs and listening to Nickleback, I never really crossed paths with The Milestone.Oh, but it's lovely.  There is always something to be said for a divey music bar (every town should have one), where you know PBR will always be the cheapest drink at the bar, where you still leave with smoke lingering on your sweatshirt, and where you know everyone's just out to have a good time.
",1
"Bust out the grunge. The Milestone is the perfect place to schmooze with the punks, metalheads and venueshow rats. Crawling with history, and plenty of stickers on every surface from showsbands of the past, this hole-in-the-wall turned landmark is one my favorite venues in the QC. I've been here on multiple occasions and each time has been different and more memorable than the last. My first impression, a while back, was a little disheartening from how many people were smoking inside. Now, so I hear, this has been done away with. Good for us non-smokers and maybe a blow to the cigarette-goers. However, this paled to the happiness I found in the small bar with cheap PBR and the even tinier stage. I've seen this stage packed with 6 member outfits with hardly enough room to play and smaller rockabilly bands tearing it up! So much personality there could be a novella written about the days it has seen. Goodness what a cool joint. This place isn't glamorous, folks. It's an old, converted house, turned-venue. If you're into punk, metal, or anything in between, check their website. Always booking shows and plenty of variety. You can buy tickets online or pay at the door. Beware on rainy nights. The parking lot, if you can call it a parking lot haha, gets really muddy. Park on the street to avoid a muddy car! Or, be awesome and park in the mud and make it a story! Cheers to the Milestone and many years to come of kicking some serious rock ass!

"I don't know about nirvana but I'm pretty sure I saw black flag their it looked like a small house the stage was just a raised board so called punks slam danced one dressed like a doctor afterwards the band just walked off the stage and drank with the crowd.

"Great location, best to go with nice weather because the atmosphere is all about being outside.Never a better time to go get a bottle of wine, relax outside in the nice weather, and listen to some music or catch up with friends.  Wine in all categories, under 20, over 50, take your pick because there is something there for you.If you're not in the mood for wine, don't be scared - there's a pretty nice beer selection as well.  For only 4 refrigerators they fit a lot of options inside.
",1
"It's really a shame people in Charlotte don't use Yelp very much yet, because this place definitely deserves its props as the best wine bar  shop in the area. No matter what you're interested in, if you want to have a drink the guys and girls here can help you find the perfect match for your palate. The wine selection is hard to beat, and you definitely won't find better deals anywhere else in Charlotte. The beer selection is also top notch, and they even do a yearly tasting outside with close to 100 beers to sample from.One of the best things about the Wine Vault, and something that really sets them apart from the other contenders in this genre, are their weekly tastings. For $5-10 (depending on the quality of the wines that week) you can taste up to 6 wines, and learn a little bit about each one while you do it. There's a large group of regulars who come to almost every tasting, so if you're new to the area it's also a great way to meet some really cool people. There's also an extensive wine cellar (hence the Vault name) downstairs with private bins that you can rent to store you own wine, in addition to a much larger seating area that I think most people don't even realize exists. They do lots of private events down in the main cellar room, so if you want to do a big corporate event like a private tasting it's a really cool atmosphere and something your friends or employees will remember for a long time.My favorite aspect though has to be the almost monthly wine dinners that the shop puts on in conjunction with some of the best restaurants in the Charlotte area. They are always extremely reasonable in price, especially when you compare it to similar offerings around town. Make sure you get on the mailing list, because you definitely want to sign up for these early before they get sold out!

"I can't believe I never reviewed this one before.  A very classy but casual spot in the university area.  Amazing wine and beer selection.  Good cheeses, live music, outdoor patio(where you can bring you dog).  All of this right by the lake.  These guys also schedule tastings and pairings at some local restaurants.  Ranging from (25-80)ish per person, it is well worth it.  I highly recommend this place for a casual after dinner date spot or a gathering of friends.
",1
"This is the gem of University City. It's laid back atmosphere hits you from the parking lot, with acoustic sounds and the tinkling of laughter and wine glasses. At least a dozen tables spill outside the doors, filled with patrons and their cherished pets on any warm evening. It's commonplace to have live music from the patio, but doesn't overpower the conversations or keep the dogs from lounging. The ambiance, especially with the views of the lake and paddle boats, allows you to shift your mind into thinking you're anywhere but a local hangout in the Piedmont of NC. The Vault itself has tiny quarters, but stocks some well-treasured and fresh names, both in wine and brews. Snacks are available, with a varied assortment of cheeses, pretzels and party mix. It's very simple to walk in, make your selections, then take to the register for purchase. The only problem you may find are long lines, so I wouldn't wait until the last minute for a drink or the bathroom. It's worth a drive from anywhere in the Charlotte area to see what the UCB has been keeping to itself. This place is equally impressive for the intimate conversation of a first date, relaxing with a group of friends after work, or bringing your dog for some appreciative petting from strangers. If you're single, the last one is especially fun.

"Great spot in University City, take your dog and enjoy an adult beverage next to the lake.

"I absolutely love this little hang out. This is the best place in the area (and among my top pics in the city) for a casual date with friends. The prices are reasonable, the live music is fun, and the dogs are cute. The atmosphere of the Wine Vault is always nice regardless of what you're looking for. If you're in the mood for a little revelry with whoever may be passing by, grab a table close to the center. If a little more room to breath and a little less volume is what you are after, just grab a table around the outer edges.I have to admit that this place doesn't come to mind too much during the winter; but every summer the Wine Vault manages to stay on my ever-changing list of places that I want to be.
",1
"I....am a wine snob. So having said that, I love this little wine boutique. Very comfortable and inviting interior. Comfortable patio area for nice days. A very good selection of wines from all price and taste ranges. Daily varied offerings of wine by the glass or you can hunt through their wine walls for a bottle of your choosing. A little chilled something available for the beer and bubbly drinkers. Great location and atmosphere.
",1
"Great wine list price not to bad either... Come during the evening enjoy a nice brezze off the pond while you sit outside and people watch...
",1
"I cannot believe there are not over 100 reviews for this place raving about how it's such an awesome hang out.  Whenever I'm looking for a place to hang out with my friends and catch up, the wine vault always comes to mind FIRST.  It's usually difficult to catch an open table, but once you do, it's worth it.  You can buy a bottle of wine or a good beer and sit & sip outside (or inside) until your heart is content.  They do have a good selection of wine & beer, so you're not always (forced to be) drinking the same thing.**Another bonus: Dog FriendlinessIf you have a dog, heshe is welcome to hang out amongst the peoples.  Odds are that there will be at least half a dozen other poochies looking to mingle just like their owners.  **Something I'd like to see wine vault do:  set up easy recycling
",1
"Super cool! We happened upon the wine vault while in Charlotte apartment hunting. Coming from Jacksonville, FL, we've never seen anything quite like this. You just go in, pick a wine and find a table to settle in and relax. Its a good, inexpensive way to try new wines.We'll be regulars after moving to Charlotte!

"The Inferno plays goth, industrial, etc music.  Great place to go and dance, and there's plenty of eye candy.  Wednesday nights are nice and small, and Leather and Lace is good if you like dancing around a lot of people.  Sabbat de Sade is fun for public BDSM. Sometimes there are cool live bands.
",1
"First time here was Leather and Lace night in Oct. 2009. Finally an adult place to have adult fun. Not a bunch of college kids goofing around and giggling like fetish night at The Cardinal. This was much more mature and so much fun! Everyone friendly. So many beautiful sexy people. Loved the guy in the mesh shirt, hee hee! Ended up getting quite naughty and I cannot wait to return. I thought it was much larger than I expected, with the dance floor in the front, the middle area bar, and then the whole area in the back with two more bars there.Finally I have a place to go play!Kissy

"The inferno is never disappointing! From seeing A23 a few years back to Aesthetic Perfection just recently. They have Ac, a great stage, a really quant sitting lounge area and 2 bars. The place is very stylish with great color scheme. The bartenders are very knowledgeable on drinks and friendly and quick. The prices are moderate for drinks. Easy to get to. Easy parking. It seemed very friendly and inviting both times. To bad the inferno isnt in my neighborhood! :)

"Decent cover charge, $8. Spacious. VERY good House music. No creepers. My girlfriend and I visited last night and we had a BLAST. Non-stop dancing for 2-hours because the music that THAT good and engaging; I had to force myself to take a break. I love to dance and to have a good time. We were both able to do this without being bothered by anyone and with enough space to do to so. We did not have drinks, so I can't offer any opinions on that. After a 4 hour drive from Chicago, on the same day, this was a GREAT place to end up on a whim. If you seek a clean good time with good music and lots of dancing, then the Inferno is the place to be. It was cozy. NB: No coat check, but it was not crowded so placing our coats on the seats and keeping an eye from the dance floor was not an issue. Happy dancing YAW!
",1
"I haven't been here too many times, but the place is great! It has a really nice atmosphere and looks a lot nicer than the clubs I've been to before. The floors weren't sticky and overall the place was actually really clean. I really wasn't expecting that especially since I went to one of the fetish nights. It's a lot smaller than I was expecting. I guess that's probably the difference between clubs in smaller cities and big cities. It's not that big of a deal to me, but I imagine they can't hold a really big crowd. The drinks are fairly strong and aren't too expensive. The bathrooms are very clean and well lit. The staff are all amazingly nice and friendly. I enjoyed taking a drink outside to the smoking area and chatting. The people I met were lovely and I'm excited to meet new people at future events!

"My favorite venue in CU.Affordable tickets.Excellent sound.Easy access to drinking with the bar wrapped around the ""center"" wall. And cheap drinks.Having been to venues all over the Midwest, I always find myself wanting to be at the Highdive for a show.  Especially considering a show or tour that would sell-out in Chicago might just reach capacity down in Champaign.How I miss it.
",1
"I've never been here for a show...well, let me clarify.I used to come here tons as an undergrad for various Asian parties, and I still come here most times I've visited as an undergrad.  Things usually devolve into a shit show.Which, honestly, is a good thing, and it's what I'm shooting for when I want to forget about the real world for a weekend.  Sure, it's off campus, but it does have a giant dance floorstage and some awesome people behind the bar. Last time I was here I just kept asking for either A) something awesome or B) something alcoholic.  Never was disappointed once.If anyone you know is planning a party at the HD, be sure to clear your schedule and hit it up. You won't regret it (and you might not remember it).

"My and my main yelper came from Indianapolis to watch Corb Lund play at The Highdive.  It's an intimate concert venuebar, and we had a great time.  Parking was a breeze, we found plenty of spaces on a Saturday night right in front of the venue.If you're coming to a show, get there early to snag seating.  We found great seats up in balcony, which had it's own bar.  Were the bar stools and benches comfortable  Hell no.  Not at all, but the awesome drink prices made up for the sore buns.  Maybe it's because I'm used to paying upwards of $8 for a mixed drink, but $4.50 Wild Turkey mixers made for a great night!  Service was quick, and I never had to wait around at the bar to get a drink which was nice.All in all, a great place to grab a cheap drink and listen to some live music.
",1
"Folks, this is your quintessential small town concert venue.  Great prices, great service, great music.  I came from way out of town for an act that I couldn't pass up: the Corb Lund Band.  Canadian Honky-Tonk at its finest!  What I like most was the vibes - this place has character.  You can tell the building is old, but from what it looks like, it is in great condition.  The mood lighting is red and dim and the decor has a 60s retro-modern twist.  I like it.  If it's open, try to grab a seat on the upstairs balcony, especially if seats are limited down below.  The view and sound is fantastic.Ticket prices are right on the mark - most shows that I saw are under $20, most well below that.  Corb was $15, and from the performance we got, I'd say it was well worth it.  What also blew me away was the drink prices, I got an above rail whiskey mixer for under $5.  Maybe I'm not used to small town prices, but this was an unexpected surprise.All towns would be so lucky to have a music venue like The Highdive.  I have to agree with Jess S. on her review; there are not many places like this in the Midwest, and surely not in Indy.  Keep booking the gigs, Highdive, I'll keep ordering Wild Turkey and Ginger Ales.

"I am rating the food aspect of Cowboy Monkey 5 stars, because you would be hard-pressed to find a better plate of nachos anywhere. For the Cowboy Nachos alone, which are a bed of chips topped with tomatoes, guacamole, white cheese sauce, jalapeno peppers, and cilantro chicken (optional), I would swim across the ocean to let this savory swell of heaven crash against my taste buds! The food here is excellent. Though it is on the pricey side, when the patio and kitchen are open during the warm months, it is worth celebrating. Sadly, Cowboy Monkey does not serve their tasty Tex-Mex fare during winter or early spring. They open just in time for EbertFest at the end of April. If you like Americanized Mexican food, do yourself a favor and check this place out.

"So you wonder, (as you wander) does Phoenix have any history that pre-dates 1911 What happened to all the old brick and western style buildings that housed, cotton, supplies, cactus jelly, or whatever Phoenix would have had stored in a warehouse in 1911  Well this is a place that has history (albeit, only 80 years or so, but hey we'll take it.) Coming from Boston, I yearn to have some kind of architectural history, buildings that have meaning, purpose,  character. I mean how many adobe style, clay shingled buildings can we have seriously So if your looking for cool atmosphere, a safe venue (well lite parking lots) and great music, check out the brick house. I saw Okkerivil River here, and the experience was great, and the venue is the perfect size for a small show. They serve a wide range of beer and drinks. (food too) My only complaint, it was pretty hot inside, but then again it's ALWAYS hot inside buildings here in September. Check it out, you won't be disappointed.

"I lived a good 4 blocks from La Feria during grad school and loved every second of it. Yes, Pamela's is downstairs and, if you can avoid drooling at the thought of chocolate chip banana pancakes, crepe style you can enjoy the best of peruvian food- pumpkin, peanut, and sweet savory tastes. You can get meat, vegetarian or a combo of both (which is always what I ended up with). Delish salad to accompany and bread to take those last swipes of sauce off your plate. Everything is great with an Inca Kola- and maybe even better with the Peruvian mirror you've been eying up on the wall.Oh, and they do TO GO, which saved me on my walk home from the bus!

"I really love this joint. It is small and casual. The menu changes regularly, and there is always a vegetarian option. I'm surprised it isn't more crowded because I can't really thing of a negative thing to say about the place. The salad is yummy, and I'm not even a salad person. I think my favorite dish here thus far has been the Peruvian corn. The atmosphere is cozy with a little shop in the front.

"This place has authentic peruvian food and tasty american style peruvian sandwiches.  Every day they have a choice of two or three vegetarian and two or three non vegetarian entrees.  They serve these with rice and side salad.  My favorites are pumpkin and potato stew and potato, cheese, and pea casserole.  They also make a great egg salad sandwich with guacamole.  The homemade sweet potato chips and alfajores (shortbread cookies filled with caramel sauce and dusted with powdered sugar) are must haves.

"This delicious Peruvian Restaurant is often overlooked due to its location over the wildly popular Pamela's restaurant.  For those who don't want to wait in line for Pamela's or those who are looking for a great bite to eat, LaFeria is the place for you.  All of the food I've tried there has been great.  Their daily specials are usually yummy and their empanadas and sandwiches are great.  I especially love their salad.  Turkey breast over a bed of greens with red onions, walnuts and gorgonzola cheese dress in a tasty vinegarette.  It's light, yet you wont leave hungry.  While you're there, check out the Peruvian arts and crafts  that are also for sale there.
",1
"I love this cozy little restaurant!  The $10 meal deal is especially great for indecisive diners like me, and it's always delicious.  I can't comment on how closely they adhere to Peruvian cuisine, because I've never had it before.  The shop is fun too, but I'd feel awkward browsing the art without intending to stay, so I only look around after I'm done eating.

"Lovely, refreshing food, though the menu gets a bit old. Perfect, unique salad dressing. Must try it!

"La Feria recently changed their menu, so I thought I'd post a review about their new system. They've replaced the rotating daily specials with a larger menu. The classics are still on the menu (like the delicious ropa vieja) but now it's expanded to include things like their cheese and potato stew. As you'd expect, everything is delicious. It's also worth noting that the service is quick and friendly and there's a whole section where you can shopperuse Peruvian folk art and goods while you wait for your food. What can I say I love La Feria.

"Pittsburgh is a funny city. There are fantastic high end restaurants (e.g. Tamari, Spoon, 9 on 9, 11, etc...), but not so many medium-to-low-end restaurants. Well, La Feria is the clear exception. For $15 (or less) you can have an amazing Peruvian meal. My wife and I are experimenting with vegetarianism (I know, we're missing out on a lot of yummy meals!), and La Feria is particularly great for us. They always have 2 veggie specials that are great. Last night I had this bean and pumpkin dish which was fantastic.The atmosphere is pretty laid back and the staff are friendly, so for a quick and tasty dinner, this is the place to go.

"Great peruvian!  Love their housemade salad dressing.   Wish that I could buy it!  Their shredded chicken dishes are always excellent.  Great lunch spot in Shadyside.  Lovely little import store attached.  A favorite!!

"I really wish there was some place like this closer to cleveland. A fair trade shop with a cafe type restaurant, I can dig it. Its located on the upstairs, peruvian art adorns the walls and is for sale, they also have some clothes and these beautiful blankets that I seriously want. I wasn't feeling too great so I just ordered the three empanada platter and split it with my boyfriend. I picked the eggcream cheesegreen onion, spicy apple, and beef empanadas. I wish I was hungrier because it was so tasty! Boyfriend got the ropa vieja and it came with a salad and rice... very very good. The girl that waited on us was super sweet too. Ending check was $25, not bad at all.
",1
"Terrific lunch spot!  Their cubano sandwiches are excellent...and always go with the fries...skinny, perfectly made fries.  Their Mojitos and Caipirinhas are the very best in town...dinner seemed a bit overpriced, but the food is still excellent.  The other nice part of Latorres is that its in the heart of downtown, so plan a nice dinner or happy hour before heading out to hit some more classic bars, pubs or clubs in Charlotte.
",1
"Yum yum yum!!! LaTorre's is one of my favorite lunch spots and I'd highly recommend it to anyone who hasn't been!  My personal fave is the Pollo Chipotle sandwich with skinny fries.  Their food is amazing and the prices aren't too bad either.I have a slight issue with LaTorre's and here it is:  Once upon a time, I asked for the Cubano sandwich but with NO mustard.  Well, Mr. Waiter kindly informed me that their sandwiches are pre-made and they are unable to alter them in any way.  Hmm...pre-made hot sandwiches that are deliciously devine  I'm a skeptic.  After asking around, I found an inside source that said that their sandwiches are NOT pre-made but the managerschefs say that so that they don't get overwhelmed with nit-picky custom orders by my fellow corporate cube monkeys during the lunch rush.  My point:  the next time you want your Cubano with no mustard or extra sauce, don't believe the hype and make them customize it for you!  By the way, my spy happens to be an employee so I know it's true.  All in all, this place is great.
",1
"The food is good, but to me, the desserts are what really make Latorre's special. They do this crazy thing with burned sugar that is magical.They have great lunch specials. It's a little pricey for just me, but it's just right for a business lunch with a client. It makes you look smart and sassy and quirky and fun.There's lots of vegetarian options, which is always a good thing. Everything is presented beautifully, which is always fun. Some of the food seems almost too pretty to eat. Salsa night is also a good time. The crowd is relaxed and willing to teach a dorky newbie like myself. I've honestly never had a bad time here, night or day. Charlotte needs more places with so much character.

"Tonight, I cheated on Eliana's with Guanaquito. I still feel a bit guilty, as I've been with Eliana's for years, but when Guanaquito does it better in almost every way, how can you fault me If you blink, you'll miss it- on McDowell, between the Gourmet House of Hong Kong and Arizona Endoscopy Services. You need to park in back, accessible from a driveway before you pass by the dully colored sign for Guanaquito.Like Eliana's, it's Salvadoran cuisine, but there are so many more options at Guanaquito. They serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and based on tonight's sampling, Hubby and I will be back often to work our way through the menu. I had the ensalada drink and Hubby had the Horchata, which the waitress patiently explained was different from Mexican Horchata. It sure was- maybe it was the morrow seed that made it so unique. For his entree, Hubby had the equivalent of the sampler platter- a tamale (again, quite different from a Mexican tamale- softer and creamier), 2 pastales (meat pies) and 2 pupusas (stuffed, grilled tortillas). Guanaquito had a far greater variety of pupusas than Elaina's, and they were every bit as good. The one that I had that was most unique was made with cheese and loroco plant (which to me had an asparagus-y taste). Definitely delicious. At both Salvadoran places, we were served a bowl of cabbage salad, but at Eliana's we had never been told how to eat it. Guanaquito's was far less astringent and we were instructed to eat it with our pupusas. I was skeptical at first, but became quickly hooked. It did not overwhelm the taste of the pupusas, and added a nice crunch and zing. The only thing I found that Eliana's did better than Guanaquito was the flan. Guanaquito's texture was off, but the flavor was acceptable.I suppose I'm willing to share my new love with all of you- but be forewarned- she's a saucy mistress you'll be compelled to visit again and again. Oh- and she's cheap, too. Hubby and I got out of there for $24 (and that includes the extras I got to round out my leftovers for lunch tomorrow!).

"I love the food here! I had some sort of delicious fried pancake stuffed with shredded meat & cheese. They were called Pupusas. I cant wait to go back  :P I'm seriously jonesing for some more of those meat pancakes.... I need more like now!
",1
"I love that this place is nearly unrecognizable from the street. And that you don't hear a word of english being spoken. You know you're in for good food at that point. I had papusas and a random sampler - and my favorite fried plantain with beans and sour cream. This was good - better than Eliana's yes - but both are pretty damn good. And i felt like this place was Phoenix - super seedy exterior, lots of espanol, and good food in a strip mall - Phoenix to a tee.
",1
"A Salvadorean friend recommended this place to us when she found out that we love papusas. I got  a massive plate of those crispy, delicious goodies and an even more massive cup of horchata, which could have been a meal in itself. Our server was super-friendly and patient--it took us forever to decide. We left stuffed and satisfied.
",1
"The pupusas, yes, the pupusas are great. The loroco with cheese has become our favorite, But this past week, I strayed from our standard and tried the gallina soup with braised chicken and salad. All I can say is, ""What the hell Where has this been my whole life"" The soup is magical. Huge chunks of carrot, potato, and zucchini, with some thin noodles, and a savory broth with some mint leaves. I quickly abandoned the rest of my entree in favor of finishing the huge bowl of magic. It was the best soup I've had since coming to Phoenix 13 years ago. Good thing Hubby got sick this weekend- it gave me an excuse to go back and get some more. Being magical, you know it has serious healing properties. Here's where I learned that the Sopa de Gallina is chicken soup without the chicken meat and the Sopa de Pollo is the same thing but with the meat. Two huge Styrofoam cups to go with lemon wedges and 4 hot and fresh tortillas cost less than $6.00. I was stunned. The owner said it costs more with meat. Believe me, you won't miss it. Who knew that magic was so cheap Hubby's fever is already down and he's feeling much better.

"I have never eaten El Salvadorean food before!  I was looking for something different and saw the reviews!  I called a friend from El Salvador and he suggested the Pupusas with cheese!  THEY WERE YUMMY!!!  Its my new favorite food!!!  I will be back!  Thanks!

"As good as it gets.  Thats a pretty good way of putting it! If your into Salvadoran Food or if you are not this is your place.  Located near 14th street and McDowell the building is near a chinese place in an old white building.  You have to park in the back and at first glance you may question yourself for choosing this place.  But it really is worth it.  Once you get inside the place is spotless.  Very well kept.  The menu's do explain what you are eating so no surprises.  I got the Carne Asada plate.  The steak  was perfectly grilled and seasoned.  It came with yellow rice, beans, a salad, and tortillas.  The tortillas were thick and grilled.  I also shared a bean and cheese papusa.  The papusa was awesome basicly a tortilla stuffed with beans and cheese.  You have to try it.  Our meal came with chips and salsa and a salvadorian slaw mixture to share.  The price was right and the staff is friendly food A++++++++Good for lunch if you work in the downtown area not too packed.
",1
"Been there twice now.  Great servers and the owner is a sweetheart.  I ate the Pechuga Asada and a pupusa Locoye(sp) this time.  The chicken was made right, great beans and rice, fresh avocado,  big portions and the salsa and chips are excellent.   I live two blocks from here and I need to wake the eff up and go here more.
",1
"I'm going to flat out say this before I start writing the review, my aunt makes the best pupusas.  Now with that being said this is a nice little hole in the wall.  The place is nice and clean.  The food is cheap and delicious.  The people are really friendly and the old man behind the register always seems to great me with a smile ( I think he is the owner).  Mind you pupusas are more filling then they look so don't over order.  I like the traditional queso con loroco.  The plantains are also delicious.

"I've been wanting to find a good Salvadorean place in Phoenix and this place is it!  We went there on a whim for dinner, along with three friends and everyone hands down loved the place.  Its clean, comfortable and charming;  the menu is varied, with foods from El Salvador, Mexico, the Caribbean and even a few american style items.  The service is friendly, helpful, and didn't try to hurry us up.  My husband had the steak and onions, and it was excellent. We all shared several pupusas, which everyone loved.  And shared a fried plantain with beans and cream and it was delicious!  My vegitarian friend had the Fried Yuca (wout the pork), and she loved it. My husband is puerto rican and is very picky about restaurants, and had been resistant to trying Salvadorean food for a while - but this is now one of his favorite new hole-in the walls in Phoenix. We will be going back often!

"I love, love, love Eliana's. I have been eating here for years and enjoy bringing people new to Salvadoran food. The interior is cheerfully decorated with colorful folk art, and the service is always swift and friendly. My favorite items on the menu are: 1) the pupusas, kind of a soft gordita-like exterior with a meat and veggie thick stew-like interior - outrageously good!; 2) the yucca frita, fried yucca plant (very starchy, like potatoes) with some deep fried chunks of pork and garnished with radishes and cucumbers; 3) the ensalada drink, a bright-yellow fruit beverage with finely chopped assorted fresh fruit- comes with a straw and a spoon; 4) the plantain with beans and sour cream, a dish I wasn't sure about at first because I am very picky about my banana-type foods, but it totally and unexpectedly works and is ridiculously delicious.Eliana's is so inexpensive and such a wonderful experience. Everyone can find something they'll like- low spiciness, but full of great flavors and textures.

"Delicious. Had papusas and some other things selected at random off of the menu. All delicious. Also shared their fried plantain with beans and sour cream. Heaven.This place is wonderful and delicious. And totally reasonably priced.

"OMGS you guys. This is a little diamond in the rough. Nice and cheap, with a modest, but DELICIOUS, menu. I share the combo platter with my BF and then usually get the chicken, which is so moist and tender and slathered in creme...And it comes with a little cup 'o chicken soup which is yum-sauce.Papusas.  Need I say more
",1
"Having passed this place more than once while driving around, I'd always wanted to stop by but never made it much of a priority. Well I stumbled across reviews here and due to the raving about the papusas I HAD to stop in.My partner in crime was kind enough to accompany me and as soon as we did we too joined the pupusa bandwagon, mmm pupusa bandwagon (drools). We had the appetiser sampler which is good to share but might leave you wanting the another pupusa. I'm a fan of the chicken soup you get, but just wish the serving size was slightly bigger.The appetizer comes with 3 different items and all are equally tastey (ref. pupusa). They also give you some cabbage salad and a tomato sauce to accompany the items, yum.My gf ordered the recommended chicken dish and lurved the hell out of it, I agreed and actually was wishing I'd gotten that instead of the Salvadorian marinated steak, which was good, but paled in comparison to the chicken.Sidenotes: Try the ensalada drink, it's a sweet fruit based drink that comes with slices of apple. Sort of reminds me of drinking a melted otter pop, which as far as I'm concerned is off the proverbial chain. Also served with appetiser and as a sidedish with the food was a bean soup which was good and great for dipping the tortillas in. Oh, and the tortillas are Salvadorian style meaning thick and sort of along the lines of a Mexican gordita, I could eat these for days.Pupusas (drools) ""give me a towel boy"" (drools)
",1
"Very Cute and Cozy Place! The Food was AMAZING! Seriously I have been thinking about it all day and whether my diet likes it or not I'll be returning very soon! I got the Appetizer Platter which came with a Pupusa, a chicken meat pie, a chicken tamale and beans. (see pics) Everything was wonderful and fresh and oh so Delicious! I would have to tell anyone who has never had this kind of food, do not be intimidated, go for it you won't be sorry, my particular meal wasn't spicy or greasy it was just the best thing I have tasted in weeks and it's definitely budget friendly!
",1
"A friend of mine told me of Eliana's because I was familiar with Salvadoran food from L.A. and lamented that I couldn't find a good place in Phoenix.  I was happily surprised to find the food as good as it was there.That was in 1998.  I come here every so often when I get a ""hankering"" for Pupusas and have become very familiar with the proprietor and his family.  AWESOME food, AWESOME service, AWESOME ambience!
",1
"OK, I'll start with a disclaimer, I absolutely adore the people that run this restaurant and have been going to their restaurant since I moved to Phoenix around '91 (two locations ago).However, I have taken countless people to try the food from my native country and EVERYONE has LOVED it.   From my vegetarian to foodie (or chowhound) friends have found something (usually more) that keeps them coming back. Many thank me for having introduce them to this jewel of a restaurant. My favorite is the Mojarra Frita becaus it brings back memories of growing up in beautiful El Salvador.  I recommend the Especial Combinacion de Eliana's for first time visitors -- it has a Salvadorean tamale wrapped in banana leaf and is moist like a mousse; the tradtional pupusa and a savory turnover called Pasteles ($6).  For a hearty meal, the I recommend the Bistec (beef)  or Pollo (chicken) dishes that come with salad, rice, beans and Salvadorean tortillas ($8.95)..After reading some of the reviews, I just liked to say, thank you for trying out this food but it is not Mexican food.  I can recommend some of those if you msg me

"We ate at Eliana's based on reviews we had read.  Since we had to be at Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport anyway, and, Eliana's was not far from the airport, we decided to have lunch.  It was wonderful and we highly recommend it.  Everyone was very friendly and the food was delicious.  There were 3 of us and we each had something different.  Every dish was fresh and flavorful.  The juice drinks (I wish I could remember the names) were very good.  We will definitely go back.
",1
"Love this place. Service is always excellent-- it's usually the owner that waits on you. The food is wonderfully flavorful without using a lot of spice. Natural flavors are what makes this place tick.I've eaten here many times, and my recommendation is that you just order every appetizer on the menu and forget the entrees. At least, the first time you go anyway... You'll want to try it all.Very good food!

"If you haven't been to this place - go! Seriously. It's amazing. It's the best little hole-in-a-rundown-strip-mall you can find. And it's cheap!Nestled between stores like Big Lots and some electronic place with Mexican ranchero music blasting, this tiny place is hidden in the corner. The owner is from El Salvador, so don't expect it to be Mexican food -- there are many similarities, but the dishes themselves are different.Walking in, you can smell the homemade pupusas -- seriously, it smells like the roadside stands along the bus routes in central America. It's amazing. There are only a couple waitresses, and I don't think they speak much English, but the menu is in pictures, as well as in Spanish and some English, so you should do just fine.Get the pupusas - they're like thick, hand-made tortillas stuffed with either pork, cheese and beans or, my favorite, cheese and loraco flower, which is some green and edible plant that tastes a bit like asparagus, to me. It's definitely the best one. These things come with salsa and some coleslaw (if they don't, just ask for the salsa) and are very filling!The other dishes are really good, too. For a low price, you can get an entire plate of things like meat with rice and beans - and this place doesn't skimp on the fixin's. They put slices of fresh tomatoes, avocado and all kinds of other stuff on the plates.I honestly LOVE it here. If you want to avoid the crowds, come at an off-hour... then you can just sit, relax and watch the telenovela on the TV in the corner. For dessert, pick up a piece of the cheese pie near the cash register.I can't recommend this place enough!

"after writing this review I was contacted by mangt wa very nice letter apolgizing for the mis communication  between the server and us  and explaining the dishes we ordered ..my mis conseption of the beef dish weggs my wife had.

"Initially I went to this place for the tamales which were recommended by a coworker who is from El Salvador. Someof the people in my office also said that they were amazing (and I trust their opinions).  So I went in looking forward to that and ended up ordering all the pupusas as well. I must say I'm not a big fan of the tamales, they are too moist for my taste. The banana leaves do give a great flavor though. The true stars are the pupusas, which I had never had before and have since become addicted too. I literally order at least 6 for myself every time I go now. They are asininely delicious!!! I grab a large bite of pupusa and some of the curtido (a kind of slaw-ish awesomeness) and just chow down. Beware the post-lunch coma though as eating that many will knock the average person on their ass. This brings me to my one bone to pick with this stripmall gem, their coffee sucks! I was expecting super-strong coffee with mud at the bottom when I ordered the cafe listo but it tasted like gas station coffee. They didn't even have any milk, just powdered non-dairy nonsense...I'm already a diehard fan but if they stepped up the coffee I would pretty much call it my mecca. This is the kind of food that makes all seem right with the world...Holy Shit!!! I almost forgot about the ceviche! It's a little pricey but it is soooo worth it. I split it with one of my people at work and ended up sharing it with the whole office......very much against my will. People thought it looked so good they just kept poaching forkfulls off my plate. Definietly a must have dish

"Tried this restaurant with a groupon. Probably would not have, if I didn't have the coupon. Don't let the storefront and decor stop you from going in. The restaurant is super clean and the wait staff is very friendly. And the food, WOW!  We split the Shrimp Ceviche and the combination pupusa plate. The portions were very generous. I ordered the fruit drink. Everything was absolutely delicious. One of my new favorite restaurants . Will definitely be back.

"YES! Thank you Salvadoreno for making my pupusa loving dreams come true! I just moved back to the valley after 6yrs away, having discovered and fallen in love with El Salvadorian food in the mean while. I was worried that I wouldn't find a good spot here as we some times lack in fine ethnic cuisine that isn't Mexican. I was tickled pink last night to discover Salvadoreno in an unassuming strip mall in Mesa (they have 2 other locations around the valley). The food was blissfully authentic as was the price. They even suggested a deal on the menu for 20 pupusas for $30. I might add this place to my bi-weekly grocery shopping list. I can't say enough about how happy I was to get real El Salvadorian food that hadn't been taken over by the flavors of Mexico, U.S. or Arizona. One of the family members who runs the joints was even there and everyone who worked there was quite friendly. I'm happy to support these guys. I will definitely be returning.

"Papusas!  This is one of the few places that I actually have cravings for.  You can't go wrong with any of the papusa flavors (carne asada is my favorite followed by loroco flower) and the fried plantains are an excellent treat.  Eat the papusas topped with the curtido (coleslaw) and salsa, it really pushes the flavor over the top.

"We had an excellent dinner at Havana cafe - I would say it is in my top five restaurants in Phoenix. Service was decent too - I am surprised to see the negative reviews on yelp.  I may be a bit biased because I studied in Costa Rica in college for a few months, so I love any latin american and carribean comfort food because it brings back great memories.We shared the platanos maduros and mofongo as appetizers and some mojitos to drink. The mofongo did not sound great to me when I looked at the menu description, but it was amazing. The platanos were great too. I had the pumpkin bisque, which was sweet, salty, creamy and delicious, and some rice and beans. My husband had a pulled pork dish which was also good, and we had some lime pie for dessert. Next time I would order  a little less food,but I am glad we could try each dish - everything was good. We will be back!

"All I needed to complete my delicious meal here was a good Cuban cigar and some brandy!We had the Papa Rellena for an appetizer... very very good. Its a beef filled potato cake with a cilantro lime sauce.For entrees my wife and I shared two dishes... the Ropa Viejas (shredded beef brisket in a tomato wine sauce) and the Gallina Frita (crispy fried shredded chicken, onions, in a mojo garlic lime sauce....amazing!Both dishes were large...with tons of meat.Great service and really good mojitos make for a nice evening out at the Havana Cafe.For dessert we indulged on the ""Best Of Phoenix"" (Phoenix New Times) Caramel Flan....

"My sisters columbian friend pointed us in this direction. I enjoyed this new ethnic experience. The moment I walked in, I was reminded of my my aunty's old restaurant shop. I do mean to say ""restaurant shop"" because that's exactly what it is. a restaurant and shelves of snacks, toys and other take-home things. I guess that's one reason why I love this place, for taking me back to a childhood I almost forgot.I've never been to any other columbian eatery, but word is that the portions are huge. Which they were.. for me and my sister anyway. We shared this plate of ""Tamal"" which came with a side of rice. By the way, the rice was surprisingly sweet. Almost like sticky rice. It really complimented the spices in the tamal. I've also discovered the best made empanadas ever! probably even better than filipino empanadas =X. It's unique for it's crispy crust and its pasty potato & beef mix inside. And what set it in stone for me was the ajiahjiahhee (oh whatever the spelling is) sauce.That place brought together family. Mainly because we realized we were sitting next to the family of my sisters friend. They also have a huge extended area. Cus the area we were in was the ""restaurant shop"" But the other side is specifically restaurant. It's good for big groups and such. Cus yeah, I'm all about rolling deep!

"This place has excellent food and service. I tried the Ajiaco soup and it was the BOMB especially when adding the sour cream. I also had the Empanadas and Papas Rellena and they were also to die for. I recommend this place for everyone to try.

"Love this place. Grew up in L.A and had home made pupusas  my BF house. It's just as good but it would hit the spot..

"Loved their Squash with cheese pupusas! Honesty when it come down to authentic salvadorian food you must try them here! Beside they are huge and I easily get stuffed with 2! Try them and to drink make sure to try their kolachampan (salvadorian soda) I so recommend for you guys to try them out!

"for about ten years this place has been my family favorite restaurant, every time they change something is for the better, love the food!, you can find the most of the Salvadorian plates! .....try the corn milk in winter time is so delicious! ...I love the new look inside the restaurant!

"Hands down still my favorite place to come for pupusas in town. This location has recently remodeled inside and it gives it a nice friendly face lift. The pupusas are always so hot and fresh and always cooked perfectly. Not oily, or too much masa and not enough filling. The curtido here is always crunchy and delicious. Never too salty or vinegary. I also love the variety of fillings they have at this location for pupusas. Chicharrones and cheese is one my favorites but the calabasas and cheese is definitely in my rotation now. I recently had the yucca and fried chicharrone and while it was not as delicious as my pupusas, it was good. The fried pork was definitely fried as it was super crispy and once I added some salt and tomato sauce it was good eats. The yucca was perfect. Soft and creamy on the inside and a nice bite on the outside.Helpful Hint: Call your order in ahead of time if you don't want to wait long for your food.  Also know that they charge $1.00 to use your debit.

"Hands down..THE BEST PAPUSAS IN LAS VEGAS AND HENDERSON..the great thing about Las Pupusas is that no matter which location you go to around town, the food is consistent and so tasty. I get queso and chicharron con queso with extra cabbage. The pupusas are made fresh to oder so it takes some time to get your order, well worth it. The fried yuca is good, as well as the platanos con sour cream.

"I have been getting my hair cut and hi-lighted at Mane Attractions for over 5 years, by Sue, the owner. I am always extremely happy with the way my hair looks.   My hair is very fine and I don't have a whole lot of it, but Sue does wonders with it, especially with my latest cut. I never wanted it shorter than shoulder length, but decided recently to make a change. Because I'm getting older, and other methods of increasing the volume and amount of my hair were too expensive, or didn't work,  I wanted to try a shorter cut. The cut she gave me made my hair look much thicker. I have had several compliments on the cut, one from another hairstylist who worked at Regis. Sue is also reasonable, charging $80 for my cut and hi-lights. I will admit that I had to wait outside the salon once when I was the first customer of the day, but that was once in over 5 years. I will take an occasional late opening in exchange for the great cutscolor I get!

"Let me just tell you, I have really, really difficult hair.  type 3b Naturally curly, 100% grey, I dye it dark and mess with the color myself. ( never good)  If you want to know where to get a good haircut you ask someone with my hair. Since I have been going to Mane Attractions I have really LOVED my hair. I have been going there for about 4 years. Kristi was even able to cut my curly hair into a short reverse bob without making me look like i was wearing a helmet. ( you curly girls know what I am talking about). I have had nothing but complements on my hair and even my mom( who is always honest) is impressed. The only complaint I ever have is that yes, sometimes I have gone there on the spur of the moment and it has been closed during the week. I just know to call and schedule things. it is a small business and I get it.  P.S. kids haircuts are only 10$ and My daughter loves it.
",1
"This place does gorgeous updos for $25 apiece. My bridesmaids and I went there on the day of (with no trial run beforehand) and we all had beautiful hair exactly the way we wanted it. The hairdressers are so friendly and attentive and so accommodating in letting 5 of us take over their relatively small shop for 2 hours on a Saturday. I was so happy to find them, and so happy not to pay $60+ a pop for wedding party hair!
",1
"Got my hair done in an updo (for only $25!!!!)  yesterday for my wedding.  they did amazing!  they listened to what i wanted and although it took quite a while (i have really long hair) she spent the time to do it right and exactly how i wanted it.  great service!!   The price is not high but the quality is!
",1
"Michelle is a godsend; went in for a simple, fuss-less updo and was stunned by the result. She is quite the perfectionist, and for $25, her mastery is bizarrely affordable. Forever bookmarked. (Note: street parking can be fairly difficult to find on S. Highland so scour the smaller adjacent streets for a free 2 hours.)

"Great for a quick cut.  $22 for extreme attention to detail and excellent finish.

"Rosemary is amazing for updos. Only $25 a piece but great attention to detail!

"I have been to the downtown Izzazu location several times (I have not yet had the chance to check out their new digs, however) and have always left really pleased.I have used their waxing and haircut services and have had no complaints.  In both areas, the girls I worked with took the time to listen to me before beginning work and I ended up with exactly what I was looking for.  I always got compliments on my hair after getting it cut.  As for price - their stylists are tiered and have different price scales.  I asked while on the phone making my appointment and had no surprises.  After trying many salons that didn't make the cut (yay puns!) and ending up with bangs, mullets, and other horrible cuts, I am sticking with Izzazu.
",1
"Rhiannon performs amazing feats on my fine hair and is able to accommodate to any stylecutcolor I throw at her - but not without making sure it's what I really want. She explains how a cut could work or not work for your face typelifestyle, etc. and really takes the time to listen. She's both professional and personable and I wouldn't want anyone else to fix my hair woes but her!
",1
"I've been going to Meg F. for two years and I've loved every cut she's ever given me. She listens to what I want but also always talks to me about how my hair type will respond to certain styles. I have difficult thick wavy hair and she does a great job managing my hair and teaching me tricks on how to style at home. Plus, she's very nice and always in a great mood so I really enjoy my time there. Izzazu has a beautiful new location, right downtown next to the Capital Grille. Parking is super easy, too. If you tell the people at the garage on Oliver Street you have an appointment there are reserved spots and you can just take the elevator right up to the salon. Great for bridal parties, too they have a gorgeous place for groups called the Serata. It's a formal styling suite for groups and private parties, really unique!

"Val is the best at the downtown location. I have had horrible mess-ups from other salons and she is able to fix them immediately. I will never go to anybody else. She listens to what I want and is able to perform...

"Friendly - exceptional talent - multiple services - top notch - check it out at least once.

"I have been coming to the Carrick Cost Cutters for several years and have had Valerie cut and color my hair all those years.  She is professional and talented.  I get what I need and am very pleased with my styles.  My husband uses this salon but he does not limit himself to any one stylist and he is pleased as well.

"This Starbucks is 5-Star Friendly. The shift supervisor Lucious keeps the energy in there moving and light. He recently helped me with a merchandise return and embodied everything a good manager and all around mensch person should - patience, kindness, generosity and fairness. I left that afternoon loving Starbucks even more than when I went in. It's great that a company and their employees can be as loyal to their customers as their customers are to them.

"I am always so pleased with the customer service here. For such a tiny Starbucks, the do a really great job serving the masses that come in there and still manage to take the time to be friendly in the midst of the frenzy. Outdoor seating in the summer is nice.

"On my recent road trip from Dallas to New Haven, CT, Randy S. and I stopped in Pittsburgh to revel in its charms. This, I must add, was in opposition to his mother's strong protests to the effect of, ""There's nothing *in* Pittsburgh, why would anyone go there"" Tazza D'oro is the answer to that question. Especially if you like coffee. This is easily one of the best coffee shops east of the Mississippi, and I've been to a lot of them. So, what's so good about itLet's go in order of importance:Coffee - It is really, really good. They use Batdorf and Bronson beans, where an ex-gf of mine used to work in Olympia. Believe me when I tell you that B&B is good. It's not amazingly great, but it's very solid and they take roasting seriously. When I go to a new coffee place I suspect might be good I always get a latte. Why This one has a high upside if done well and the lowest downside (lots of milk) if done poorly. I got a latte. They have a few sizes, 12oz was the first one I got. It was fantastic. They did a nice little rosetta in it too (look up latte art on google if you have no idea what this is). The baristo really knew what he was doing and pulled a some good shots with excellent crema. The coffee was so good (coffee is supposed to taste bold, smooth and rich, which it almost never does and this place had it down) I had to go back for an 8oz, which is another level of trust. It has the same amount of coffee but less milk to hide poor coffee quality. It was always superior. This is a coffee place that is truly top notch based on the coffee alone, but there was more. Pastries - They all looked amazing. I had a plain donut while I waited in line. Normally I don't eat plain donuts, because life is too short for plain donuts, but it was really, very good. Everyone was commenting on how nice the pastries were.Atmosphere - This place has it exactly right. It's a mom & pop feel, nothing forced. Some tables, outdoor seating, maybe some local art, but not in a goofy sort of way. Very friendly employees. Just a complete home run. Obviously I loved it. Behind me in line for my re-up, I heard a girl behind me in line complain, ""we could just go to Starbucks, it's cheaper!"" then proceeded to order with sugar free syrups and skim milk. That's fine. Everyone has to do what they like... and with the proliferation of bad coffee (Starbucks only being guilty of mediocre, though a little bit interesting coffee) over the past 10 years, I don't blame people for being set that way. But the beautiful thing about Tazza D'Oro (cup of gold in Italian) is that--if you let it--it will remind you that you don't need to make your coffee up like a drag queen on Halloween.Tazza D'Oro stands as a reminder that coffee can be enjoyed in all its naked glory in an awesome setting on a beautiful street and give you a good f'ing reason to go to Pittsburgh.
",1
"This is one of my two favorite coffeehouses in town. It took me far too long to come around and love Tazza D'oro. A horrible ex of mine loved this place and I admit that this soured me. I regret the time I wasted not going here. The dark wood inside comforts me. The small tables outside are a great place to spend the summer. Tazza D'Oro brews Batdorf and Bronson beans (amazing), provides Enrico pastries (amazing) free wireless (amazing) and one of the most talented and friendly staffs I've ever met (amazing). Everyone who works there is *so* nice and *so* good at what they do. They have a small menu of localfresh food that looks amazing, but I have never actually eaten it. The espresso served here is actually better than the average shot served at Batdorf and Bronson locations in Olympia, WA. I talked about this with one of the barristas at TD'o and they were offended - ""we calibrate our machines the same, we use the same beans, the exact same blends and milks and everything, it can't be different."" Sorry, Tazza D'oro, you are better. The lines get long on weekend mornings, but they move quickly. There's a sense of community nestled here, just off the ""main drag"" of Highland Park, between Bryant st. and the reservoir. This is where you can pick up your CSA shipment for the week, where multiple weekly bike rides originate, where there are lively discussion groups meeting nearly every day. The percentage of students is low. Like the rest of Pittsburgh, there's a good chance you'll run into someone you know, but generally I see people I like and miss, which is different than the norm in Pittsburgh for me.

"Do you see how all of the other reviews give this place 5 stars - this place is way more than a 5 star coffee shop.  I am giving all 5 stars to this delightful coffee shop because it is the perfect community coffee shop.  I am slightly saddened that they took out the 2 overstuffed chairs, but they need more tables because people like to come here and people hanging out in their community is a good thing.  It is 11:30 on a Monday morning and the place is almost full - there are always people coming going, getting coffee.It is a great place to sit and read the paper or to pick up some coffee on your way to some place else.Enrico's also has become a hub for other community activities - there a a couple of weekly bike groups that meet here.Other reasons to love this place (I know some of the other reviews highlighted these but I thought they were worth repeating).- free wifi- outside tables- tasty treats- they have a blog!- really great coffee- the staff are coffee experts

"Although I am not a coffee drinker, I do love their iced mochas!  They have wonderful teas, cider, hot chocolate.  The servers are wonderful and the brownies, as big as your head, are like crack.  Amy, the owner, has created a wonderful place for community.
",1
"Tazza D'Oro has a generally European decor, with dark, rich colors and textures, and a cozy layout that makes the most of the space. The espresso is, bar none, the best I've had - including my admittedly limited travels in Italy. It's stellar espresso - rich, thick, potent without being sour or bitter, with unique nuances that vary slightly depending on the shot and the weather, but are always fantastic.The coffee is also terrific, and Tazza D'Oro uses Batdorf & Bronson beans - the best I've ever had for home grinding. They have a good selection of pastries and cookies, as well as a broad selection of tasty sandwiches that come with a satisfying side salad.In addition, they have a wonderful selection of teas; I'm no expert, and don't know their supplier, but the half-dozen different blends I've tried were all memorably flavorful.All that, and it's a lovely center of community, where you can bring your laptop or a book or a friend and spend the day. No one is rushed out the door, and there almost always seems to be a little room for your studies or conversation.

"Best independent coffeeshop I've ever had the pleasure to visit.Best americano I've ever had.  Some of the best espresso I've ever had.  Great desserts, pastries, and cookies.  Good food.  The employees are awesome.The owner apparently put the shop there because their neighborhood didn't previously have anything like it.  The shop is also all about bicycling as transportation, sponsoring regular group rides around town, and also group walks for those not bicycle-inclined.

"Pros: Vegan food in Pittsburgh  YES!  great music, friendly accommodating service, huge variety of drinks, fabulous decorCons: Not a convenient location for the car-less me, but well that's just meHi, I am a non-drinker and rarely have I found an establishment with an extensive list of non-alcoholic drinks.  Granted, Quiet Storm like many Pittsburgh places doesn't have an alcohol license and has to make do.  Ginger lemonade  Yes.  All these other things from the soda fountain that are adult like enough for me  Yeah!I do love my meat, but found the vegan food here pretty good (albeit dry but I attribute that to my love of meaty things).  They used to have a prixe fixe meal on the weekends, but I think they got rid of that due to a low turnout.  Too bad most of Pittsburgh doesn't really learn to love culture.Usually good music acts here.  Although the few times I was here, there was barely anybody else there besides the group I dragged along and the band's friends.  Usually 2-3 acts play.  Live.  And it's nice that there aren't many of us because we can sit up close.  And be sure to kick the friend who thinks it's ok to talk over the music.  The bathroom also has a decor to match the style of the coffeehouse.I have never been here during the daytime so I can't comment on that.  Always great service when we came here for dinner and the music (since we were basically the only ones there).  Sometimes a minimal cover for the music.  There are books and comfy couches for the daytime coffee drinkers.
",1
"I used to live about four blocks from the Quiet Storm, and for a period breakfast here was an every day affair.  Those two facts have nothing to do with each other--the period in question was close to the end of the first semester of my (super-)senior year, when my friends and I would stay in our studios all night working, haul ass out to Quiet Storm for ambrosia-caliber restorative tofu scramble and coffee, and go back to school bright-eyed and bushy-tailed for another day of class.  And then usually I'd take a three-hour nap after the first class.  But I'm sorry, what is it I'm reviewing hereThe Quiet Storm has absolutely the best tofu scramble I've ever had.  I'm an accomplished vegan eater (I get stuff in my mouth first try nine times out of ten), I've had the best scrambles New York and San Francisco have to offer.  Believe you me, Quiet Storm tops them all.  I wish I knew their secret recipe, but the part I do know--baking the tofu rather than just sauteeing it--makes a tremendous difference.  Come in on a lazy Sunday morning, get the Nothin' Fancy, and you will see for yourself just how good tofu can be.  On top of that, they are as vegan-friendly as can be, with earth balance for the toast; soy, rice, and almond milks; and a selection of specifically vegan mixed drinks and milkshakes.  Plus, sandwiches!  Get the spicy spinach and peanut butter wrap, ask for added tofu (planks not crumble), and be astonished yet again.AND AND, as a delicious cherry on top, they have theme brunches, fantastic theme brunches that show off the creativity and chops of the cooks here in a way that the regular menu can only hint at.  Check out their website and see when the next theme brunch is, and make a point of going.  Get there early.
",1
"It's all about the Black & Gold. (Only on the brunch menu now, though!)And the Tofu Tenders.And the vegan baked goods from My Goodies.My only complaint is regarding the vegan milkshakes. Sorbet does not a milkshake make.
",1
"I looove Quiet Storm! It's a pain for the car less (me) to get to, and the service is fairly lacking, it's cash only with no convenient ATM's around, the closest business is a McDonald's half a mile away. And I still go there every chance I get. Hipsters abound (pro or con, depending on who you are) and the place is REALLY child friendly (again, could be a pro or con). But generally, the crowd is mellow, reading, chatting, just enjoying.The menu is designed in a way that they have something for everyone (except those adverse to eating healthy :). Between the veg and vegan options, they manage to have a menu that is fairly celiac friendly too, not an easy thing to do!A lot of the reviews here are about breakfast, which is amazing. But my favorite are their dinner salads. They're protein heavy, with a huge variety of ingredients, not your typical salads. And their specials, like tofu curry, are amazing, and always enough food for two.Oh, and the drink menu! I'm pretty much a water, coffee, beer kind of person, so I haven't tried too much on it. But everything looks amazing. Quiet Storm is one of those places that doesn't do a wide variety of things, but what they do, they do damn well!
",1
"I'm not sure how it took my wife & I so long to find this place! Before visiting the Quiet Storm I didn't realize that their entire menu was vegetarian, but that shouldn't be much of a problem even for fans of meat. I ordered the ""Maelstrom"" which is a what I would call a Mediterranean Quesadilla. The flavor was subtle, but delicious. There were plenty of menu options and it looks like this restaurant is really doing it's part to support the local community. The only complaint I would have was that the temperature also got a bit cold as we were sitting by the door... and it was winter. Finally, remember to bring enough cash to cover the bill as that's the only way to pay. I was not disappointed by the Quiet Storm and will definitely be getting back to this place next time I'm in Pittsburgh.
",1
"This is probably one of the most solid restaurants we have on Pittsburgh's east end.  It is also a haven for the veganvegetarian hipster.  I've been a handful of times now and only once did I get food I wasn't happy with.  Prices are reasonable, maybe like $1-2 more for food than you would expect to pay.  Keeping this place open is well worth that cost.If you aren't feeling so hungry, this doubles as a coffee shop (lacks some coffee shop seating) and the hot drinks are solid.  Check out the milkshakes!
",1
"CASH ONLY!!!  What a pleasant surprise!  I went here for the first time last night and wasn't sure what to expect when i walked in.  The place seems to have some spacial issues.  There was a bar but they don't serve alcohol, more of a coffeediner bar.  The tables and chairs seem odd and it took me a while to find a chair that was comfortable, but maybe this is by design.  I am not a coffee expert but i really enjoyed my several cups of decaf.  Anyhoo, to the food.  This place is vegetarian only.   I started with a Hummus plate, unlike most creamy hummuses this hummus was gritty as i could actually taste the chick peas with each bite.  The hummus was surrounded by fresh crisp cucumbers, carrots, celery, calamata olives (big fan) and pita. Perfect starter.  For my main entree i ordered the curry special.  Do not expect an Indian food experience but this will not disappoint.   Everything was in the bowl, chick peas, basmanti rice, carrots, and other miscellaneous items.  Once i started dipping my pita into it I could not stop.  It was savory, spicy and just the perfect compliment to the cold snowy night.    This is one storm i will enjoy braving from time to time.
",1
"Quiet Storm was the other bookend to my trip to Pittsburgh, providing a perfect balance with Zenith earlier in the week. It's a little out of the way, but once we got there, it's exactly the kind of place I want to live close to. It's spacious and relaxed; we sat there for two hours after eating our lunch and were not at all pressured to move on. It had a very good neighborhood vibe, and everyone working there knew the place and the area really well.The drink options were pretty great- the coffee was just fine, but the ginger lemonade I ordered a couple hours after lunch was phenomenal. I wish I could have that more often. The food was great; there are lots of options and the portion sizes were exactly what I wanted. I had the Dagwood sandwich, which was a perfect mix of sweet, sour, and spicy with hummus, apples, hot peppers, cucumbers, and pickles... it came with an option of the side, and I had to try the mockamole. A big fan of guacamole myself, I was totally in doubt of a green pea-based mock version. I also really like peas, though, so I was open. And somehow they managed to make it work, and it really did taste very much like guac, with a slightly less heavy and maybe a bit grainier texture. But definitely worth a try. My friend had a wrap with curry and tofu and I honestly don't remember what else, but it was huge and really tasty. She chose the potato salad as her side, and it was the perfect imitation of German potato salad, so I was pretty happy. All in all, if you're in Pittsburgh and feel a little lost... go to Zenith and Quiet Storm, and you will feel found.

"Fun, unique atmosphere (hippie  indy  hipster  whatever these kids are calling it these days). Interesting, tasty food. Above all, awesome retro decor. A Pittsburgh treasure.

"I was really impressed by this place. I will first start with the service: The waiter was very friendly and it took me awhile to go over the menu since I've never been there. He was patient and stated ""take your time, no hurry"". He offered me suggestions. We even discussed shoes for a brief minute, very personable. The food: The menu was quite extensive...hoagies, soups, pasta, salads, etc. They also have stuff for kids like grilled cheese. I ended up ordering the lentil loaf with steamed vegetables and smashed potatoes. The food came out QUICK, like 5 minutes and everything was fresh and great. Did I mention this also came with soup I paid $13 total for my meal and a cold chai. Could not ask for more. My only and I mean only complaint is that they only serve lunch at lunch time, the only serve dinner at dinner time, etc..so be mindful of the time of day you go....

"This Starbucks is right down the street from my parents house. It's gotta be my favourite location in the Pittsburgh area. I read Joe D's review and laughed a bit. He's right...there are some guys who sit in there, but have you ever said hello Have you ever asked them if you could sit down They're totally nice guys! The baristas here are really efficient (most of the time) and super friendly. They're on top of their game and even remember regular's drink orders.

"Jason and his team are awesome!! The store is beautiful and sparkly clean. My beverages were on point and the pastries were yummy!! Great work guys!!

"So, now that the old timer glee club has abandoned this location, I can truly say that the relocation of this 'Bucks has become my favorite. Totally comfortable location, somewhat friendly associates, no fireplace anymore but I can overlook that. Lots of comfy leather chairs, you feel totally at home here. Normal coffee and tea menu, pastry case is always tempting and filled. Parking can be a hassle, but isn't that the case with any outdated strip malls in the Burgh
",1
"I've been coming here ever since I can remember. The Baristas seem genuinely interested in your well-being. They all have great personalities and are a joy to talk to when I come in. Dan, while appearing super intimidating (spiky black hair, wears leather jackets and stuff) is extremely nice. I went away for college and when I came back he asked me all about it. Becky always remembers my orders and Astrid makes my iced coffee just right. I could sit in there for hours and I often do.
",1
"The barista was super sweet. I told her I wanted something new and she was a fountain of information. She made a lot of great suggestions and I told her to wing it. She went with a Caramel Brulee with two pumps of White Mocha. She also gave me a discount, which was awesome.I used an AirCard on the netbook and sat in Starbucks from 11am-2:30pm. I had headphones on and just zoned out. I was comfortable and wasn't disrupted at all.It seemed to get busy from 1pm-2pm so if you want to stop at this location, make sure to get there earlier so you can grab a seat.
",1
"I have a very very soft spot in my heart for this Starbucks.  I spent my whole college life and a little bit after serving up Market Square's best coffee, tea and assorted goodies!I know I'm totally biased but I really do feel like this is the best Starbucks in the city!  No other store has such a cozy feel to it.  I may have fallen asleep in the big comfy chairs by the fireplace a couple times.  I mean, it was hard slingin coffee all day!  Especially when you have to get up at 5 AM to be there at 5:30 AM (yeah, I totally rolled out of bed to go to work).  It gets SLAMMED around 6:30 or 7 with the before work crowd.  I can still remember people's faces and what they ordered.  I could never understand the woman who ordered a Venti (large) 8 pump white chocolate mocha with whip EVERY morning.  I guess girl needed her sugar to survive in the AM.  The nice thing is they're ALWAYS open.  Much to the chagrin of me and my coworkers with the madness of LIght Up NIght and St. Patrick's day drunken festivities.  But it's nice for the tourists to stop in and grab a quick drink and some advice on where to go downtown on a Saturday morning.  I'm thankful now when I'm downtown on a Sunday because I know it's one of the ONLY places open!  It's just a really great place to meet a friend to catch up or sit and study.  Plus they offer free wi-fi, which is always a plus!Just remember, Barista's are people too!!  Grunting out ""tall coffee"" instead of a hello doesn't usually fly as a good greeting.  Cheer up, you're getting caffeine soon!

"Brittany was great! Fun personality, quick at getting you through your order, and super nice. We shared a little joke as I made my order - kind of hard to explain here - but made the mundane experience of ordering a coffee into a lot of fun, which is great because I was just heading off to the airport for a nice long vacation - started me off with a smile. :-)Best. Cashier. Ever.

"Whether you are a serious coffee drinker, or you know someone who is, this is the perfect place to buy bulk coffee.  And if you do have a good friend or relative who loves coffee, this is the best place to get a distinctive gift for that person.Nicholas Coffee Company has been around a long time, since 1919 actually.  One  thing that makes their coffee so good is that they roast them on the premises.  You can really taste the difference versus getting bulk coffee at Starbucks or Dunkin' Donuts.  Some of my favorite blends include the Ethiopian Harrar, Costa Rican Tarrazu, and if in the mood for something a little stronger and darker, I recommend the French Roast.  They have their private blends too.I'm not into tea as much, although I'll buy here in the summer to make ice tea.  And they do sell Chinese Restaurant tea, which Rick and I love to brew when we order Chinese take-out.  They also have a lot of boxed teas and gift teas for the tea lover in your life.  Want to know what ""China Gunpowder Temple of Heaven"" is  http:www.nicholascoffee.netwebstorestorefrontItemBuy.cfmItemID=451They also have a lot of teapots and coffee makers if you are looking for a nice gift for someone.  And how many coffee roasters sell cigars  My confession:  I've smoked cigars on rare occasion and I actually do like the mild ones!  One last thing, their website http:www.nicholascoffee.netwebstorestorefrontstoremain.cfmCFID=4407284&CFTOKEN=92186416 is very good and it has a lot of good tips on brewing good coffee and tea.

"Every time I visit from Chicago... I run over here before or after visiting Primanti's.  I've even demanded we stop here before returning home - I buy enough coffee to last me 6 months, when I know I will return again.  It's the best place in Pittsburgh to buy coffee & tea in bulk.  I buy a coffee to drink as I shop, a few bags in bulk for family members, and a ton of smaller bags for myself at work.  They even have flavored-honey filled straws for tea, cigars, and all sorts of accessories.  I love stopping here during the holiday season.  I make a huge gift basket for my parents.  And it's all at a great price!!

"Walking into this shop is like giving your eyes a sweet indulgence, and the sensory aromatics of freshly roasted beens will leave your taste buds craving for that hot java.  Rows of specialty coffees, teas and candies line the walls  and create the feeling of a genuinely unique experience. It's got a small town feel, which is rmost efreshing! for a Downtown location. Specialty drinks are their modus operandi, like the Chocolate Banana Bread Latte, or my humour favorite: Fat Guy in a Little Coat Latte!! I have been in a number of times, both in busy rush hours and during the inbetween hours. The service has ALWAYS been friendly, efficient & creative, so don't hesitate to ask a few questions and try a new combination. I'm also a huge loose tea fan, and have yet to explore this aspect of the shop. They seem to have an impressive inventory. This is the BEST coffee and speciality  bean shoppe in Pittsburgh, hands down!
",1
"I have no complaints here.  European-style shop for gourmet coffee and tea.  You can buy fresh-brewed coffee or beans and loose leaf tea in bulk starting with a 14 pound and up.  Besides that, the shop is crammed with coffee and tea supplies, candies, and chocolates.  Good prices.  Friendly, knowledgeable staff.I usually buy coffee, but the last time I went in for green tea and wanted to try something new.  The man who waited on me didn't know a whole lot about tea, so he did something amazing:  he found someone else who did!Tip: Go on Thursday afternoons when Market Square has their farmer's market and pick up some fresh produce and pierogies, too.

"I LOVE Nicholas Coffee. I have been working near Market Square for over a year now.  After my first few months of Starbucks disappointments, I ventured into Nicholas. They have a very large selection of coffees, teas, and European import items. Their pumpkin spice latte not only tastes like pumpkin pie, but its a full $2 cheaper than Starbucks'.  Every day, they make fresh whipped cream, roasted peanuts, and peanut butter.All of the baristas are extremely friendly and helpful. They also have amusing facebook updates, some of which contain Bill Cosby sweater references. I also enjoy their innovative latte creations (See the 'Batman' themed latte menu I posted). Nothing to complain about.

"With the return of nice weather to the'Burgh, I've been able to get out on lunch and do some shopping.  I took a stroll down here 'cos it felt good to get out of the office and besides, I'm getting a little tired of the coffee from Giant Eagle.  Maxwell House and Folger's are okay, but soemtimes we need a little variety.So I picked up some Olde Vienna which is a little darker than most American roasts, but not as dark as French Roast.  I also picked up a nice Kenya AA blend.  But I'm also become a tea lover and I picked up some Stash Decaffeinated Earl Grey--makes a great ice tea!  Great coffee and service here.  It's been a few years since I was here last and I'm gonna have to stop by more often.
",1
"One of the best places to buy coffee in the city. The Raspberry Truffle Latte is my personal favorite, but be sure to try their other speciality drinks that they post. Great location (Market Square), great environment and atmosphere, and friendly and helpful staff. Get a cuppa!
",1
"Best coffee ever! I never miss an opportunity to try whatever flavor of coffee they are brewing at Nicholas Coffee Co. Every day they have three different brews, one being flavored, and all delicious. They have every flavor you could possibly imagine (and sell the beans if you don't want to wait for them to brew your favorite one). The candy shop is pretty awesome, too.
",1
"When I worked downtown years ago, Nicholas Coffee was the ""nuts"" so to speak.   Now that I'm back working in town again, I was ecstatic that I can get a fresh cup of fabulous flavored coffee every morning as I walk to work through Market Square.If you are a high maintenance coffee person, this is the place for you!  The flavored coffee is the BEST, one can immediately taste the difference from the brews here and the nauseating Hazelnut that is sold at every other place that sells coffee.  That flavor should be banished from the Earth, but that's another story.Try the Graham Cracker, Chocolate Orange, Almond Joy or Coconut, delicious!  Nicholas also carries freshly baked biscotti in a variety of flavors as well as other eclectic baked goods. A must stop for visiting guests and coffeetea lovers!

"They are in fact ""the oldest coffee store"" in Pittsburgh, being created in 1919. I wanted breakfastlunch and nothing was open in Market Square until 11am so this little place caught my eye. They don't roast, pack, or warehouse their products, but roast small batches of Arabican beans daily at optimum temperatures to insure peak flavor. Upon walking in I was greeted with the scintillating waft of fresh coffee beans. Tons of different flavors of Torani syrups also lined the walls, making my decision even that much harder. They had fancy lattes with turtle, chocolate, raspberry, etc enticing names. I decided to stick with one of their brews for the day: Southern Pecan roast and had it just black. It was quite delicious. My sister just asked for a large coffee on ice. I'm not sure which roast she ended up with but the flavor was gone after she drenched it with milk and nasty saccharine. Still delicious for an iced coffee but I can't deal with those people that like their coffee in milkshake form. Upon leaving and inspecting the various bags of beans and teas I noticed this place also sells cigars! Hot dog. What a gem.

"This is probably the best place in Pittsburgh to get an espresso, cappucino, or latte.  It's a small, no-frills coffee company -- don't come in here asking for a soy non-fat no-whip caramel crappacino or whatever, because you will be laughed out the door.  They roast their own coffee, and you can also buy their coffee (whole bean or ground) and take it home with you to brighten your mornings.  They have a coffee-of-the-month club, which I aspire to join someday.The best time to visit La Prima is a Saturday morning in early fall.  The Strip will be in its full bustle.  Go up to the counter, try to puzzle out the Italian saying on the chalkboard while you wait, order a coffee, and sit outside at one of the iron tables.  The delicious-smelling coffee steam will waft up in the crisp morning air, old Italian men will have just started their mornings of sitting outside, smoking cigars, and making fun of each other over interminable coffees, and all will be right with the world.
",1
"Best Espresso Hands down. Makes me want to hop on a plane and come home for a weekend just to wake up on a Sunday and hear italian men next to me while I sip my espresso machiatto.
",1
"What draws me here is the ambiance. It transports me to a grungy neighborhood caffe typically found in Italian small towns and villages. In other words, the place is a charmless room awash in harsh fluorescent lights.  It has a couple of high tables but no seats (well, when the weather is good, they have outdoor seats). The regulars take their espresso standing, half chatting with each other, half watching whatever RAI programming that is showing on the TV.  In addition to the espressocappuccinolatte, I recommend the freshly squeezed juice. I don't know why, but theirs just taste better than others. I also like to get a breakfast pastry from the bakery next door.
",1
"What an amazing find!  I have become so jaded in my travels with generic coffee shops pretending to be Italian because they have Italian roast coffee and a picture of the Colosseum above the register, as if that is all it takes.  No, this place is the real deal, through and through.  I really felt like I was back in Italy the moment I walked in.  Up on the TV there was an Italian football game being broadcast in Italian.  In front of me in line were a group of people discussing the merits of Lambrusco wine from Modena and how its ""Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita"" certification is reason enough not to confuse it with lesser imports marketed under the same name.  Mind you, this conversation was entirely in Italian.  Meanwhile, behind me there were some old men have an entirely different conversation in Italian.  This was by no means unique to my first visit either.  It really is a slice of Italy here!Authentic ambiance aside, the coffee is rather good too.  My only lament is that their large is not an Americanized large.  They have a pretty nice selection of bags of organic and fair trade beans should you wish to brew some at home.  Espresso  They are actually one of the wholesalers for espresso machines in the city, and they actually service the machines.  Yeah, they know what they're doing.  You really can't miss at all here.  The best part though is that this is genuinely a place where you want to hang out, relax, and socialize.  It's wonderful!

"I am one of those people who needs to put things in my coffee. I can't drink it black.  La Prima Espresso Company has actually broken me out of this habit. I went back here several times over a 3 day period during my visit in Pittsburgh. We stumbled across this cute Italian coffee shop on our way to watch the runners at the Pittsburgh Marathon. I needed coffee and I needed it now. This was the first place I saw.  To my amazement, the coffee was probably some of the best I've had. I kid you not.  I did not have to put anything in it (I did add some cinnamon though).  It is fantastic!  Perfectly brewed to perfection.  I even bought a bag of beans of La Prima's own Grow Pittsburgh brand bold flavor that they have made locally. It's delicious!This is a really authentic Italian coffee shop attached to a bakery and a wonderful find right off ""The Strip"" in Downtown Pittsburgh.

"I'm rarely blown away by coffee.  I mean, McDonald's and Dunkin Donuts make some reasonably tasty coffee at very affordable prices.  I've never been a fan of Starbucks, too bitter and expensive.  But when I can I will frequent local coffee shops looking for something amazing.  Well La Prima is that something amazing.I first encountered their coffee at Coca Cafe.  I don't usually taste coffee and say, ""Wow, that coffee is really good!""  But on the occasion where I first tasted La Prima, that's exactly what I said.  That was months ago and I don't know why it took me so long to make it down to their shop in the Strip.  Perhaps because it is the summer and one of the last things on my mind during this time is hot beverages.  Now every time I brew some of those fresh beans, I feel like I'm treating myself and I enjoy the taste of just the coffee without adding sugar andor cream. It's a very welcoming place if not a bit overwhelming with all the choices.  But if you're in the Strip and looking for a good cup of coffee, La Prima Espresso Company is highly recommended!
",1
"The best place for coffee!!! I love everything about this place.. The atmosphere, the neighborhood feel, the baristas, and the patrons (especially the little Italian men sitting outside playing cards drink espressos). A huge favorite place in my book!!!
",1
"La Prima is an excellent, no nonsense coffee shop.  It gets very crowded on Saturdays, but I always try to stop in for a double espresso.  You're not going to want to bring your computer.
",1
"Cute little shop and delicious coffee!! They have all the regular stuff with a few specialty drinks. The menu is mixed in with some fancy italian terms.. :) I decided to go with moka which was a really good choice. And without knowing what egg cream (chocolate) is, my friend ordered it out of curiosity. We were told that it was made out of sparkling water (they use san pellegrino I believe as they also sell that as bottled drinks), chocolate syrup and foamed milk. It was served on ice. I have never had the combination of milk and sparkling water and it is surprisingly good! Good option for non-coffee drinkers.The best part It is 2 doors down from a popcorn store(which is also a local favorite too, expect lines out the door). We ended up sitting outside enjoying coffee and popcorn for the rest of the afternoon.

"Best espresso I have had outside of Italy.

"i had a fantastic experience here. I got to the shop just before they weer about to close, but the owner was very gracious about creating an arrangement for me. The flowers were lovely. I would make a special trip just to purchase from this shop again.

"Elizabeth from The Botanical Emporium did my wedding flowers and they were absolutely beautiful! They were so easy to work with and made me feel completely at ease. My flowers were everything I ever wanted and more. When I saw my bouquet it actually brought tears to my eyes! The greenhouse is amazing!  I very highly recomend the Botanical Emporium for all of your floral needs.
",1
"What a cool place! I have NO green thumb WHATSOEVER, but had passed by for about a year now since I moved to Dormont and had always thought the shop looked cute. Now was my chance as I needed a last minute Christmas present for my grandma. The place is larger than you think from the outside. They actually have a whole outdoor area that's covered for the winter with many different plants I couldn't identify. I thought the owner was super duper sweet and just really energetic. Her and another staff member helped me pick out a plant that was in a vase, not in a pot, and looked really cool and modern. I loved it and had a fleeting thought to pick one up myself... if I wouldn't kill it (which I probably would!). I had commented about a table full of vases filled with what looked like works of art. They turned out to be flower displays for hotels, but man where they cool. If I was doing an event or having a wedding, that's exactly what I would have wanted. They just looked really modern but creative. They also have some winged friends you can say hi to, including one screaming one in the back that you can't see. Kinda creepy, but I guess that comes with a unique shop! I will absolutely be back to pick up items for people and consider them for any events I have coming up.

"Lovely floral arrangements for every occasion.  Her boutonnieres and corsages are lovely and inexpensive - she must have made dozens for me and my friends during high school.  You cannot beat the service here.  When students at the elementary school up the street come in wanting flowers for their teachers, she will provide them with the best for only $1 or $2.  Blooming Dahlia is the best example of hometown service I could imagine.
",1
"Don't buy those old pre-made arrangements from the grocery store or the overpriced stingy bunch of flowers from other places.  Come here- the service is great and the price is very reasonable.  Without realizing it, we walked in 5 minutes before closing time.  Regardless, the owner greeted us warmly and said she would be happy to help us.  I told her I didn't know anything about flowers, so she asked for a price range and the proceeded to select and arrange a fresh bouquet.  Even though it was the end of the day, the flowers were still perky and the arrangement was spectacular.  Couldn't have been happier and will recommend it to everyone I know.
",1
"The best bouquet of flowers I have purchased in years. The store was closed but the door was unlocked and the owner gave me a warm getting and created a great arrangement. I love that they do not sell pre arrangements, all are made as you wait. The so smells amazing. Well be my new go to for flowers.

"To say that these guys go above and beyond is an understatement.  My daughter was recently hospitalized and her boyfriend sent flowers.  Unfortunately they were delivered to the hospital the day my daughter was discharged (a good thing that she go out early!!).  Jim from Blumengarten called me from the hospital - which was a good 25 minutes away and offered to meet me halfway to ensure the flowers were delivered.  He told me he would meet me in about 30 minutes.  We both pulled into the parking lot at the exact same time and my daughter received her flowers.  I know who I am ordering flowers from next time I need them!!  Thanks again!!
",1
"I chose them because they answered the phone after 5. I was originally going to use a nearer florist. The worker I dealt with was incredibly helpful. As I did not have an exact address to give him, only the name of my girlfriends employer. He said he would look up the address and number, then call them for exact directions. The flowers were delivered within 24 hours and were the best I have ever purchased! I wish I could give them more than five stars!

"We live in Virginia and my wife's 72 year old mother lives in Pittsburgh. We typically send her flowers for her birthday, but we've had some issues with the well-known national flower delivery businesses, so I thought I'd see how things went if I cut out the middleman and dealt directly with a local florist. It was a good move. The flowers arrived on time and according to my mother-in-law the arrangement was spectacular and the flowers were so fresh that she was sure they'd keep for a good while. I also was happy that Ludwig's didn't gouge me on all of those extra fees that usually get tacked on at check-out by the big companies. My advice from now on is to go local whenever you can. With the internet that's no longer a problem.
",1
"I live in Boston, Ma,but my boyfriend lives in Pittsburgh and I was in need of flowers for a funeral service.  Considering I know nothing about what is top rated in Pitt, I looked to the web to try and find a good florist.  I saw Blumengarten and glad I decided to use their services!  The gentleman on the phone was so wonderful.  I explained that I needed flowers delivered to the funeral home in a few days.. I told him the two flowers that were her favorite and said that they needed to be used, but to do what ever else he thought would make the flowers beautiful.  I gave him the amount I wanted to spend and left it all up to him.  Absolutely wonderful customer service!   The day of the service I got a text from my boyfriend saying my flowers were stunning and and the most beautiful ones there!  Was so happy I chose Jim Ludwig's Blumengarten Florist and will continue to use them!!!  On a separate occasion, I also ordered some flowers online and had them sent to my boyfriends work as a surprise.  Again, absolutely beautiful, cheery flowers!!!!  I got a picture of them sent to me and couldn't have been more happy with what was delivered.
",1
"I can't say enough good things about Jim Ludwig's Blumengarten.  We hired them to do the flowers for our wedding in April, 2012 and the flowers were gorgeous!  My bridal bouquet was so beautiful and fragrant that it made me cry!  What I especially loved was that Jim and Linda Ludwig personally delivered the flowers to the venue.  Jim pinned the boutonniere on my husband and personally handed me my bouquet.  Such excellent customer service is rare these days and I highly recommend this business.
",1
"I'm a foreigner and wanted to send flowers to my girlfriend living in a suburb of Pittsburgh. I contacted Jim Ludwig's Blumengartens florist after finding them here. Unfortunately they didn't deliver to the city I wanted my flowers to be sent to, but the Ludwigs have been very helpful and transferred my order to another florist that covered that area. The contact has been fast and very friendly. I'll recommend and would consider them again.
",1
"Bob Ludwig at Blumengarten is the best! I had a last minute event for which I needed very specific flowers. I called in to make sure they had orchids, which they got just for me in less than a day. I wanted to pick the rest on site, but got there with a few minutes left until closing time and in a rush to deliver them myself. Bob made me a beautiful arrangement at a reasonable price very quickly. I am going to go here for all my future flower needs!
",1
"We worked with Sherry at Jim Ludwig's for our wedding flowers in June 2013. They did a truly wonderful job. The flowers were stunning. Sherry was great to work with, and they were very respectful of what our budget was. Many other places I went to advised me they could not remain within our budget, and therefore they lost our business (and our budget was very reasonable) so I appreciated how much they worked with us. Definitely recommend them!

"I just utilized this florist today for the first time. My mum's bday is today and I decided last minute that I wanted to send her a bouquet of flowers for a reasonable price and same day delivery. While looking thru some florists in the Pittsburgh area, I saw a yelp review that this florist delivers on same day service. I visited the website and saw so many bouquets of beautiful flowers at reasonable prices. I contacted them via phone- placed a same day delivery, and overall was very pleased w the customer service. My final review of Blumengarten's comes down to the approvement & excitement of my mum- who was very pleased w the flowers.Kudos to Blumengarten, you've gained a new a customer.

"Have ordered from Jim about 5 or 6 times and each order was flawless. They do everything right - efficient in taking an order, putting together a beautiful arrangement, and getting it delivered when it is needed. Our most recent order was a few days ago for a funeral viewing and it was very nice as always.  Great people, quality work, and you don't need to wonder if they are going to get it right. They are our go-to florist.

"Walk through the door and immediately the sweet, spicy scents of flowers and greens envelops your senses. Fresh green earthy ferns, spiky AND soft cacti, terrariums filled with tiny worlds you'd love to explore in Tiny Alice form all crowd antique tables, shelves and hutches - a bounty of natural wonders there for sweet discovery. The walls teem with both strikingly colorful and softly demure wreaths and wall accents. One glass topped and fronted case has huge jars of the most wonderful potpourri that you can scoop to your heart's content....just imagining your bedroom, living room, your entire home smelling like a little piece of heaven. Then, just as you pass that glass case an open door and a secret garden beckons with wonders of green outside. Melodious chimes, gurgling water, wondrous plants that you are certain deserve special places under no less than the glass roofs of Phipps Conservatory. What a wonderful respite from the rush and noise of the Strip....a quiet oasis. Thanks, Roxanne. Well done.

"I adore Roxanne's! There are so many beautiful arrangements and terrariums, and a great variety of live plants inside and out. You can also find lovely home decor in the form of side tables and such. On that note, I have even purchased an ethically made dress here! The employees are always a pleasure to chat with, and prices are reasonable for the quality you get. Even if you're not in the market for any of the aforementioned, stop in here and fulfill your senses.

"Awesome little home decor shop in Pittsburg.  We stumbled upon this place while exploring the city.  I posted some pictures for you to check out.  They have a great selection even though it's not a massive store.  People are friendly and well trained to help you find whatever you are looking for.

Need party supplies  They've got it!  Need a bouncy ball  They've got it!  You really need to step in here to get the full picture of everything they have to offer....because, it's basically everything!  I've come in here looking for one specific item and walked out with twenty non specific items.  That's just how it goes here!  Seriously, if you're throwing a themed party, looking for unique gift or need Steelers merchandise, this is the place for you because you'll more than likely find it...and walk out with more than you planned on getting!  But that's the fun of shopping here!

"I freakin' love this place. Anything you could possibly want, they've got it. And probably a lot of stuff that you don't want. I loved that everyone listed the crazy things they've seen there - they have all of that and so much more. 2 gems a friend got while we were there: a giant bottle of sriracha sauce & a fake tattoo sleeve. Ha!!All I got was a postcard, this was the only place I found in the Strip District that sold them. Will definitely be back, and will remember to leave plenty of room in my suitcase next time!

"This little store, which sells Italian (Irish, and some other) decor and home-y things, ROCKS. Maria, the owner, also does cooking classes in the apartment upstairs. If I still lived in Pittsburgh, I'd LIVE there.
",1
"I can't believe there aren't more reviews for this place... I didn't get a chance to look around the store - I went for a meal in Maria's kitchen upstairs.  It really is HER KITCHEN, not a restaurant... There is only one table that seats 8-10 people.  But her cooking is amazing.  Lots of home-style italian favorites come out in a fabulous 6 course meal.  I could have eaten just the antipasti alone as a full meal; the standout was a baked pumpkin full of gruyere, herbs and croutons... delicious.  For dinner, we had butternut squash soup with gorganzola and pecans, homemade pasta with a pistachio cream sauce, veal chops and an italian vegetable medely that was perfect with everything else.  Tiramisu for desert.  Everything that came out was delicious and perfectly prepared - plus Maria was standing right there in the kitchen to answer any questions we had about the food or cooking in general.  Wine was BYOB, and I think we went through ~10 bottles.  No corkage fees...This is an amazing dinner for those who have patience.  Maria is booked around 7 months in advance for those looking for a weekend date.  Do like I did - make your reservation, put it on the calendar and be patient... it's worth the wait.

"I can't say enough about Merante's and Maria. The back of the shop has wonderful baked goods. Pies, breads and of course the best biscotti around! Though, the true treasure exists in the upstairs apartment where Maria has cooking classes and serves a 6 course meal to parties of  8-10 most nights of the week. I heard about the private parties while at a food tour of Bloomfield. I knew I needed to get a reservation but, I had no idea how difficult that task would be. We scheduled a dinner in October for the first available Friday or Saturday which was 6 months later! That's right folks, 6 months in advance! The menu changes seasonally and is posted on the website. We ordered earlier in the week so that Maria had time to purchase the necessary items and prepare our meal. The menu would typically be the same for all 8 in the party but, Maria graciously offered to allow us to split the entrees into a meat and a non meat option to allow those who don't eat meat on Fridays during lent to have another option. When we arrived, we all enjoyed the appetizers in a sitting room at the front of the apartment. The appetizers themselves were a meal- meatballs, bread, shrimp, spinach pie, stuffed tomatoes and cheese with roasted peppers- all of which were incredible. Bring along your wine as Merante's is BYOB. The next course was soup which we were served in the formal dinning room which opened to the small kitchen where Maria cooks your meal. At first it was a little awkward sitting so close to the kitchen and Maria. Imagine having dinner at your grandmother's home with 7  of your closest friends. But, Maria did a great job of giving us our privacy. We hardly even noticed that she was there. After the soup came the pasta (homemade gnocchi anyone), then the entrees and vegetables, then the salad and last, the dessert. This was a meal fit for a king! The portions were huge! Luckily, Maria boxed up the leftovers making for an easy lunch the next day. If your lucky, you may even get to take home a little extra something such as extra sauce or a homemade truffle. Absolutely everything about this dinner was perfection. Everything (from the food to the service and hospitality) was done with the utmost care and concern to ensure a wonderful experience. I would literally come here every month if it were possible. Unfortunately, Maria is booked through the end of 2014! Not one day available in the next 8 months! My only complaint, Maria is in serious need of a clone.

You've got my business for sure.

"I love love love this store. It's a mecca of kooky gifts, books, cards, calendars, tshirts, jewelry, candles... pretty much everything you could ask for. I've spent over an hour just browsing, and around the holidays or birthdays, it's the best place to go if you have no idea what to get. You can pick up anything from a barista action figure to chocolate body paint to the complete set of Harry Potter hardback books. And don't forget the fizzy bath salts or the stick-on mustaches.

"Despite the kooky spelling, Kards Unlimited is a great place to shop for a gift. The card selection is extensive, so if you go there in search of a card you're unlikely to head home empty-handed. Even better, there's a wide assortment of knick-knacks and books that are perfect as gifts or impulse purchases for yourself. It's easy to lose track of time as you wander up and down the narrow aisles.

"Such a great store. They stock everything (EVERYTHING), including: cards, hand puppets, necklaces, books, etc... Kards Unlimited seems to take great care in choosing store products for sale. Definitely my favorite store on Walnut.
",1
"I regret to say that I have walked past this store for four years and never went in. That's four years of gifts that I could have found in one place. The books, staionary, gift wrap, and kookyfun gifts are all instant inspiration. They have way too many things to classify the store or its demographic, but if you need something unique and have no idea of what it is just go in and look around. You'll find it.

"Probably THE best card and gift store in the East End of Pittsburgh, if not the entire city.  Even the picky and indecisive card shopper (such as myself) can find plenty of good choices.  Need a present to go along with that card  You can make a one-stop trip to Kards Unlimited.  There are toys for both kids and adults, gag gifts like beer goggles, books, bath and body products, ornaments and what is my favorite to look at, funky jewelry.  If you're shopping for a literary friend, a bunch of the paper collage-style necklace pendants incorporate literary references (Why, yes, I would like one!).  Even if you're not shopping for a lovable female book nerd, the jewelry is beautiful.The aisles can get cramped with people browsing, but you can't blame them--there's just so much to see.
",1
"They have a huge selection of greeting cards in the back, but I've usually come here to browse the books (lots of Kurt Vonnegut) or the stationary and other gifts like that (notepads like ""While you were out"" but with snarky commentary). Not only do you have a ton of options here, but they're very well curated options. One of the very best gift shops around!
",1
"Much more than just a card shop. A very unique store. Tons of pop culture stuff. Take your time and look around.
",1
"I have to stop myself from stopping here once a week and stocking up on cards I don't yet need. Great card selection and perfect for gift shopping, they literally have something for everyone.  I go at least as often as I need a card for some occasion and they always have new things. A bit expensive but worth it to support this great store.

"A door sign reads ""hiring enthusiastic, energetic and humorous employees"" , so I walk-in. Immediately my expectations are exceeded as a lady behind the desk responds to a radio call from the staff upstairs announcing that her radio (which is strapped to her body) vibrates every time someone calls her and she ""kinda likes it"". I couldn't help but laugh out loud the first 30 seconds I walked through the door. Super savvy, humorous and fun: This is one novelty shop you don't want to pass up! I left with unique childrens books & hand puppets for my son, silly sticky notes for my secretary's desk, witty comic novels, and an irresistible coin pouch. It's more than shopping in here, it's a whole experience. Go in, get lots for awhile...

"One of the few non-people I have purposefully sought out and ""liked"" on Facebook, Kards Unlimited has the highest quality and variety of cards I've ever seen. Plus wacky tees. Plus random crap usually found in gift shops at the airport, only with infinitely more edge and non-bloated prices. I always stop in for a visit when I'm wandering around Walnut and I rarely leave empty handed.

"Named for Pittsburgh greats, Gene Kelly and Billy Strayhorn, this historic theater is a real gem.  Originally the Regent, built in 1914, the building was renovated in 2000 as a performing arts center for theater, dance, music and film.  I have been to several fundraisers hosted by the Kelly Strayhorn, and they have always been first rate.  Also, I recently attended the Kelly Strayhorn's own fundraiser, Full Bloom, which was lots of fun.  As a venue, this place is definitely worth your attention, and the staff seems to bend over backward to make sure events go off without a hitch.

"People often mistake PICT for community theatre - this isn't so. PICT, as the name implies performs pieces of Irish and classical theatre seasonally at the theaters of the University of Pittsburgh in the Stephen Foster Memorial (attached to the Cathedral of Learning). Productions are top notch and often sell out so Pittsburgh theatre lovers may find it worth it to buy a season pass.
",1
"PICT is one of the best theater companies in the Pittsburgh area.  The actors are so very talented, and the play selections are smart, thought provoking, and relatively inexpensive.  Do yourself a favor and check out a performance.  You'll definitely be back for more.
",1
"I hate to sound like a broken record but I have to agree with my fellow reviewers: PICT is a wonderful theater and production group! It makes me so proud to see the talent in this city whenever I attend one of their shows. I guarantee you that if you check back each season you'll find at least one show to enjoy. Every year their line-up changes and it always features an incredible variety of shows. I've seen a classics such as ""Antony and Cleopatra"" to the interesting (but potentially uncomfortable) ""In the Next Room (or The Vibrator Play)."" My outright favorite evening with PICT was during a premiere of a play named ""Our Class,"" which was an incredibly shocking but important play about, sadly, real events: a WWII mass murder of the Jewish community living in a town in Poland. No one wanted to speak during or after that show, and the actors handled the roles and portrayal of both inhumane actions and traumatic events incredibly and impressively well. Kudos to them and all of PICT for tackling such an imposing but important project.I have plans to see at least one more if not two more PICT performances this year; not once have they disappointed me, and their contributions to the theater scene in this city are always outstanding. Thank you, PICT!

"I have been a subscriber to the Pittsburgh Opera for 5 years.  I have also attended the opera in other cities, most notably New York City and Sidney, and I feel that we are very lucky to have such an excellent company in Pittsburgh.  The season usually provides lots of variety, and the artistic standards are very high.  The Benedum itself is a magnificent venue to attend an opera, they have done a wonderful job restoring this historic building.  The acoustics of the Benedum are also really excellent.  The super titles are easy to read from just about any seat.  The orchestra is well rehearsed and play beautifully.  I also think that most people have  misconceptions about opera which can be easily be proved wrong by visiting the Pittsburgh Opera.

"Life is a Cabaret, old chum.....You may come out singing ""life is a cabernet savignon"" after throwing back a couple here because, yay, you can drink and eat and eat and drink!I encourage anyone who loves musical theater (or anyone who just likes to eat and drink in a fun environment) to give this place a try!  It's one of my favorite venue's to see a show because it's a whole experience.  There's not a bad seat in the house because it only holds about 200 tables.  Plus they have VIP seating in the front, which provides you with some comfy sofa's to sit on.I'm very excited to see a new caterer come in since the companion restaurant closed next door.  I wasn't too thrilled with the food selections...I really don't know how you make Pizza bad...but they somehow did.  I loved The Big Bang and I Love You, You're Perfect, Now Change.  They honestly do a fantastic job casting the shows.  I have my own personal favorites, it's my own personal fan club of one!Keep in mind there's discounts if you work for certain corporations, you're a student or you come a in group.  Everyone loves a discount!  Go see something so you can stop singing the same Cabaret lyrics over and over again every time you think of the place!

"I had an incredible night here. My wife and I were ""guests"", meaning we had our ticket, food, and drink paid for. This was really nice as we have  a 7 month old at home (amazing how fast they can burn through clothes).However, I have to focus on the actual venue and production. I can honestly say that my wife and I had a blast. We thoroughly enjoyed the topic, the performer, the view from our seats, and the food was very simple and tasty. We encouraged many family and friends to go (some did and were equally impressed) which speaks to the impact the evening made on us. I now keep my eye on what is happening at the CLO and look forward to returning soon.Highly Recommend.
",1
"I have seen quite a few shows here, and every one was a great time. Forever Plaid, Ruthless!, Dixie's Tupperware Party, Forbidden Broadway, to name a few. Always professional and enjoyable. You can order food andor drink, or just enjoy the show. One recommendation: if you are ""height-challenged,"" sit in one of the elevated rows in the back, because the main floor is not sloped.
",1
"We came here to see the play ""You say Tomato I Say Shut Up!"" and what fun we had! The stage is visible from any seat, the waitress was never too far and the food was satisfying. We really had a great time and enjoyed watching a play while eating and drinking. Great time and we can't wait to come back for another show.

"I have been to the CLO Cabaret for several shows and for salsa dancing and have had a great experience every single time.  I love live theater and the CLO offers a fun and unique alternative way to enjoy that experience.  The seating is set up in such a way that there is not a bad seat in the house.  Along the sides you are seated in high bar tables, the middle section is typical table seating and the back of the house is raised on a platform to allow for easier viewing.Most of the shows at CLO are small ensemble casts or only one or two actors.  The way the room is set up, you feel like you know them by the end of the show.  The quality of the productions is fantastic.  I've seen both plays and musicals and the acting, staging and sets have been great for both.  It is amazing what can be done through simple stage sets and props to bring the show to life.  The only down side is that drinks are on the pricey side ($8-9 for a class of wine, $10+ for a mixed drink).  However, you are paying for the convenience of drinking while enjoying a show and the drink prices are pretty comparable to some of the other bars in the cultural district.  I look forward to my next visit to CLO.

"A great, intimate setting to see some local theatre! I went to a performance of Plaid Tidings and really enjoyed the show. You sit at tables rather than the usual side-by-side audience seating and can order drinks and food beforeduring the show.They have a small bar which seemed to get quite overwhelmed during intermission. We had to wait a while to get a drink, but there were a lot of people there all at once, so that is bound to happen.The ushers and other staff were all very polite. I was also impressed by some of their past shows they had displayed on the wall and would definitely go back for another show!

"We are so lucky to have such an amazing theater community in Pittsburgh.  This unique theater adds so much to the mix!  It's a fantastic theater because they focus on plays, usually with one musical in the mix. There's new works here, like the original show The Chief, about what else, but Pittsburgh Steelers founding owner Art Rooney.  They bring in the classics like A Midsummer Night's Dream and The Important of Being Earnest.  They also have newer works right off Broadway, like The Rabbit Hole and Superior Donuts.  Plus, they bring in Second City every year, which is big in my book because they've spawned a couple SNL cast members!! I absolutely LOVE the theater!  I'm a big fan of a theater in the round.  That means there's seating on 3 sides of the stage.  They've also been able to do some really cool things with the stageset, like making an actual pool for the show Metamorphoses.  My favorite all time show was The Secret Letters of Jackie and Marilyn, which was a world premiere.  The show was about a made up relationship between the two women where they wrote letters to each other.  It was a VERY cool concept! They also do a lot of great events like the Mix at 6 for young professionals before a show.  Plus, they understand that most of us under 26 (and of course sometimes above) are broke ho's, they offer $15 tickets!  The great thing is, there's really not a bad seat in the house! Again, we have a fantastic theater district, so TAKE ADVANTAGE and go here!  Don't make me tell you twice!!

"I just saw Superior Donuts! Fantastic show with a REALLY talented cast! This show will definitely go down as a favorite of mine!

"Very cool theater.  Different in that it is modern but still located in the Theater District.  It's easily accessible and in a great location.  Probably the best aspect is the intimacy of the theater.  Only drawback is that any noise made can be heard a long ways...  (i.e. be careful with children)I went to see Electra thanks to Yelp's Culture Month.  The tickets were half price!  Can't be that!  We were 6 minutes late, oops, but the box office was still able to give us our will call tickets and we were lead to watch the performance on a monitor until we could be taken inside.  We were lead inside with 3 other couples while the show was going on.  The only drawback was that we kind of had to just sit wherever (instead of our assigned seats) so as to not make much ruckus.All in all, FANTASTIC performance, and lovely theater.
",1
"We just saw ""As You Like It"" here and we thoroughly enjoyed it. The cast did a great job engaging the audience. It was a long show (two and a half hours) but I was surprised afterwards that it didn't feel nearly that long and kept my attention throughout. My only issue was the difficulty in understanding all of the Shakespearean English, but it was easy to follow the storyline.I think our usher may have been having an off-night. We were led to two wrong sections before we found our seats ourselves. We have been here a few times and have will definitely be back for more!

"This is by far and away my favorite theater in Pittsburgh! If you've ever been here you KNOW how beautiful it is! It's a historic landmark and was built in 1927 and restored in the 80's to it's original state. It holds around 2,200 seats and is the third largest stage in the country. As you can see, I'm a total nerd about this theater.So let me give you some BIG insider tips about seating! Avoid at all costs the outer sides of the Left and Right Orchestra (the floor) in the front. You can actually get a cheap seat if you sit in the back of the Left and Right sides but only sit on the aisle. IF an aisle seat isn't available, go for First or Second Tier. I would rather see the show from far away than half see the show! The touring Broadway, Pittsburgh CLO, Pittsburgh Opera and Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre perform here. So go support our local theater! Just remember it's right here in the burgh, it's still a fantastic production and it's cheaper than a trip to NYC!

"Perfect Valentine's day date experience. I decided to book tickets for the Dracula Saturday Matinee so that we could have a night out on the town after the show. This theater is really exquisite! Prepare to go back in time to the decadence of the 1920's.Marble, sconces, crystal chandeliers, staircases, and brass railings adorn the beautiful space. Take some time after the performance to tour the interior rooms!The ballet was immensely enjoyable in it's own right. The back drops dark, sinister, and ethereal all at the same time. The dancers floating gracefully around the stage as if their feet fluttered just above the ground. Classical music flowed into the hall and moved with the performers during the most intense scenes. It was so romantic. I can't wait to go again!Pricing is quite reasonable too. You can go for the cheap seats for $20 on the top tier left or right of the center. $50 for better seating towards the center or orchestra seating for $90 being the best seat in the house. I love that on the website you can choose your own seats. Parking can be found two blocks away for $5 at the parking garage. Take some time out to visit this theater!

"The Benedum Center for the Performing Arts was originally a movie theater called The Stanley. It was built in 1927 and was billed as ""Pittsburgh's Palace of Amusement."" It's acoustics are nearly perfect because back when it was built, 65 cents would not only buy you a ""photoplay"", but you'd also get live entertainment too. A two year renovation in the late 1980s under the guidelines of the U.S. Department of the Interior brought it back to its original condition. The grand lobby's mirrors and woodwork are all original. Of the more than 90 chandeliers and sconces in the theater, only one is a replica. In fact, the main chandelier weighs 4,700 pounds and is 20 feet high and 12 feet wide. The sightlines here are awesome. It truly is a masterpiece of theater design. Let's face it fellow Yelpers, you're not here for my architectural reviews are you Okay. I came here last night for the Decemberists concert featuring Justin Townes Earle as the opener. There were only single seats left when I tried to get tickets. So I ended up going by myself to the show. Hey a married babe can treat herself to a night out on occasion! The Portland, OR based Decemberists have been burning up the indie rock scene for a few years now and their CD ""The King Is Dead"" has been doing quite well. So much so that it reached 1 on the Billboard Charts in late January. The Decemberists in the past have dabbled in so-called ""progressive rock"" and British folk but this new CD is definitely more of an AmericanaAlt Country sound. So much so that the single ""Down by the Water"" reminds me of Firetown's ""The Good Life"" for some reason (Firetown later evolved into Garbage--in both senses of the word.. But that's another story). So it was no surprise that after doing ""The Crane Wife, Parts 1-3"", Colin Meloy told the audience ""I don't know who wrote the set list, but they thought we were a prog band. We're not a prog band anymore. We're a folk band."" Hmmm! That actually was a pretty apt description. Despite this, they managed to get a lot of songs in from their catalogue. There was plenty of good singin' and good playin' though. Sam Watkins of Nickel Creek played fiddle against Jenny Conlee's accordion and they did a rousing Irish jig to the song ""Rox in the Box"". It was almost strange though how Meloy apologized for taking the tempo down a notch during the gorgeous new song ""Rise to Me"". They also did their most epic pieces in the middle of the show, and face it folks, you can't keep a good prog band down! But anyway, this show proved that the Decemberists aren't some flash in the pan. Their many musical stylings and their abililty to move a show along proves that they're in it for the long haul. I should also mention that my 60-something father, a music fan in his own right, absolutely loves the Decemberists. Now you know where I get those genes from. As I mentioned, Justin Townes Earle opened the show and if his last name sounds familiar, it should. His father is the iconic Steve Earle (another one of my favorites). Justin gets his middle name Townes, from Townes Van Zandt, of whom Steve Earle was a great friend. Justin Townes Earle is definitely more bluesy than his old man and while he seems to be a good performer, only time will tell if he lives up to the musical legacy of his father.

"I always love coming to the Benedum.  We attended Wicked on a recent Sunday night.  I am always astounded by the beauty of this theater.  Here are a couple interesting facts:  The mirrors, marble and woodwork in the Grand Lobby are all original.  There are over 90 crystal chandeliers, torchieres and sconces in the theater, all but one are original.  The original cost was $3 million back in 1928.  Compare that to the 1987 restoration that cost $43 million.  We had perfect seats, Row AA.  How lucky is that  Loved the performance.  My first time for Wicked.  But just as entertaining is the view of theater.  Love it here.  So beautiful and so ornate.  And while the seats are showing some signs of wear, the good news is the 2,881 seats will be repaired and refurbished to the tune of $450,000.You know, it always feels really special here.  No matter what event we attend.  Looking forward to coming back during the holiday season.

"I love it here! It is like walking into a little piece of history, I could see the upper crusts socializing in here back in the day. Furs and fedoras, and those long cigarette holders gracing the hallways. This is a gorgeous theater its hard to capture it with pictures because of lighting glares. I have not experienced large playhouses in other cities. But my advice is pick a show you love a decent Broadway one, splurge once a year it will make your experience that much more memorable. Spend a little extra for refreshments yes they are expensive but again the experience. I don't think the upper seats are bad but some on yelp seem to, if it is what you can afford it is still a nice view. And unlike Heinz hall you have a little leg room. There are always a few audience members behaving naughty that was my only complaint. The ushers are helpful and will let you in if you are few minutes late (Grrr that Pittsburgh parking), speaking of parking I would park at the 9th and Penn garage or the one on liberty and ninth if you can. I appreciate this theater for its history and modern contributions, I think some individuals do not understand that this kind of history in other American cities has been left to decay. Cue in Detroit, sadly. So props to cultural trust or whomever for keeping this one going.... true Pittsburgh beauty,

"I was lucky to get a tour of the Benedum last month, and I was completely impressed.  This is a painstakingly restored historic building with marvelous architectural and design details.  It is absolutely an beautiful place to go see a musical, the opera, ballet, or a concert.  The staff is amazing and extremely professional, they run this place like clockwork.  I love the natural acoustics of the building, although I don't recommend that you sit under the balcony, that's the worst place to hear a good sound.  Don't worry about getting over-dressed for an event at the Benedum, this is a truly unique and beautiful landmark that exudes elegance.

"I've seen several shows and have always enjoyed this venue. Here is the breakdown of the 5 stars given... 1 star for Location- Smack dab in the middle of uptown- an easy walk from my apt. A lot of restaurants are right there so it makes dinner and a show a convenient thing to do. 1 star for Staff- Super friendly and helpful. Whether It's where is the will call line or where is the ladies room You'll always receive a polite response.1 star for Ladies Rooms- I have waited before- but never long. I also like that they have tv's situated everywhere so you don't miss any part of the show if you cannot wait for intermission.1 star for Seat comfort- Roomy enough for me- miles above Ovens arena in my opinion. 1 star Productions- They have great productions and always have a few each year on the line-up that are must-see's! It does everything I need an arts center to do !

"I've loved every venue under their umbrella i.e. Booth Playhouse, Belk Theater, Knight Theater, and Spirit Square. The shows are great and you can find some deals if you visit their website. I've never had a bad time at one of their performances. I did not have a good experience volunteering for them though but this is about Arts & Entertainment.

"This is an awesome cozy venue!!  Get on their email list and see everything they offer!  Hilarious plays (just saw Every Christmas Story Ever Told last night....so funny...these people should really pay me to come and see their shows cause I laugh nonstop!)  They also have cult classic movie nights (like Gremlins!  hilarious!  and free!!)  Decent wine and beer selections and prices.  Go to the website and hunt down the PWYC (Pay What You Can Night) and you can have the chance to see the show for a discount.  If you do this though remember it is first some first serve.  So get there early around 6:30pm and grab a number, when they call your number go and pay what you can (suggested contribution can be around ten bucks).  Awesome spot!

"I love this place!  The shows can be hit or miss (more hits than misses for sure!), but still worth it!  It is a small, cozy, comfortable place that really cares about being local and celebrating that.  They also have lots of fun shows, do a FREE Cult Movie Monday each month, and have many specials.  Check them out for sure!

"I LOVE THIS PLACE!  I personally love musicals, enjoy plays... so my 1st encounter with ATC was when they're showing The Great American Trailer Park Musical in August 2010.  Cmon people, how can anyone pass that up!!  The performance was GREAT.  The stage is small, which turns out to be one of the reason I like this place.  There is NOT a bad seat.  You can see everything.  By the way, seating is not assigned and 1st come 1st serve.  On a hit show, that can be a problem if you want to sit with your honey (or whoever).  Get there early enough to get your choice seating.  Then I found out about the Pay What You Can Night, which is normally a Wednesday.  That night you will get to enjoy the same show for whatever you can scrap up from your couch (or $10 is suggested).  For people who are on tight budget (hmm... me & lots of my friends), it's a great opportunity and I am very very appreciative of it.  (Check their website for PWYC date for each show)  Drinks & snacks (aka chips & cookies) priced reasonably, $3-5 for beerwine, $1 for a snack pack.  Parking is free and plentiful in the lot next to the building.  Since then I've seen 39 Steps (hilarious... though I don't think that's the original intention) and Every Christmas Story Ever Told (not growing up in the US, I totally missed all the references... so not as funny for me).  I am looking forward to Pageant the Musical.

"Support local! I love this place and they have a special showing of all their shows I think at least once a month called 'Pay What You Can Night'.  That's just icing on the cake.  I went here last night with my girlfriend and our friends and I wasn't really looking for anything fantastic in terms of talent or venue.  Boy was I surprised.  Maybe not so much in terms of the venue but the talent was superb.  The staff and opening host of the show were super friendly.  The place really has a grass roots feel to it and I love it.I would suggest anyone to come check out a show here and support this local theater.

"The best show in town right now to see is original Rocky Horror Show. They are doing the 1973 stage production, which the movie was based on and it is FANTASTIC. This ain't your mama's Rocky. The music has a great deal of nuances that are amazing, and the dancing is great. There is always something happening on stage, so I just went and saw it for a second time because I know there were things I missed and I was right.

"I didn't know this theater existed until I went to see their run of the Rocky Horror Show.  It's a great pace with an intimate feel and a good seating layout.  There really isn't a bad seat in the house (unless you have visionhearing problems).  The beer and wine selection at their concession has much more variety than I expected and their box office is a breeze to deal with.  Seriously, how many times can you go see Phantom  Avoid the tired mainstream stuff and check out the edgy shows that ATC is putting together.  You won't be disappointed and you might even expand your horizons.

"This is by far my favorite local theater. I have seen several shows here (Hedwig & The Angry Inch, Rocky Horror Show, The Clean House, The Pillowman, and most recently, CHAPS! A Jingle Jangle Christmas, to name a few.) I always love their performances, and their selections keep me coming back over and over.I have also been lucky enough to meet some of the staff through a mutual friend, and can say that they have the nicest staff imaginable. The theater's success is no doubt due to Dan, Chip, Robert, Mike, Carrie, and Maile.The tickets and concession prices are more than reasonable, but if you're on a budget, check the website for their Pay What You Can nights for each production. Another favorite of mine is Cult Movie Mondays, the last Monday of the month, which is free with free popcorn. Next time you're looking for something to do with your evening, check out what's playing. It will definitely be worth your while.

"I was recently privileged to receive free tickets for myself and a friend to the play, ""The Divine Sister,"" courtesy of Yelp Elite.  I have been a fan of Actor's Theatre for several years.  A big plus for this location is free and easily accessible parking.  It offers snacks and drinks for sale that one can take into the theatre.  Sometimes, they offer beer and wine whose names compliment the theme of that evening's production.  ATC also features Cult Movie Mondays in addition to plays and musicals.  This evening's performance of ""The Divine Sister"" delivered the bawdy, irreverent humor that is characteristic of this theatre.  Another success in a long line of accomplishments.  Thanks to Ben and J.J. for orchestrating a fun and entertaining evening!

"Most Charlotteans don't realize that we have such a fabulous ballet company in residence here in our fair city. It is led by Artistic director Jean Pierre Bonnefoux and his wife Patricia McBride who are world renowned for dancing in the New York City Ballet under George Balanchine. What does that mean for non dance connoisseurs It means young dancers want to come to NCDT from all over the world (literally) to dance under their tutelage which translates to a better experience for patrons.NCDT has always has a great reputation for modern contemporary ballets, but they also excel at classic, storybook ballets like Romeo & Juliet, and funny children's ballets like Cinderella. But their sweet spot (and why they attracted resident choreographer Dwight Rhoden who you may have seen on So You Think You Can Dance) is the innovative contemporary works. In fact their annual Innovative Works in late fall often sells out. It features several short pieces that often have a theme or message.  My favorite piece, Satto, was featured again recently in Director's Choice was originally an Innovative Work. Another one they debuted this year had two male artists partnering with Anna Gerberich and never let her feet touch the ground the whole time. The artists and choreographers ebb and flow but you're always going to see a great show with a wide variety of styles. You may not like every single piece, but at least they're conversation pieces. Similarly, you're not going to love every painting in the Mint. It's worth seeing something other than Nutcracker, so dive in, the water's fine.If I have any complaint, it's that every dancer has a different stylestrength and Jean Pierre seems to have favorite principals that he sometimes over casts. Kind of like John Fox.I grew up watching such dance companies as the SF ballet, Bolshoi, Joffrey Ballet, ODC, Alvin Ailey and the CincinnatiSan Jose ballets so this ain't my first rodeo.Ladies, one more selling point in two words: eye candy. Glistening, muscular athletic men often dancing shirtless. I'm just saying. Sue me.

"You must go see the NCDT. I just saw the fall show limitless and it was incredible. I have enjoyed NCDT for years but this performance was on a whole new level.

"Madison's great historic small concert venue.  Lot's of great bands play here.  I saw Weezer on their Pinkerton Tour with Nerf Herder (remember them The Van Halen Song Yes, I'm that old).
",1
"Arlo Guthrie, Henry Rollins, Toots and the Maytals are just a few of the bands on the line up this month. It's a great place to see a band, and they have good beers on tap too.
",1
"The Barrymore is a great mid-size venue. Great sound, good sight lines, plenty of room to stand up front, and to top it all off, a ceiling of twinkling stars. Parking can be a little tricky, but after going a few times you learn the side streets. Some bands I've seen here include Stars, Bright Eyes, She & Him, Jonny Lang, The Mars Volta, and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs - one of the most memorable shows ever because Karen O. was swilling from a bottle of champagne, fell off the stage, and managed to keep singing the entire time without missing a note or spilling a drop.

"I love this place, I really do! No rail so front row is right on the stage. The ambiance here is great and there's some cool bars and restaurants to hang at before the show. Waiting for a reason to come back. (Umphrey's!)

"Nice and friendly staff.  Their fruit slush is especially good.  It's sweet but not too sweet and the ice they put in there is like fine snow!  We are all fans of the Lychee, Watermelon and Cantaloupe!

"OMG... I totally love this place! I am happy now that I do not have to go all the way to Chinatown for boba, but sad that they don't have more than one location.I order mostly from their milk tea menu, but sometimes get the slushies with milk too---it is not on the menu, but you can definitely order it. The fishballs are soooo good. I ordered them not spicy, but they still have somewhat of a tang to them.The staff is friendly and their service is speedy, but it depends on how many people are there. I have never found this place empty!You gotta go here!Note: Don't forget to get a stamp card! 10 stamps and you a get free boba! :)

"This boba place make my Jasmine Milk Tea like no other. I live 15 minute away from Easy Life Boba Tea, but if I get the craving, then I will do what it takes to get to this heavenly place. It's just that.... UBERSUPERWONDERFULLYDELICIOUS! So worth my hard earn cash (and gas).... so worth it. PERIOD!PS. This is one of the rare boba shop that accept debit cards. Woaaah.
",1
"I've been to Easy Life a good amount of times, due to the fact that I work SUPER close to it, and I have never been disappointed by it.I'm working my way through their menu, today I had a banana smoothie that was very good, not sure if I'd order it again though, I believe it was made with whipped cream in it, which left a weird texture in my mouth...All the teas I've had so far have been really good. AAND you can get different types of toppings instead of just boba....like pudding balls or coconut jelly... And one of these days I'm going to try the Aloe Vera. They also have lobster and squid balls which are really interesting and worth a try!

"Lovely lady in green, you have graced the sides of so many cups of coffee and tea -- I have been unfaithful.  I was lead astray by those Yelpers I've been hangin' with online, and, sweetheart, let me tell you, I'm not going to stop!  Today was just the first!!I tried Boba for the first time today at Easy Life and wow is it good!  I have read the reviews on Yelp for a few weeks now.  Since this isn't too far from home, I was going to stop before, but I'm always going tofrom somewhere and never did stop.I got the coconut white tea with boba.  This is absolutely delicious and I'm still enjoying it as I write this review.  I was such a babe in the woods, I didn't realize I needed the large tube straw.The women working the counter were quite helpful and helped lead me as I strayed from my green lady.I will be back.  This is such a great drink for a day like today that has temperatures above 100.Thanks fellow Yelpers!  And, it's all your fault that I was unfaithful!
",1
"One of my favorite places to get Boba... The location is great because it's in the southwest part of town, open one in the northwest of town and I'll be even more happy! There is a wide variety of different smoothies and teas. You can topping like Boba, lychee, aloe, and more. My favorite is the watermelon slush and green tea slush. Green tea slush with boba and aloe oh man it's so over! They also serve finger foods which are really good but if you order spicy keep in mind they really mean spicy. Lobster balls are my favorite, it is am must try if you never tried it before!
",1
"We frequent Easy Life Boba anytime we are in the area, andor really craving a delicious, refreshing drink!!  I always get the same thing, which is a peach slush, they are great for hot summer days and nights here in Vegas!!  I don't recommend hanging out there in the shop, it is very hot in my opinion!!   Maybe this is just due to the sweltering summer heat...who knows, or by design to give extra incentive to get an ice cold drink once inside  Either way, don't let that persuade you not to try one!!  Definitely a must try for all Boba Lovers out there!!
",1
"How i loved my boba!  They make a great almond milk tea and are pretty cheap!  clean facility, ample seating, and even outdoor available seating for low humidity nights.  They have available punch cards...I believe, buy 8, get one free
",1
"Update*Upgrade to 5 stars - cannot find a better boba (or bubble tea, as I used to call it)!!   And to include in my update:  Lobster Balls!  What are these fried balls o'goodness exactly - I don't care.  Went for medium spicy and I like spicy - don't want to try the really spicy as am afraid I wouldn't get any of the lobster taste.  Great combo with the boba if you want a little bite to eat.

"Mmmmmm!  My boyfriend and I stopped in tonight for ""dessert"" after dinner.  I got the Thai Tea Slush and he got the Coconut Milk Tea.  I kinda wish I would have gotten the large...I was sad when it was gone :(

"this spot HAS to be my favorite place to get boba out here. you would think somewhere in china town would have really good boba, but not so much.as much as i hate parking at town square and just being there in general, i make it a point to stop here whenever i want boba and i know there won't be too much traffic [another plus point - it's right by sephora!]its a small kioskstand in the center of town square. service is always great, even when they're busy. however, the last time i was there she made a small slush instead of a large [good thing i kept my receipt!]. she made another one for me right away, so it wasnt that big of a deal.absolute favorites here - watermelon slush [they use real watermelon, not the fakey syrup] and hawaiin sunset.

"This is by far the best boba in town (unless told otherwise) but i love the original milk tea with boba and lycee jelly (light on the ice please)

"i love lollicup!  why can't one move to honolulu  they make the best peach iced tea ever!!  from now on, whenever i go to vegas i will be sure to stop by lollicup and buy the biggest sized drink!

"Best place for a boba fix! Great milk tea with decent price. Drinks have the right amount of ice and syrup comparing to other Boba places (which give u almost a whole cup of ice with either too much or too less syrup). Location is central in town square and easy to stop by, pick up a drink, and continue shopping or whatnot. Workers are friendly and drinks don't usually take too long to be made and served. Overall, if you are looking for a quick boba fix, lollicup is the place to go!
",1
"I've been here about 5 times already and every time the boba was really delicious. I'm totally pushing the fresh watermelon slush  right now, it isvery refreshing and DELISH!!!!
",1
"I've had some items here that I would easily have seconds on. Lately it's their watermelon cooler, frozen watermelon all blended up and frozen. Fresh watermelon too, I've seen them hauling a bunch of em in by hand. Good stuff for summer or whenever you need some tasty smoothies.

"Great place if you need youre boba tea fix. Always hits the spot.

"Every time I'm at Town Square I go and get a honey milk tea with boba  , so yummythe prices are a bit much for the size of the cup.. but its that good! yes , its really that great..  some time there is a line for all the tourests but it can be fun to just sit and people watch as you sip pure pleasure.

"I just visited this super fun frozen yogurt shop today and I am totally in LOVE!  It is self-serve frozen yogurt that you add your own toppings to.  They have a bunch of flavors to pick from, so you can mix and match.  They also have loads of fresh fruit, chocolate, sprinkles and even mochi & red bean paste to put on your delish frozen yogurt.  After you pick out everything you want, they weigh it and charge you per ounce.  It is a really fun place to go, and it tasted great!I had pineapple, mango and strawberry fro-yo topped with fresh pineapple, mango, coconut, mochi and kiwi.  A word to describe  Scrumdiddlyumptious!
",1
"I am far too obsessed with this place. It has cute seating and the yogurt is delicious. I mostly veer towards the originalCalifornia tart and green tea. I top with blueberries (antioxidants!), mango, kiwi, mochi, andor shredded coconut. Beware of the large cups and the desire to fill the entire thing!! After the first time, I learned my lesson and now I usually leave with a $2-$3 cup of yogurt that satisfies completely!
",1
"Great flavors, great toppings. I always stick to the ""tart"" flavors, plain, California, mango, etc., and usually get mine topped with fruit. The only thing I don't like is that it's ""self-serve"".... So many people not washing their hands, touching the machines, etc. Ahh well.  The tart frozen yogurt is delicious and a healthy addiction! The prices are high too.... But that's typical of other tart fro-yo places; apparently the mix is pretty expensive compared to the 80's style fro-yo.
",1
"Excellent frozen yogurt, huge selection of flavors and toppings.  The best part is that it is self-serve; so you can have as little or as much as you like, as few or as many toppings, etc.Everything is sold by weight ($0.47oz).  A very reasonably sized bowl ended up being about $5.I wish they had one of these in Ames IA!
",1
"Excellent fro-yo, huge selection of toppings and just the right ammount of different flavors to try from
",1
"Ok I have been to a lot of froyo places in Chicago, the suburbs and even out of the states.  Let me tell you nothing beats Cocomero!  The best part about this place is that it's self-serve with fresh variety of toppings.  The design of this place is pretty nice, it seemed like a picture out of an ikea catalog.  I wish my University had this, lucky for UofI students they can get it anytime.
",1
"I've been to a similar concept store in Wheaton. This place seems pricey (some $0.47 per ounce), like that one, but the sheer amount of flavors and toppings is overwhelming compared to other stores like it.I had a lactose-free mango frozen yogurt, and some pomegranate-based yogurt. Both were very good, and I had no complaints about them. There were many other flavors available, including the oddly-named ""European tang"".The toppings included yogurt chips, mochi (!!!), a brownie, very fresh fruit (yes, the mango was ripe) and more. The store design is very bright, very pastel and very smart. I might just be back here tomorrow if I'm craving more frozen yogurt. Hopefully I can try some of the more chocolately or crunchy toppings next time.
",1
"On my recent trip to California I made it a point to get to two froyo places - Pinkberry and Yogurtland.  Despite liking the tartness of PB's original flavor, it just couldn't match up to the variety of flavors, toppings, and the cheap pricing of YL.  Unfortunately, from what I had heard, the only other froyo place with the ""by-the-weight"" model in Chicago was pretty bad.I've known about the one in Champaign for a while but I'd never gone...perhaps due to a fierce loyalty to Jarling's Custard Cup and the Moonstruck that Cocomero replaced.  But, as a lover of froyo I had to see what the fuss was about...Fellow Yelpers, Yogurtland has come to the Midwest.  Tons of flavors, tons of toppings, cheap price, and super happy decor.  And most importantly - it's good.  ESPECIALLY the red velvet froyo.  My friends described my reaction as if I had just saw the love of my life.  In-freaking-tense.  I'm happy I have a Custard Cup alternative to go to if I visit UIUC in the colder months.
",1
"YES, so good. I go to school about 45-60 minutes away and I drove all the way to Champaign for this. OK well I went shopping too.Cocomero is DIY frozen yogurt and I love that concept. There are a ton of different flavors. Pick one or mix and match. They will also give you taster cups, which are really hard to eat yogurt from. I don't get it. Once you have your yogurt, go to the topping bar and choose what you want. They have all kinds of fruit, nuts and candies. I recommend mochi :) Then, you weigh your creation and pay by the ounce ($.47oz I believe). Sit down or take it to go. YUM.
",1
"I've been to about a dozen different froyo places, and I still use Cocomero as my gold standard. Nothing beats this place! The vast variety of flavors, the great taste, the decor, the price -- everything!I'm dying to head back to Chambana just so I can get a mere spoonful of my peach flavored froyo. You would not believe how difficult it is to find that flavor anywhere else, let alone some of their other ones, such as Kahlua and Bailey's Irish Cream. See what I mean by VAST variety of flavors No one else comes close!

"Bubble tea available here!

"A hot summer day and a nice, cool, fresh pearl drink. It doesn't get better than this! It can be tough to find real bubble tea that ISN'T made from that nasty powdered stuff; I have a hard time even amongst the plethora of places in the Bay Area. Jade Mountain's bubble tea is top notch quality, made from actual tea, with love and fluffy, fluffy frothiness on the top. Yum!

"Really good bubbleboba tea! Red is my favorite. They also have stella's bakery scones and spicy cheese bread. Can't wait until winter to try hot bubble tea.

"Went here and tried not to get excited... im from california and i know good boba when i drink it...After my first sip i was immediately satisfied with my green milk tea with boba!!The tea at this place is Taiwanese style which is better then Hong Kong style in my opinion, now if only they can add their famous fried chicken and butter toast to their menu...Word of advise, i like my tea not too sweet and the one they made was perfect for me. However, it is usually a lot sweeter, so if you have a sweet tooth ask for more syrup!
",1
"I ordered a black milk tea for under 3 bucks which it's totally reasonable price. It tasted pretty good...you can tell it's made fresh with real tea - none of that powder crap. It's not as richcaffeinated as HK style milk tea (what I'm used to in the bay area) but I would definitely come back here to satisfy my milk tea craving. Very comfortableclean seating area and the cashierowner is very polite (handed my change back with both of his hands!) Too bad it's so far away.

"Great food, drinks and environment! Love the bubble tea and potstickers.

"Jade Mountain is a great little place and I'm really happy to have it in my neighborhood. I've only ever had their bubble teas but they are quite delicious. Quite often then tapioca bubbles have just been freshly prepared, and recently I've noticed that they have other options like lychee jelly. For that matter, It seems like every other time I go back there is some kind of new tea flavor or variety on the menu.On top of the tasty drinks the staff is always super friendly and the environment is relaxed and comfortable. Great place to hang out on a lazy Sunday.
",1
"This place is great! The prices are super reasonable and the tea is just how I like it-- not too sweet, with great tea flavor. I wish I lived in Madison so I could get bubble tea here all the time! It's a great place to hang out for a bit; you can get your drink in a glass if you want to drink it while you're there. The owners are really friendly!
",1
"Their milk teas are perfect. Very subtle flavors with just the right amount of sweet and milkiness to tea ratio. I think they blend their teas rather than shake, but it comes out tasting smooth, refreshing, and cool. I also appreciate they keep their indoor temperature at normal levels. Who wants to be ice-blasted by the air-con I can actually wear a t-shirt inside, rather than have to bring a sweater with me on a hot summer day. Or, I can sit outside on their cute furniture with my cool drink. They're a bit of a ways from campus, but whenever I'm in the area I try to stop by and support this unique find in Wisconsin.
",1
"I cannot possibly say enough nice things about this place.  Their bubble tea is delicious - real tea, lightly sweetened tapioca pearls; sweet and refreshing and never cloying.  I particularly recommend the red milk bubble tea.  I've tried bubble tea other places since Jade Mountain opened, but nothing else compares.Their chicken and pork pot stickers are perfect snack food, and the pork ramen is excellent - better than Umami's at half the price.  They have a tendency to run out of the various food items on the menu, but there's usually an equally good alternative available.Throw in friendly staff, casual atmosphere, good prices, wifi, and a rewards program, and Jade Mountain is well worth my commute from the west side.
",1
"I can't stress enough how great this place is.  I've been coming here regularly since I discovered it last winter and will continue to do so. The first thing I noticed about this place was their great customer service.  The workers are always friendly - especially the owners - and you can tell that they try to get to know a lot of their regular customers.  They're also very helpful in answering any questions about the teas and can give recommendations.  Thumbs up on the milk tea, mountain tea (a really unique and great taste), coffee and the fruit teas.  The little desserts are a nice touch and the one I've tried was good.  Their steamed buns are good as well.The only thing I wouldn't recommend is the pork ramen.  My friend and I both tried it and neither of us liked how fatty the pork was.  The ramen is okay but I probably wouldn't order it again for the price.  But overall I find their prices to be very reasonable.

"At first, I thought Bosa had only in a couple locations in the valley, but after we moved to Central PHX, I've realized that Bosa has become a DYNASTY.I have always had a passion about donuts. Even when I was at my peak health, there was room for donuts.Bosa just does it right, the Cinnamon Crumb is clearly the best donut, but even the cake donuts rock. (Please dont' make me regret recommending this flavor, leave one for me from time to time, friends)Coffee is usually quality, and black as night. The Dunkin's in the area seem to have a real problem with consistency, but not the case w BosaI too look forward to trying their take on Boba Tea, but it's gonna be hard to beat The Street.Take it from a guy who could put away a dozen donuts, but has the will to eat just one at a sitting... Why waste your calories on crappy cakes, candies, etc, Donuts are the way to go.

"BUBBLE. TEA. Bubble tea bubble tea bubble tea.(Can you tell I love bubble tea Seriously, it's like a drink and a snack all in one.) I first tried bubble tea at Bubble Island in University SquareEast Campus Mall, and since that went south, I've been searching for bubble tea. And then Steepery came, and I found it. Of course, there are other things to love about Steepery too - mainly the multitude of flavors they offer as add-ins. Where else in the central downtown area can you get a lavender chai latte Also, Steepery's refreshingly tech-savvy for a local shop - they've got an iPad cash register, Belly rewards app, WiFi, all that fun stuff.Only thing I don't like (and this may have changed since the last time I was there) No gift cards. Instead, they do it by pots of tea - you can buy 10 pots, 20, etc. I'd prefer a traditional dollar-amount gift card option, if they haven't started doing it already.EDIT: Five stars, five stars - they do sell gift cards!

"This is semi new, they've been open for at least the last month or so. But it seems no one has really come out and checked it out. It's located on Ft. Apache and Tropicana to the left of Tropical Smoothie or Mashisoyo. The sign says ""Grand Opening Homemade Ice cream and Boba"", it doesn't have a name on the signs yet so it's hard to see it. All the ice creams are all homemade and made right there in the shop. The prices are not bad at all, for a single scoop it is $2.50, double scoop $3.50, and every extra scoop is another $1. They have many flavors, if you look at my picture you can sort of see the menu (I'll update a little later). The Asian flavors are what stuck out to me the most. They allow free sampling of the flavors, so yes I did try them all and actually liked all of them. One flavor that's not on the menu itself is Durian, but if you ask for it, they'll give it to you. Now this was the first time I ever had Durian, and it was delicious (now I have to try the actual fruit). I've heard it was either a hit or miss with Durian as some people really hate it or really love it. The flavors aren't imitation which you can easily tell after taking a bite into it. I haven't tried the Vegan ice cream yet, but it's non-dairy and it's worth a shot if you're lactose intolerant or vegan. They have waffle cones  bowls which is only an additional 50cents!They have milk tea, slush, and hot tea which all the prices are very fair.They have a stamp card for the boba drinks buy 5 get one 1.I'm not going to take off for service, but I've had some bad run-in's with their service. Owner going on vacation and they close, but when asked for a return date, they either don't know or give me the wrong date. As I love the ice cream I came back several times when they said they were going to be open, to bring my mother who is visiting from out of the country, and they weren't open or were rude. The owner while he was working did not acknowledge me at all while in the store, only acknowledged my friend, which was rather rude. But I'm willing to give him another shot. If I based this review off of service I would only give them 1 star as it was a major disappointment. But alas, the ice cream is well worth it to me.
",1
"I love all the Asian Flavors that they have, especially Durian ice cream! Their ice cream is freshly made at the store and the owners are exceptionally friendly. They offer samples and do not get annoyed when you want to try multiple samples. In addition to all their wide variety of flavors, they are also one of the few places that offer vegan ice cream too! Currently they have vegan vanilla, chocolate, and mango. They are open to making more flavors if there is a demand for them. I love supporting our local small businesses! =D
",1
"Putting aside the fact that when i first went, they had some bad impressions (owner on vacation, closed shop for over a week, no ingredients to make ice cream to replenish stock, etc). If i based the review on that only, i'd probably give them 1-2 stars. But i gave them many chances to recover.Located on the SW corner of Tropicana and Ft Apache, next door to Tropical Smoothie (take note the address from yelp, on more than one occassion, has led the person to the area down the street). Easy way to get to this place would be turning right at the Hobby Lobby sign on Ft apache, and then taking a left. I had first heard about this place from a friend, saying they had durian ice cream. i was ecstatic to hear this news and been waiting a LONG time to try this place. There are 3 different ""areas"" of ice cream. First is the normal type containing like chocolate, banana chocolate, pistachio, etc. Second is the asian type containing green tea, lychee, taro, black sesame, ginger, mango, durian, and guava. Last but not least, something catered to the lactose intolerant, 100% non-dairy ice cream, with flavors of i believe vanilla, chocolate, and mango All the ice cream is made by the owner himself, Peter Wong. He lets you try as many flavors as you want, and he gives you a decent amount (way more than other places for samples). Something good to note is all the ice creams are not overly sweet. They are sweet but very fragrant. All of the ice cream are soft, and very smooth. I've tried most of the asian flavors, including some of the normal, and one of the non-dairy style. Starting by my favorite type, asian flavors ! My least favorite is probably the ginger. There is a slight spice from the ginger that you can taste. Nothing spicy but its like a subtle but noticeable spice. The taro is one of the lighter ones as well. Fragrant , light, with very small taro bits. No artificial coloring (not deep purple like you see in stores, but like very very light purple).The mango and lychee are nice. Sweeter, but fragrant depending on the fruit. The guava (new) is nice. Really fragrant, not too sweet. Out of the ""ordinary"" asian flavored ice cream. The last two is black sesame and durian (so i just noticed ive never tried green tea... hmm) first the black sesame. Made with actual ground black sesame. VERY fragrant. Slightly sweet. Its like the ice cream version of the hot black sesame soup dessert. i love it ! And last but not least, durian. BE WARNED. this is one of the asian fruits where you either will love it, or hate it. It has a very distinct flavor and smell. This is my favorite, along with the black sesame. the durian has a light yellow color. Gives off the actual durian fragrance that you'd expect from the fruit. Same for the taste as well. Very fragrant, slightly sweet. As for the normal flavors, i havent had the chance to try yet, ive been stuck on the asian flavors, but when i visited today, Peter let me try a new creation of his, which was the banana chocolate chip. He said its made with real bananas ! this flavor was really fragrant in terms of the banana. not too sweet either. Honestly, almost rather prefer it without the chocolate chip. the chocolate chip makes it kind of weird Now last but not least, something a lot of places dont offer. 100% non-dairy ice cream. When i had first visited this place, my uncle was complaining about not being able to try any because of his lactose intolerance. Luckily, Peter just created (that day..) something new. 100% non dairy ice cream. My uncle was super happy. Peter was very careful, made sure to not use a scoop that was prior used in the other ice creams. As i had said earlier, there was 3 flavors he had made. When he was getting a sample for my uncle, he said the ice cream was made earlier, and has not completely set yet, but because its been maybe 1-2 hours since freezing process started, there are some areas he was able to get that was solidified. I forgot which flavor was tasted but the texture and flavor was good. Of course its not as fragrant as if using normal dairy products, but it was still good for what it is. Flavorful, semi sweet, and of course, smooth. Highly recommended place for ice cream. Prices are very good as well.Starting at $2.50 for 1 scoop up to $5.50 for 4 scoops. They aren't small scoops either ! :D

"It took two attempts to come out here before I was able to try Perfect Scoop. Give them a call before you head over. Besides the after school crowd, their business is not steady throughout the rest of the day and they tend to close early. The second note; they make all of their ice creams fresh and will run out of the fun ones. I had my heart set on durian or black sesame, but both flavors were out. Instead my sister and I shared the pink guava and lychee. Both these light and sweet fruits complimented each other well. We ended up taking a little of both in each bite. If a bolder flavor was paired with either, their subtle characteristics would have been masked.All of their flavors are made in house with no added colors or preservatives. The scoops are generous. The staff are warm and gracious. All of these components made the disappointment of not getting what I came for bearable. Just call ahead of time to see if they are open and fully stocked.

"So I'm going to tell you exactly why I gave this place 5 stars.1star: Customer service. The filipino lady working here is pretty awesome. I came in with 3 other friends and of course we asked for samples. :P She pretty much gave us a scoop of all the flavors that we wanted to try. Honestly, we could've had our fill from just the samples but they were just too freakin good. She was patient and took the time to chat with us which I really appreciated.2star: Flavors. This is no ordinary ice cream shop with your typical vanilla chocolate.. its EXOTIC. By exotic I mean, pink guava, black sesame, durian, taro, lychee, mango, green tea, etc etc. No where else in the Las Vegas valley have I found these flavors at an ice cream shop. ANNNNNDDD all are hand made by the owner. What I liked most about it was that all the flavors weren't overly sweet.. you mainly got the flavor. 3star: Price. Cheap cheap cheap. 1 scoop was about $2.50 and the prices go up from there. They also offer waffle bowls and other toppings and you can also get a pint to take home for less than $5 bucks. Thats freakin awesome.4star: Atmosphere. Though the shop is small, there are table and chairs. The lady honestly didn't mind us sitting for half an hour just chatting. In fact, she even came and chatted with us. I can definitely see this as a hang out spot to meet with friends over some ice cream and boba. Especially during the summer time. 5star: Just because I feel like it. They are great!!!Please don't let this place die!! This ice cream shop needs to stay open forever!!!** My favorite was the black sesame
",1
"The best black sesame ice cream ever. I had a scoop there and wanted a pint to go. Unfortunately there was only enough for one more scoop. So I took it.
",1
"This place is amazing! One of the best impressions of a place from the beginning.The lady that works there is so nice and even opened the place early (an hour before it was supposed to open) when we were waiting outside to realize that it wasn't opened yet. In addition, she gives samples if you ask to try. And she doesn't gip you off the samples either. She lets you try what you want and is very patient and welcoming. The Asian flavors are so unique! Probably the only place I know that makes such interesting flavors from durian, pink guava, black sesame, green tea, lychee, mango, red bean, ginger to taro. What is even more special is that the lady that works there along with her business partner make the ice cream themselves. You can definitely taste the different of homemade ice cream.The price is really good deal for the portion. One scoop is 2.50, two scoops 3.50, and a pint for 4.50. I generally am against having anything durian due to its smell. However, if you get past the first 'impression' of the durian ice cream, it is really good. It has the durian ice cream with a mix of vanilla ice cream I think. I had tried it during the sample, and decided order it as one of the scoops of two.Black sesame is by far my favorite there. If you have had the Chinese sesame balls in sweet soup, it taste exactly like that except in cold form. It is creamy and not too sweet like other ice creams. And if you are person who likes ginger candy or like the taste of ginger, ginger flavor is definitely a must-try. It does have a strong ginger flavor like durian ice cream, however, if you can get past that first impression, it has a rather soothing aftertaste.Also, if you are a person who doesn't want to try the Asian exotic flavors, they do have many other flavors to try.Furthermore, this place is really cozy and the owner was willing to let us hang out there and catch up with friends. The lady that worked there even came up to us at one point to chat with us. Last but not least, this place is not just for ice cream. They do sell various drinks as well. Definitely will come and try other flavors here again.

"Who eats ice cream in the dead of a Vegas winter I do and I'll keep coming back for more, all year round. Props to Mr. Wong for making such delicious ice cream flavors with fresh ingredients, especially the Asian ones! Love that they have the typical green tea, lychee, mango, taro, and red bean, but the ones that stand out is the black sesame, ginger, and the infamous durian. Coming from someone who almost kicked a friend out of the car for drinking a fresh durian smoothie, I have to say that their durian flavor is the only exception I'd make for the spiky, smelly fruit.Their prices are so reasonable given the small mountain of ice cream they give you! Dishing out the $3.50 for two huge scoops is a bargain, given how they make the ice cream in house. You could get a pint here for $4.50, and it'd be better than the stuff at the Asian markets.The Filipina lady seriously reminds me of my mom (in a good way, I promise). Friendly, generous, and personable! She served up a sample equivalent to a whole scoop of all the requested flavors for my three friends and I to split. Not only that, but she was genuinely interested in getting to know us too. Almost felt like I was at home there. How often does that happen these daysYou might get brain freeze while enjoying their cheap, chilly treats, but trust me, you won't get the cold shoulder here.
",1
"Finally tried their ""non-Asian"" flavors and Perfect Scoop is still pretty solid. Tried Killer Chocolate and Espresso during my second visit and damn, it's freakin' frackin' good! I'm itching to come back and try their ginger flavor. I don't even care if it's 40-30 degrees out, the cold won't stop me from devouring their ice cream. I know they offer other stuff like boba drinks, but for now I plan on trying all of their ice cream flavors. I'm glad a business like this exists here in the valley. I love privately-owned establishments compared to chains. The attention to detail and quality is definitely better. The Filipina lady is charming and very accommodating. Just like Jaimie Y said, she reminds you of that aunt (or in her case, her mother) that is willing to feed you whenever you come to visit or something. NOT TO MENTION THEY HAVE VEGAN ICE CREAM!! I'm not strictly on a vegan diet but this option is quite nice.
",1
"I got to try a lot of different flavors as I kept going back, I tried all their Asian flavors, I'm not a fan of the ginger it's a little spicy and not what I expect from ice cream, but they added ginger candy into the ice cream which has a nice flavor. The taro was light, I couldn't really taste much of the taro in it, but it was still good and fragrant. The guava was good too, it was made from pink guava, really light in color, but really good, I loved it enough to take some home. The green tea is good too, tastes a lot better then the ones you find in other stores or prepackaged ones, tastes just like the ones I find in Japan. Black sesame is sweeter then the rest, at least to me it is but it's still really good. The regular flavors I've tried a bunch of them and they're all good, not so sweet as I would find american ice cream to be, but there is still a sweet sense to them all. One that stood out was the banana chocolate chip, but I don't like the added chocolate chip to the banana ice cream, but it's still good. I would actually like to see just banana ice cream by itself.

"Omg!!. Where do I start!!. The most moist, fresh and fluffy donuts I've ever had.. At all times of they day, you'll find fresh donuts here. Staff is super friendly.. This shop is the real deal and a must go for Donut enthusiast.
",1
"Good donuts.
",1
"Oh, man... AZ Donut Co is the best worst thing to ever happen to me. These donuts are by far some of the best in the valley (especially when you get them fresh) and they're right down the street from my house, so... well, I'm a regular now and I eat far too many donuts!!
",1
"There are several great aspects to this company. First, I'll start with the downfall... because I can only think of one. The wait at the drive-through is extremely long, it could be sped up quite a bit because it doesn't actually save time from what it would take to park and walk in. I was the only customer in the drive-through, after placing my order I spent about 5 minutes waiting at the window -- longer than expected, but tolerable.However, on the plus side there's a DRIVE-THROUGH.  Although it may take less time to just park and walk inside, the benefit of having a drive-through is that you don't have to get ready in the morning or late at night. The drive-through and shop are open 24 hours a day...how many more ways can I say ""amazing""Next - I love boba tea and usually have to drive 20 minutes to Chandler for a decent one from Boba Tea House in Lee Lee's market place complex. Not anymore! This place also sells my favorite taro milk tea. Finally, not only was the staff extremely friendly (almost overly friendly, but in a positive way), the donuts are delicious and fresh -- I'd recommend this place over the big chains (Dunkin Donuts, Krispy Kreme) any day! Extremely cheap, but be aware: They will not accept credit or debit cards for purchases under $3.  5 stars in my book!
",1
"Only two data points--Old Fashion and Glazed Crumb. The former was excellent, the latter fantastic!Gotta get back.
",1
"Best donuts and best price in town!!

"Oh sweet late night heaven.Located where the old KFC used to be on Broadway and Beck across from Palo Verde, this place is a late night dream. Their drive thru is open 24 hours. I rolled thru and was actually taken aback by their extensive menu. After a few minutes of debating w myself, I decided on the vanilla cake and Boston creme. The lady who was working the window was probably the nicest person Ive ever dealt w at a drive thru. She seemed genuinely happy to be there. In minutes I had my donuts and was on my way home.And they were go-od. Cakey and gooey and delicious and *Homer Simpson drool*.Dont be surprised if they dont have the vanilla cake when you go in, I was told they run out of it all the time.
",1
"I drive by it all the time on my way to work so last Friday I stopped in. The staff was super friendly which is a stark contrast from the fast food joints I usually get iced coffee from. I ordered a ham and cheese croissant combo, the price with an iced coffee was cheaper than any fast food place and the doughnut holes! Yummy! It has that mom and pop feel and the staff was perky!
",1
"I found out about Donut Co. through an admenu and decided to make a midnight run. I noted it was within relatively easy biking distance of the ASU campus, which was exciting since I've been looking for a donut shop that can fit that distinction. I asked my friends to choose which donuts they wanted off of the menu I found and despite the late hour at which I went there was an ample amount of each kind to pick from.The donuts themselves were soft and tasted fresh, particularly the donut holes. I didn't heat them up when I got back since my friends didn't have a microwave in their dorm room, but I'm sure they would have tasted even better warm. And better than their donuts was their boba tea, the special signifier for my 5 star rating.I went for a taro flavored boba smoothie, which I've had before at other boba tea establishments. While I usually enjoy taro smoothies, the way they prepared theirs made it possibly one of the most delicious things I've ever had the pleasure to drink. The taste was akin to the scent of a pumpkin spice candle, but in creamy purple smoothie form. They didn't skimp on the tapioca either. Absolutely perfect drink, even on my chilly bike ride back to my dorm. Cannot recommend this place enough for fans of boba tea.The cashier was friendly and attentive, particularly for a late-night employee. Absolutely wonderful shop.
",1
"These very well might be the best donuts in the Phoenix area!  Great price, helpful and happy service.  Great variety (even though I arrived at 4:30 PM) and all items were light, fluffy, delicous, fresh, and not too sweet.  Worth every bite!

"Great local place to go for bowling, and enjoy time with friends and family, summer time is nice to sit out on the patio have a few drinks with friends and watch some volleyball...
",1
"We were trying to find somewhere cheap with some decent food in the Madison area. After reading some not so great reviews we decided on this promising joint. It was a short drive from where we wanted to head afterwards and they're cool with you leaving any cars in their parking lot for any amount of time, even overnight.The bar was definitely top notch, especially for a bowling alley. The food was fantastic.  Great sandwiches and burgers, appetizers, and more variety than you'd expect from a venue of this sort. Fast, friendly service topped it all off. Bowling is super SUPER cheap on Mondays and most weekdays. Standard fare as that goes; plenty of lanes and balls to choose from. And to those who make a big deal about them borrowing a shoe, grow up. Highly recommended for some fun with friends or just a few drinks.
",1
"I go for the bar, food, and people. Can't say I have bowled there but I do frequently visit. It's a good bar to stop in and just relax for a bit. Patio is nice in the summer time, plenty of room to just relax with friends or family. The staff keeps me coming back. Kitchen can be hit or miss depending on who's cooking. But for the most part your bartenders will work with you. Enjoy some darts, pool, volleyball, or some bar dice. Overall, since I moved here it is like a hidden gem that reminds me of home. Defiantly worth a visit

"Great instructors and staff!

"I had my wedding here. They were great we had correspondence throughout the entire planning phase. However they don't offer many services for weddings. We had to find our own DJ, Photographer, Officiant, ect. However they cater there so we had limited choices on what we can choose from. There is no way to taste test the food prior to your selection either. Same for the Cake they make them there but they only offer whipped cream frosting and fresh flowers to put on top, bring your own topper and ribbon to put around the cake as well. I had my wedding upstairs where the lighting is not to good either. But I have to say my friends and family loved the place, they are still telling me on how that was the best and most fun wedding they have ever been to. So for the price this place is the best! But be prepared to do quite a bit of the work yourself, its not an all inclusive package like you can get at some other places around the valley. But to do it all over again I would still pick this place.

"I used to go here up until I was seven years old. Then my family moved to Boston.First, the wave pool is completely amazing to a little kid growing up in Arizona, a kid who may have never seen waves before! And the waterslide was scary as hell, but awesome when I got up the nerve to go down it.And then there are the ducks around the manmade Arizona pond. I loved all those ducks and one time this duck let me put him on his lap and I pet him and he just stayed there! I looked for that awesome duck each time I went back to the park afterwards, but never found him again.

"So glad Tempe has an area like this... a few miles down Mill and you feel like you're in another town. Nothing but green everywhere and water..love it!!Went to the batting cages... for $1.25 you get 14 pitches... you got pools...lake..basketballtennis courts you can even pay to join games i believe..just an all around cool place for some physical activities. And cheap at that!

"Suk in the Fitness Center was a treat to work with. He cared about making fitness a lifestyle habit and something you could continue with long term. The gym itself is nice, plenty of circuit and cardio equipment, as well as some free weights. What made it five stars though was Suk checking in on you in your workout when she was around.  Thanks!

"Worth every penny! It's so nice to be able to swim without being out in the heat. I have a pool and still go here a couple times a week. Be careful with small kids though, the waves pack a punch.

"Recommend to family & friendsIf you are in Tempe, you must visit Kiwanis Park. This is such a beautiful park. Not only is it beautiful, family and friends would love it here for the weekend fun or holding an event. My first visit was when the boyfriend and I visited his house, located in Tempe and walking distance to the park. I fell in love with the park. There's a lake and a long sidewalk for runners out there. Best weather to run would be during the fall in the evening. Apparently it's still warm during the fall here, no surprise since we're talking about Arizona, desert state right Haha...What will catch your eyes The lake! Who would imagine desert like Arizona would have water! I didn't... haha. Great place to bring your kids and family here on the weekends of after your meals just to walk around and breathe. What caught my eyes were the sign that says 'crossing ducks' http:www.yelp.combiz_photoscSVmQusncacVHsCHObA1Ggselect=FeK9GKxNBVIGdQlp-FASFwFeK9GKxNBVIGdQlp-FASFw Made me smile :)Take a look at the website : http:www.tempe.govindex.aspxpage=774there's many activities you can do with your family and friends. Oh my, did I mention There's a wave pool inside of the recreation center! You heard me! Wave pool! How cool is that :D There's also a fitness center (might need to be a member), tennis court, volleyball (my favorite!), batting cage, and some rentals (ask them for specific rentals). Seriously can spend a day here. Make sure to watch your children if you are walking near the lake because there is no barrier. Keep your kids by your side just for safely. There are ducks and probably random fishes in the lake. You can fish at the lake, but I wouldn't suggest to take the fishes home to eat. D: So glad this park is just 5 min walk from his place in Arizona. Will come back, maybe next time I'll bring my dog. :)

"Who really knew how amazing this park is It is a mecca of fun and good times.They offer so much here, it is hard to cover it all.They have a great little man made water way inside on the Mill Ave side. IT is a giant pond,you can take little water crafts on it.  It has ducks and fish as well. They also have a lot of covered Picnic areas with grills so you can have Birthday Parties and such. All well lit also. Along with clean(as clean as you can get for a park) toliet areas. Lots of rolling hills for exercise or to bring your dog.Our dog loves coming here. It is like disney land for her.On the other side is the grat wave pool, and a great gym. The park offers all sorts of classes and sports leauges for all ages.Lots of places for kids to play.It is just great! The only thing I am not crazy about is on the weekends they sometimes also parties and get togethers here that drive me nuts. Because, the music will start early in the morning and go all night.It can really be loud at times even with your doors and windows closed.Unfortunatly I live close enough to hear it. But, if you have kids or dogs, it is a lot of fun and a great place to explore.

"The more I come to this park the more I like it.It has every thing you could want for so much fun! The other day I was there and they had horses there. Doing maneuvers! They were Police horses ,that was so cool.It is a huge place with so much to offer.It has a wave pool, and a huge man made pond. In there you can fish, and boat, or just sit and enjoy the water.Bathrooms are,well park kind. I do not use unless I absolutely have to, but at least they have them.Lots of areas for parties and get togethers. I do not know if you have to get a permit for that, but you can check their website.Lots of places to park and you can ride bikes all around in there as well.

"I must start this by saying I am spoiled. Ever since I moved to Tempe in 2008, I lived super close to Tempe Town Lake. I was in love with running at that park, but now I live on the south end of Tempe and TTL is really not convenient in the morning rush hour traffic. Once I discovered that Kiwanis was basically my ""down the road neighbor,"" I have been going regularly. I love to run in the mornings with my dog before the weather gets too hot for him. I think Kiwanis may just be his new favorite place because he loves to chase ducks! This park, while much smaller than TTL, has a ton of ducks, fish, turtles and other types of birds that call the lake their home. You see people with nets and fishing poles out there fishing all times of the day. There is also a huge playground for kids, many pavilions and grills for family get togethers and sometimes they play a movie on a big projection screen in the park. If you're an outdoorsy person, definitely check out Kiwanis Park!

"Kiwanis has everything a rec center needs to be considered one of the best. Right to the point, if you ask me. I'll cover it all, but regardless of age, they have all the bases covered. Lets dive into Kiwanis (we can dive into the wave pool later!)~What To Do~What can't you do If you are a child, they offer sports classes up the ying yang like the non-competitive program Sportball all the way to fun swimming classes in the huge pool, no matter the skill level. For adults, the tennis courts are outstanding, as is the fitness room too! Finally, for the older crowd, they have many fun programs available for you to stay active and happy!~The Good~I really feel that to be a true RECREATION center, you have to be able to provide a large variety of programming for the masses. Kiwanis, in my eyes, offers just that and more. They offer the largest variety of programming I have found in the valley. With me personally being a sports coach, I have been to many city rec centers, and no center is the same. This center is at the top of the food chain. They also offer a batting range, A BATTING RANGE. Do this equation: Batting Range + Wave Pool + Gym + Tennis Courts + Awesome Staff = Bonkers Good Facility. Just stop by with your child, sit down to the left and look through their program guide....you will see the breadth of their course offerings..then you will see the huge wave pool behind the desk and be sold!~The Bad~It is an older facility, and being so, there are some visible areas where they could do some minor renovations. However they just re-did the bathrooms and also touched up the walking areas near the softball fields, so you can't say they aren't trying. My biggest complaint is parking, which is situated in bulk on the opposite sides of the center. It makes for a relatively long walk no matter which side you park on. They have a minor row of parking right up front, however if you come anytime really after open on a weekend, don't bother trying to find a spot up front. In the hot summer months, that can be a bit of a nuisance, but really that is worst it gets here....parking... haha :-)~The Down Low~This is my favorite center to teach at. I prefer it over all others. It is the largest, has more options than others, has spacious grass to frolic on (I said 'frolic' in a review, life is complete now), and the staff here are extremely helpful and courteous each time I converse with them. Like I said earlier, just come down and grab a pamphlet with programming info, you will be very happy. Message me if you have questions about programming, I am glad to help!!!

"Geeze this park is huge my boyfriend and I were looking for a birthday party today for almost a half an hour. No ones fault though we just didn't know where to go. We finally met up with our friends and had a great time. There was a lot of shaded areas around the park some huge ponds, I think I saw people walking with poles so fishing definitely would of been a fun thing to do. The kids loved feeding the ducks but we had to watch out for those 4 seater bikes. The park rents out those and cute little paddle boats.

It wasn't as crowded even for a 4th of July weekend. You can bring up to 4 people into the recreation center for only $5 per person per day. Not bad. The recreation center has a pool and water slides. It's like your own mini water park there. Lots of tables, chairs and shade area. Really big pool. I was very impressed. They also have indoor basketball courts, badminton, Tennis courts, weight room, Pool Hall and workout rooms. It was really nice. Also the area is beautiful. Very green and well kept.

"One of the perks of living here is that we have a great Recreation Center called the R Club. The R Club has numerous amenities from a resort style pool, water slide park, lap pool, outdoor basketball, tennis and beach volleyball. Inside there is a decent gym with lots of cardio equipment, free weights, and cross training machines. There is also an indoor basketball court and racquetball court. For residents, all of this is free of charge and as the other review stated, for guests, its a nominal $5 fee. For such a large community, I'm actually surprised that more residentsguests don't use the Rec Center, but I guess it's a good thing so it's not crowded all the time.

"I love the recreation center at Rhodes Ranch. When you arrive it looks like a hotel! The plants, the floor, the furniture, basically the interior is really nice. If you do not live in Rhodes Ranch then you have to be brought in by someone that does. They sign you in and you have to pay $5 to get in. Inside of the recreation center there's a gym, dance room, basketball court, racket ball rooms, game room, kitchen, basically everything. I love the gym the most. There are a variety of machines, weights, and balls to choose from. There is also air conditioning, two tv's, and mirrors. The game hall is also nice. You can play pool and ping pong. There is also a water park that's a part of the recreation center. I honestly think it's better than Wet N Wild to be honest. Very kid friendly and it gets you wet for sure!

"Awesome awesome awesome. You walk in the gate and there is an area to lock up bikes. The pool is large and inviting. There is a large resort style pool, a spa, a lap pool and the splash zone (kid area). The kid area is a small wet and wild- these kids nowadays are damn lucky to have this during the summers. They have lounge chairs and a couple areas of shade to relax. Downside : no booze allowed! The inside has a nice sitting area with a tv and fireplace. They have rooms you can rent for parties and also a bunch of ping pong and pool tables. The rest room has lockers (bring your own lock), a steam room room and showers. There is an area for dance, a huge basketball court, racquet ball courts and a small gym. I have never had a problems getting machines. They only stay open till 9 but it makes me get in there sooner. They have vending machines with cold drinks if you get thirsty after your workout. It Is free for residents, new residents must get your photo taken and they will issue you a resident Id. $5 for guests to use facilities all day. The rec center is a huge selling point for this community.

They will mow down just about anyone,  including the handicapped and the elderly.and 15 minute parking should be enforced! There's signs up, but so many people abuse it.

"Soo my husband and I were looking for a place with an indoor pool! And I found this place on yelp! We checked it out and it was huge! They had an indoor track, indoor basketball court, indoor and outdoor pool, rock climbing, and they also do activity a for the kids (all different ages) and adults there. Zumba, cooking classes, karate, swimming classes, and even classes for the little kids i think 11months and up (I was happy about that bc my daughter is 14 months). Anything you could possibly think of they do it there! Yes this place is pretty popular soo expect it to be PACKED with people. :p

"Very clean for the most part. I use the indoor pool on a daily basis and I do find some bugs on occasion, Im sure it is because they leave the doors open which I don't quite understand but whatever. Locker rooms are kept very nice and usually smell clean at 5am. I hate germs and am very paranoid but they take care of the facility. Staff is pretty friendly & helpful. Lifeguards seem to be high school students which kinda worries me if someone were to have an accident but I suppose they have had proper training.Overall its a good place.

"Great Swim classes, events, and dance class. We have a 4 and 2 year old so we are here almost every week!

"This place is great!  I've had my daughters take tumbling classes, my son do the seasonal sports and all five of my kids have used the swimming facilities.  It's affordable, safe, and diverse enough that we all look forward to trying the different classes.  My spouse loves cooking and is excited about the different types of food courses offered!  My daughters are interested in learning guitar and piano.  My sons may take karate or any number of age appropriate classes.  There is a limited day care that I haven't used yet, but am excited about the potential.  The gym is small but has what you need for a pretty good work out.  The indoor track is really nice, especially in the summer time.I just can't say enough good things about them!  I really am glad that it's here!

"This was actually the highlight of my last Vegas trip I know, not the gold, not the girls or the alcohol but the one day to really unwind here and get to use the facilities here. I loved the pool tables, basketball courts were amazing. it was cool on a 97 degree day. My friends and I loved it coming here.  I had not really been hitting the gym lately so I had the best time ever grabbing one handed rebounds with my old and new friends, showing them I still have some BASKETBALL game left. My jumpshot was still really nice.  I hit a lot of three pointers and my team won more than 80% of the games we played here.  It was really relaxing, I mean we could have been stuffing our face again in a buffet that day but this really worked.it is the best place to visit, leave the strip next time you are in Vegas and drive over here. I wish the exact same facility was in NY, I would go all the time.-Swimming pools here looked amazing, but didn't get to go.

"Huge place with a variety of activities to do!

There are many outdoor and indoor activities for all ages.  Definitely a must see for new residence and visitors.

"They have a fitness center, gymnasium, indoor track, wall climbing, dance classes, cooking classes an indoor, lapse and outdoor pool so make sure to bring your swim suit and gym clothes to enjoy all the fun!Check out their website for pricing and classes!

"I am amazed at the quality and luxury of this place. My 82 yr old mother moved in about 3 months ago and is the happiest I've seen her in years! Enjoying  the great living spaces, wonderful staff and fabulous food, she has made new friends and tells me about all the activities she is participating in.  I wish I were old enough to get a plac e here!!

"My Mother has lived at Westminster for over 5 years.  It has been the very best experience possible.  The staff have been tremendously helpful and caring.  When the time came to transition from independent to assisted living, they demonstratedgreat caring and patience in helping her through that lifestyle change.  Every department from Marketing, Home Health, Nursing, Housekeeping and more have continued to offer every assistance.  Our entire family would not hesitate to highly recommend this wonderful caring community.

"TLC Care Center gave me back my life ! I have been here over a year and plan on going home soon. I have received great care from my doctors, nurses, and the staff here. The physical therapy folks are the best ! God bless you and thanks TLC !!!

"My mother has been at four different rehab centers in Las Vegas over the past 1 12 years...and for the last several months, we have been at TLC. We could not be happier with the service, staff and environment. There is always a doctor on staff, which is very hard to find in a rehab...the nurses are very knowledgeable, courteous and attentive...and have been dedicated to giving my mother consistent attention. I would highly recommend this facility to anyone who deeply cares about where their loved one is placed. We can't be grateful and thankful enough.
",1
"I am a physical therapist and prior to my current position,  I used to work in home health. During my stint with home health, I had many patients at this facility. The facility is very clean and beautifully decorated with lots of open space. They have an extensive activity program and have nice exercise and game rooms. Even with all of this, the th that I was most impressed with was the care and professionalism of the staff. The staff here was truly caring and attentive. As a health care professional, I notice many things on facilities like this that others might miss, and I must say that Prestige is a fantastic place if you are considering assisted living for yourself or a family member.

"My 102 year old Mother in Law was here at Prestige for a couple of months and our experience was Excellent. Mostly because of the very compassionate, caring and understanding personal. They treated her and us wonderfully.

"Brighton Gardens of Scottsdale is a very well-kept place on the inside and on the outside. I included photos of the grounds near the northwest portion of the complex at 60Th ST and Thomas RD. As of today, the map shown at Yelp for Brighton Gardens is not accurately showing the location of 6001 E Thomas RD. The three staff members that I had contact with were very friendly and helpful. This Hospice of the Valley location is located on the Valley Metro (602-253-5000) bus line 29 (Thomas RD). There is a Fry's Food Store across the street on the north side of Thomas RD. The room I visited was very comfortable and clean.http:www.sunriseseniorliving.comcommunitiesbrighton-gardens-of-scottsdaleOverview.aspx

"Having to face the unfortunate fact that we may have to move our mother to a care facility I checked out Brighton Gardens on Thomas and 60th street.  I showed up a half hour prior to my planned meeting and was able to sit and observe the staff and what was going on.  Working in the medical field for over 25 years I know the signs to look for.  I was very pleased my the joy I saw on the employees faces.  I knew it was a happy place to be for everyone.  After meeting with Ginny the coordinator I felt really good.  I don't feel like it was a ""nursing home"".  The place was very nice.  I felt like I was in a hotel.  Having helped at a nursing home as a teenager I could never forget the smell of a nursing home. I can tell you this is not a nursing home.  It was wonderful, clean, active and happy.  I would recommend it for anyone looking for a great place for a loved one.

"My father died quite a few years ago, of ALS. It is a cruel, painful way to die. Fortunately, he spent his last few months getting hospice care, while living at Brighton Gardens. The staff there were unbelievably kind and thoughtful. I didn't realize this until much later, when I started looking for a place for my mother and realized how pitifully few places match this kind of quality. End-of-life is cruel, it can strip every last bit of dignity away from a person. But Brighton Gardens staff understood this and did everything they could to help him, and us. If we lived in Arizona now, I would definitely consider this place for my dear mom.

"After a lengthy stay in the ICU, my mom was brought here and spent three weeks.  We visited  a couple nursing homes but the one we selected couldn't take her.  She was brought here, but we were a little anxious after seeing it only had 2.5 stars.    This place far exceeded our expectations!  Its the only nursing home we went to that didn't smell like pee and poop.  The rooms are comparable to a nice hotel, VERY clean.  She enjoyed the food.  And most of the residents seemed to be in good spirits, which to us says a lot.  The nursing staff was fantastic.  She especially enjoyed her time with Ian, her speech therapist.  Physical therapy team did wonders.  She spent a month in the ICU, sedated for 2 weeks, on a feeding tube, and suffered ICU phycosis before she was brought to freedom plaza care center.  They had her up and walking and taking care of herself in a few short days.THANK YOU Freedom plaza care center staff, for giving us back our mom!

"If anyone is looking for a place for their parent or friend, you need go no further.  We were struggling with my father going through the stages of dementia, and general failings of age, medication, etc. and we were referred to this fabulous care home, Sunrise Home Facility, managed and owned by Lida Cubillos.  He is now there and doing so well, we are able to breathe a sigh of relief and all the anxiety about him is now gone for us.  Lida treats everyone like family, but with respect and privacy.  She makes it all clean and comfortable for the 10 residents she and her staff care for.  She was a registered nurse, and is a great patient advocate, she understands meds and the aging process -  coordinating well with doctors, while at the same time  also spending time with the residents herself, making them all feel special.  If you have any questions or want to hear more, please email me at lsscottmac.com, as I know how hard it is when trying to find good care.

"From the moment you meet Lida you know that your loved one will be taken care of. She's a dedicated and caring person who respects and understands people - and is involved with making sure operations work to her standards. Highly recommended.

"I am not a resident here...(still have a few years to go) but this place is awesome! I was lucky enough to visit and have lunch with some of the residents. The facility is absolutely beautiful and the staff are some of the friendliest people I have ever met. All of the residents I met told me how much they loved living there and everyone seemed so happy! They allow redident to have pets (under 30 lbs) wich I thought was really cool. They even have Happy Hour in the on-site bar!The food was great and the activities they offer residents are amazing. The day I was there they were setting up for Oktoberfest and beer tasting. Nice!If you have a loved one that needs a friendly, safe and fun place to live I would recommend you check this place out!

"My husband and I just returned from dinner at McDowell Village with my mother this evening, having had a lovely experience of good food, excellent service, and engaging residents who stopped by our table to say hello.  We've seen McDowell Village up close and personal for the last 8 months, attending special events and dropping in regularly.  My mother has enjoyed concerts, outings to restaurants that we would love to experience, fun card playing, participation in an art show, warm interaction with staff, new friends among residents, and a happy environment that feels like a mini-resort.  The staff has a great esprit de corps with fun, warm and caring attitudes; the residents have universally spoken about how happy they are there.  I would not hesitate to recommend McDowell Village.
",1
"I cannot say enough wonderful things about McDowell Village, including Debbie, Kristen, and Jay.  My parents, after searching the area for the right senior residence, decided on McDowell Village and they couldn't be happier.  There are activities all day long and special events for many of the holidays.  The restaurant's ambience is really nice and the food is delicious.  There are summer concerts, happy hour, outings, and shuttles to doctor appointments, local grocery stores, banks, etc. weekly.  The staff is outwardly caring and attentive to the resident's needs.  I live out-of-state and several months ago my mother had a health incident early one morning while I was talking with her on the phone.  I called McDowell Village immediately and they sent an ambulance AND a staff member went up to their apartment and stayed with them until help arrived. The staff's quick response time and ability to handle a potentially life-threatening situation allowed me time to get on a plane and get to my parents without nearly as much stress as I would have felt otherwise.  I could go on and on but suffice to say if you are looking for a senior residence, I highly recommend McDowell Village without hesitation.

"This is a great retirement community. I cannot review it much because I do not live here; however, My grandmother is very happy here and well taken care of.They have a daily list of events in which residents can partake in including things that are not on site. Meals each day as well differ and that gives residents chances to change things up. I've ate here several times and the food is very good especially with the plethora of different things cooked up on holidays.Residents are allowed small animals on premises as well which helps with companionship. There is a gym and activity center so that residents may also get exercise. Lastly, my grandmother's favorite----a beauty salon!

"I used All the Best Catering for a business luncheon and had a great experience!  Cheryl was very friendly and patient with my various questions and accomodated all of my requests.  I'm definitely bookmarking All the Best Catering for all my catering needs in Pittsburgh.
",1
"I was recently married at a venue that listed them as one of their four caterers to choose from. My partner and I did a tasting of their food, thinking we'd try to meet with at least two to three of the vendors, but after tasting the food (and getting zero response from the other caterer we'd outreached to) we decided to go with All the Best and we were both so glad we did. They were the most reasonably priced of all the listed caterers and I have to say,  going with All the Best, we really felt we got a lot of bang for our buck.The food was delicious and plentiful and the service was truly great - they thought of things my partner and I never would have. All of our guests raved about the food. Even though we got the stereotypical ""wedding food"" it was GOOD wedding food. I highly recommend them for catered events - plus, as a bonus, they own Pittsburgh BBQ company, so we were able to get mini pulled pork sliders as an appetizer, which everyone loved!
",1
"Great experience! We had a string quartet for our wedding (Steve Ehrlich strings) and they did a very nice job, were subtle but present and definitely knew what they were doing. Contact and communication before the wedding was very good too. Definitely recommended - and our guests really liked the live music!

"I hosted a bachelorette party for my sister at this location and overall everything was wonderful. There were a few customer service issues I had that I'd like to mention so that others are aware. 1- I booked the block of rooms 3 months in advance via the 1-800 number on the website. I have a military ID and requested the military discount. I was given the discounted rate for all 5 rooms and was told I only needed to present my ID upon arrival. Unfortunately, when I arrived the girl at the check-in counter told me that I could not have all 5 rooms at the discounted rate, that I could only have two of them. I pitched a royal fit and 40 minutes later they gave me all 5 rooms at the rate that I was quoted. Bad way to start a fun occasion.2- I emailed back and forth with Tracy Bernstein about specifics that I needed for this gathering I was hosting (iPod player, Microwave, Fridge, Early Check-in). I was told these things would be ready and they were not. We never got the iPod player, Microwave or Fridge. Bad customer service, Tracy.NOW, I'd like to tell you about the wonderful things at Holiday Inn City Center. 1- Very clean and modern. I loved the decor and it made great back drops for my photography.2- The rooms had adjoining doors which made it very easy for our guests to mingle.3- Jay Jay at the front desk was so friendly and helpful. He arranged a private limo service for us beautiful ladies for a great price. I've been told he has the ""hookup"" so make sure you get with him if you need anything special. 4- Adam is the food and beverage manager and he was so good to me. He offered to bring a 6 foot table in to our room with table cloths for FREE. Are you serious FREE He even came by the room to make sure we got all that I requested and warn us about the no noise policy starting at 11pm. We very happily toned it down by that point. The stay at the hotel was wonderful and the event was great. I really appreciate all that helped me at the hotel to make this event special!

"I stayed at this particular holiday inn last week  If you check my previous reviews I always stay in a holiday inn or candlewood when I travel (IHG brand).  While 9 out of 10 are good experiences this one takes the cake.  Based on yelp reviews we knew ahead of time about the parking fee (it is unavoidable in the center of the city)At least it is only a 1 time fee and they validate it for your stay.  After parking we go to hotel lobby to check in and were greeted by a very nice and helpful receptionist (I wish I remembered her name).  She told us that we had the best room in the entire hotel, and I truly believe it. Our room was 15th floor room 1534.  It was on the corner so we got 2 walls of windows, one side had a great view of uptown (not the arena which is behind the hotel), and the ceilings were over 12 feet high. Our king bed was comfy as always, and I always fall asleep quickly on them.The hotel itself is furnished in a contemporary style, and will appeal to 9 out of 10 people.  It is located one block from the Epicenter, and only a block or two from the lightrail system for easy commuting.    The one time we had to leave parking was to travel about 3.5 miles to go to an auditorium (we saw Wicked, and it was fantastic).  Other than that there was no reason to drive anywhere since you are close to everything in uptown.  In the beginning of my post I said that my boyfriend and myself always stay in a variety of the Holiday Inn brand hotels.  For anybody looking into hotels, I suggest you sign up for their rewards system, whether or be this one (priority club) or another chains version of it.  Hotels reward loyalty, and will do a lot to keep you loyal.  We did our research and liked the IHG brand (everything from Holiday inn express to Intercontinental)for a few reasons; they are literally everywhere so we knew that when we travel we can stay with them and continue earning points, and price-wise they stay competitive.  Our room preferences are already saved to our account (free to create).  So as a tip to everybody do a little research into hotels rewards programs, then stick to it.  If you stay with a hotel chain ten times a year, they will do a little more to keep you happy, and make up for any bad experiences you might have along the way. When I first started out with my Priority Club membership I highly doubt they would have upgraded me to the 15th floor with some of best views in the whole hotel, but because of my loyalty to them they rewarded me (at no additional cost).  The room was only $97, and that really can't be beat  for this location.

"My wife booked my son and I for a fatherSon weekend to the GiantsPanthers game. I had no idea a Holiday Inn could be so nice. It offered everything the top hotels had in my years of traveling. The decor, room, location were all 5 stars! The front desk and valet parking were top notch! I needed to charge my phone and iPad before the game and the valet brought my car down so we could sit and charge it. After we were done he parked it again with a smile.We will absolutely be back! Thank you for a wonderful stay!

"Perfect location with a warm friendly staff.  What more could you ask for  Everyone from the valets to front desk staff were wonderful.  Our room was clean and looked to have been remodeled in the last couple of years.  When we mentioned we were in Charlotte for a sick relative, kids in tow, and that it was our anniversary, they delivered chocolate covered fruit to our room.  If you book through their website, the prices are very reasonable.

"I had a birthday party here about 5 years ago and I brought about 9 of my closest friends and we dressed up in ballgowns with fancy jewelry and took pictures, then I got this super delicious vanilla cake with pink flowers on it. Of all of my birthday parties, this one wins hands-down. I know little about their food-but their cakes are pretty amazing! Adorable little place to have a party or sit down and drink some tea...kind of like a fairytale cafe...La-Tea-Da's is the coolest party place for girls in town.

"About me: female, New Yorker, foodie, design-loverLa-Tea-Da's did the reception catering for my wedding. Kelly Matthews was my catering lead and Jessica also helped on the day of the event.My expectations were dramatically exceeded. I would recommend them to anyone for these reasons:1. Flexibility - As an out-of-town bride, Kelly was quick in responses, edits to estimates and suggestions to queries via email since I couldn't attend in-person meetings too often.2. Professionalism - Team worked so I didn't have to think about anything on the day of the wedding. They even prepared plates and drinks for my husband and I so that we didn't wait in the buffet line and had a few minutes at our table to eat before crowds arrived. Jessica helped by directing us during the event as well and giving us heads up on timings. In addition to food, they helped set up decor - even lit lanterns and candles on tables!3. Fair Prices - I wanted interesting food combinations, which doesn't usually go hand-in-hand with reasonable pricing for a big event. However, Kelly was great in offering many choices and speaking to the chef several times to ensure we had great variety.4. Presentation - Food was displayed beautifully. Kelly gave helpful suggestions on how to set up the buffet for good crowd flow throughout the event. My favorite presentation was a small bamboo plate with a BBQ slider and homemade potato chips - delish!5. Quality - I received a lot of questions about who did my catering from friends who are also in the wedding planning mode. Guests loved the food and flavors were appealing to all.Again, can't recommend them enough - definitely add them to your list when interviewing caterers!
",1
"La Tea Da's catered both my rehearsal dinner and wedding this past April, and I don't even have words to express how amazing the whole experience was. Being a foodie and someone who works in the industry, I have pretty high standards. I certainly didn't make it easy on them! We brought La-Tea-Da's on as our caterer at the last minute. Seriously last minute - like a week before. Did I mention my wedding was multicultural and I wanted to include a good amount of Venezuelan and Spanish inspired dishes Janet met with me to discuss the menus only days before the wedding, and she put my mind at ease instantly. All of the challenges I thought would be insurmountable, namely my eclectic taste in food, only seemed to excite her more as she threw out creative solutions and suggestions with the enthusiasm of a kid in a candy store. In the end, I wound up with my dream menu. Incredible passed hors d'oeuvres, Paella, tapas, shrimp & grits, ceviche, gazpacho, tacos, sushi, a Venezuelan parilla station, late night philly cheese steak sliders, and more somehow all came together beautifully to create one of the best food experiences I've ever had. My guests consistently echo my sentiments as well. My only regret was not taking the time to eat even more (though it wasn't for lack of trying on the part of the staff! We arrived to the reception venue to a lovely candlelit sampling for two while the cocktail hour wrapped up and the amazing staff diligently kept our cups and plates full the whole night.) I could go on and on, but let's just say I'm anxiously awaiting a ten year vow renewal of some sort so I can call La-Tea-Da's up and do it all again.

"I will never be able to say enough about Elizabeth and the staff at La Tea Da's. They are beyond amazing! They catered our wedding reception and I have never heard so many compliments about food from guests at a wedding!! They also created a signature drink that was a huge hit and went above and beyond to make sure me, my husband, and our guests were enjoying ourselves. Elizabeth is a dream come true. She helped me from the initial stages of wedding planning and served as my day of coordinator. She is truly outstanding at her job!! We LOVE them and will be recommending them to all of our friends!!

"I've used Waiter's Choice for dozens of catering jobs. Mostly corporate lunches at work for 10 to 120 people. I have used their white tablecloth formal setup as well as their express style service. Most recently they catered breakfast  2 days last week and lunch 3 days last week each for 20 people. each delivery was perfectly on time, and exactly what I ordered. They are always professional and the food is great. in the last week alone, I have eaten their fried chicken, beef brisket, pulled pork, sausage, egg and cheese croissant sandwiches, cookies, brownies and a variety of sides. Keep up the good work, we need more place like Waiter's Choice that understand how to manage good food and fantastic customer service at reasonable prices.

"WC catered our Thanksgiving office party and did a nice ob. We ordered a traditional turkey and trimmings meal. Everything tasted delicious.

"Wendy C., how can you review a place that you've never been to I'm sure the Great Barrier Reef is worth a 5 star review, but I can't give it only 3 stars because its inconvenient (or any review for that matter). Anyway...saw Crandalls in Madison Magazine and the photos stood out to me. I didn't want to drive to the East Side for the Esquire Club. I was reluctant to try take out fish fry because I was worried about fried food getting soggy. I gave it a shot and I was impressed! First, the fish to beading ratio was really good. Big thick pieces of flaky fish with a dense, probably corn meal based, and crumb-style breaking (as opposed to the extra greasy tempura- style batter). It was nice and crunchy and the breading stayed that way on my 5-10 minute drive home. Tip: crack the styrofoam container to let the steam out for extra insurance against soggy fish. Served with a lemon. The fries were coated in something that made them extra crispy and they had a good seasoning. The slaw had good flavor but lots of dressing. Purists might say it was over dressed; others might say its just right. Tarter sauce was a little sweet and tangy, which was good contrast with the fish. The server gladly gave me extra. The bun was just as you would expect from a supper club, cheap, white, and doughy. Served with a butter chip. Everything was served together in a box; everything you need except several icy cold beers.The service was fine. The take out window was nice. It takes a few minutes for the order but I think they fry-to-order which is well worth it to me and a big plus. Any you cut it, it takes less time than waiting in line for dine in Friday Fish Fry.A little spendy for take out fish fry ringing up at over $25 for two dinners. That would be more than fair if I could park my fat ass there all night and eat all-you-can-eat. It's worth it though and I'll be back.

"The fish fry is awesome.  Loved it long time.  The red potatoes with cheese are delish.It's carry out but that is fine.Take it out, pop in a movie and have a brandy old fashion.The latinos working their are hot too.

"Crandalls has moved to state street, and is now serving authentic Peruvian food! We went there for dinner tonight, and it was fabulous. I highly recommend the cheese empanadas, solterito (fava bean and corn salad), and the chaufa de quinoa (like fried rice but with quinoa)! They make chicha morada, which is a drink made from purple corn, and is super refreshing.Crandalls is owned by a very sweet family from Peru, and I'm so happy to see that they are now showcasing their roots with their new restaurant!!They do still have their famous fish fry, and it looked like the lunch menu has cheese curds and sandwiches as well as ceviche.

"Had our wedding here and it was fantastic! Absolutely loved working with Stacey - she answered all our questions and got back to us in a timely manner. They were totally flexible and the serversbartenders were phenomenal! We have had nothing but compliments about our wedding, I would recommend Windsor in a heartbeat!Because we booked our wedding reception on Friday night we were told we would be receiving a ""complimentary"" champagne toast. After the wedding though we received a bill charging us for the service fee and gratuity for pouring the champagne. We paid it without any grievances, but it would have been nice if they would have informed us of this when we were going over the preliminary invoice. Other than this minor issue, Windsor was wonderful!

"I have no complaints.  My brother and I were throwing a 50th Anniversary party for our parents and I was looking for some decorations.  The woman who first helped me explained the pros and cons about paper vs. plastic plates.  Then another woman came to help and she said why don't I rent the plates  They are totally cheap and I got the white with gold rim china plates.  I picked them up the day before the event and they loaded them in my trunk.  When I dropped them off, they took them out too.  They come in a closed plastic banquet plate container and you don't have to wash them!!!  To me, I was being green as well as making it a very nice looking table.

Not to mention every kind of paper good you could ever imagine!  *Like the person below me i have driven by it for years, happy i finally went in! It was easy to load up and drop off, and the staff was very helpful. I will definitely go back in to use Party People again.

"This is a great place! I pop in here all the time. They always have what I need and the prices are usually lower than elsewhere.I rented tables, chairs, dishes, silverware, and goblets for my son's outside wedding. Everything looked wonderful! The lady who helped me gave some wonderful suggestions.  We had no problems with delivery and there was no problem with the order.I highly recommend using them for all your event needs!

"I live in California and was looking for a local florist in Phoenix to send a friend an arrangement, I looked on Yelp and found the Garden of England Flower shop and decided to give them a call. I want to thank all the people that recommended this florist! When I called the owner answered and was very friendly, she made some suggestions for the arrangement and scheduled the delivery for the same day. I didn't see the arrangement but I did get a call from my friend a few hours later thanking me for the ""gorgeous floral arrangement"". I will definitely use Garden of England again if I ever need so send flowers in the Phoenix area again and I highly recommend this florist.

"I've been to the Glass Center perhaps 5 or so times now. I've gone for a toursdemonstrations and two ""Make It Now"" classes. I have thoroughly enjoyed going each and every time. Some of the art they have on display is fantastic. It was interesting the last time I went because local artists were there to sell glass work they made.The Make It Now classes are well worth $25. You get to be somewhat involved in creating the object (You get to pick the color, blow the glass, and do a couple of other things. You never get too hot to the ovens or do anything dangerous at all. If you want to be more involved, there are other more advanced classes that you can take), plus you have a wonderful piece of art to take home! I've made an ornament and pumpkin so far and will be making a flower soon. The instructors have all been very nice and helpful as well, making the experience even better.I can't wait to go back!
",1
"I LOVE the glass center. I've been lucky enough to attend quite a few events here, and also do a small class where I was able to make an ornament. The staff is always friendly and fun, and I always leave feeling grateful that we have such a unique place here in Pittsburgh!

"The Glass Center is a marvelous addition the Pittsburgh cultural scene.  They are a gallery, a place to take classes, a center for glass artists in residence, and much more.  Whether you are taking a tour, a class, or visiting the gift shop or gallery, there's a lot to see and learn here.  I've taken tours several times with different groups, but I always learn something new and I am always impressed by the great work takes place at the Center.They will take students at every level.  Their facility is well run and professionally staffed.  I was delighted to meet their enthusiastic staff.There's a hot shop, a cold shop, a flame shop, and a gallery, so there's lots to see and learn.

"I went to a yelp event here, where we were able to make a fused glass piece and also watch some demonstrations and go to the gallery. Everything in the gallery was amazing. The demonstrations were neat, and the fused glass was something I would go back to do again.I really didn't know that the glass center was open most of the time, and if you go there on any random day, you can watch whatever is going on. I think that is pretty cool! They also have classes where you can blow glass or make beads or whatever you want... I can't wait to pick up my piece and come back for another class!

"Went here with my girlfriends last Saturday.  They were having a girls night event.  A small bar & desserts were included in the price.  It was $40 per person. We loved it!  We worked closely with a glass artist.  We didn't just watch, we were acutally doing it!  We made glass flowers, I can't wait to pick mine up!  (It takes a few days.)  I definitely recommend this as something different to do with friends or on a date! My one friend did a glass blowing event there & said that this was much more HANDS ON than the glass blowing was.

"This isn't  a review of the museum itself, but of the special exhibit they were hosting - Jim Henson's Fantastic World.  I couldn't find somewhere to post a review of jus the exhibit.The exhibit is traveling around the country for the next few years - and if you are a Henson Fan you should definitely try to see it.  Here is a list of where it will be http:www.sites.si.eduexhibitionsexhibitshensonmain.htmThe exhibit includes original posters, drawings and notebooks, video clips, as well as Muppets.  Kids will enjoy seeing the Muppets, adults will enjoy the whole exhibit.  At the end was a place for kids to put on a puppet show, make a storyboard and make a face for a Muppet.It was very interesting to get an insight into the genius Henson was, and how if he didn't use an idea in one place, he would try to get it incorporated into something else.Its at this museum until March 9th.

"This museum is fantastic. We recently visited it on vacation. I have a 8 year old and an almost 5-year old. They have a pretend area for younger kids.  It is a bit young for my kids, but of course they still loved it. The exhibits in the museum were well thought out with opportunities for children to experiment in all different mediums. For example, one of the two exhibits was called Table Manners. We could read books about table manners, experiment with chopsticks and play food, make table scapes and then draw them, and much more. And then of course, there was the art. They had a nice selection, again in different mediums. Museum was clean, staff was friendly and overall, we will visit again if in town.

"I was told about this place a long time ago and finally went with my son this week.  It was awesome!  We spent our time in Artville where it's totally kidproof and touchable.  It costs an admission fee for kids over 1 so it made sense for us to buy a membership if we planned on coming a few more times.  We'll definitely go back!Update 2011:We still have a membership here, it's not too busy on the weekdays, which I have off in the summertime.  On saturdays it can get kinda crazy - go early if you can.  Bring a sweater if you tend to get cold because the AC is CRANKED.  Watch out for the people who don't pay attention and let their kids go bonkers in Artville.  That area is meant for ages 0-4 and occasionally you'll get some bigger kids in there andor one of those jerkface kids that is a little brat while their parent is in a corner, texting obliviously.  you know what i'm talkin' about.  If you're a member, they have early admission days, usually on a thursday...which would be nice if i wasn't working :(.  I wish they would do that on a saturday.

"This place was fantastic.  He held our organization's Holiday Party and Silent Auction here.  What a great place for kids.  My twins had a blast and the space lend itself so perfectly for our party.  The staff was very helpful and accommodating.  We moved furniture around since we had to use several tables from other rooms for our Silent Auction items.  The event was fantastic, unfortunately, I was so busy running around making sure everything went well with the silent auction that I didn't get to enjoy the space with my twins.  Good thing I had a sitter help my hubby.  I guess I'll have to come back soon.

"My son absolutely ADORES this place! There is plenty to do, they have made some good changes to their layout and also their exhibits and play areas if you haven't been here in a while. A lot of hands on activities for the children, and the adults can participate too. Definitely a nice place to let your children explore their creative side in the East Valley.

"I came here for a birthday party.  It was so much fun.  We were greeted by the front desk.  They informed us that our host were not there yet, but we were welcome to roam around the place.  They had arts and crafts everywhere.  Interesting facts and information on the walls.  When our host arrived we follow our guide to a back area (filled with trees and tableschairs for outdoor activities) and then to a building in the back for our party.  We had the whole back building to ourselves.  It was nice!  Tables, chairs, and art canvasesart supplies all set up.  Signs wishing our birthday girl (with her name on it).  The room has it's own bathrooms so you do not need to run back to the main building.  We had 1-12 hours in the back room.  Then we were free to enjoy the museum.  There are two separate areas artscraft & playlearn room.  I had fun along with the kids.

"This music store should be THE example for all music stores. The staff are knowledgable, friendly and professional. I've had a few guitars set up to perfection that were supposedly set up previously. HIGHLY recommend.

"This quaint little music shop is a secret find of mine.  Great prices, fantastic staff, and knowledgeable staff (important in this business).  I love coming to this music store because they always seem to have what is needed, and having three musicians in our house, that is important.  We recently took an instrument to be looked at for repair and the guy fixed it on the spot, no charge. Of course, we ended up spending money in the store anyways, so it was a win-win for Buchanan Music and myself.  I've me the owner a few times and he's always willing to work with me on prices and helped order me a personalized product once. Highly recommended.
",1
"Buchanan Music is an authorized Takamine dealer and Russ is the guy that we've dealt with in the past year.  He is completely awesome.Sometimes calling, whomever picks up the phone, if it's a woman, it's a bit hard to understand her, but as long as we get Russ there's no issues.  He was our go to when we needed to get our Takamine replaced, Russ helped us so much in sending our guitar to KMC Music, but also receiving it, which is another story in itself.  He made sure we got a good guitar this time.  And about 6 months later, the guitar needed some adjustments and Russ did it.  The guitar plays beautifully and we appreciate Russ' talent in working on guitars.  You can tell he loves the instrument and is a master craftsman.We appreciate your work, Russ.  Thank you for helping my husband develop his passion and love for the guitar.

"I attended a class at Scottsdale Art School and was fabulously happy with not only the class but the staff as well. The school has a warm friendly atmosphere that makes you want to come back.  It was a great experience and I absolutely would like to return for more classes.
",1
"Scottsdale Artist's School is a great place for a workshop. It was an elementary school at one time and still has an interesting traditional quality with beautiful tile floors, generously sized classrooms, a lovely patio, and a professional staff.The school brings notable artists from all over and students also come from everywhere.The Friends of the School organization gave a reception on Thursday with bountiful food & wine. That night there was a gallery walk in Old Town.I enjoyed my week there. Scottsdale itself doesn't have great appeal though there wasn't time to explore much and that is just as well.

"Love this internationally known art school.  Whether you are a art workshop junkie or enjoy the open studios, this is an amazing place to learn or improve your skill.  The staff is super helpful.  Due to my work schedule, I have only taken one workshop from one of the famous instructors (although I regularly droll through the online offerings) but drive down to Scottsdale for the evening or Saturday open studios.  Pay $10 for hours of a variety of models in short & long poses.  The school has decades of great reputation for a reason.

"The Tempe Center for the Arts  700 W Rio Salado Parkway is where I went to see Childsplay last weekend. What a beautiful venue!Ferdinand the Bull was showing & it was fabulous! Kudos to the entire cast! Folks, this place is really a treasure. I know you've heard people say that nonchalantly about stupid stuff but this is for real!Like all of our other theatres in town, this place deserves our patronage and support. If you don't have kids, go alone or take your niece or nephew! You won't be disappointed.
",1
"There's no business like show business. As any of my friends will tell you I am a theater junkie. I could sit in a theater all day, all week, all year long and do nothing but gaze at live performances of theatrical talent. lol! Well in actuality, hmmmmmmm I really could. I am not even joking on that. I probably would if someone brought me water every now and again. LOL!  Ok, seriously now, Childsplay is my favorite organization in Az for a host of reasons.    My dear friends of Childsplay know who they are. This is children's theater at it's best! The Q and A sessions after each show is a plus. The kids love it. I have to admit I do too since I get to go say hi to my friends after each stage-show. I also learn more techniques that I can steal when I teach drama to my inner city students. Teehee!  ( Yes I am a teacher and yes I would die to have some of their costumes and sets)    I have seen so many wonderful plays, literature remakes, and original scripts performed At TCPA and by Childsplay. Fernidad, BFG and New Kid were only some of the most amazing masterpieces I have had the distinct pleasure of viewing from these talented actors. Debbie, Scott, Katie, Jodi; well all of them! LOVE YOU!   Childsplay also has an artist in Residence program for schools. We have had an artist at our school for several years. It is wonderful to note that the teaching techniques classroom teachers are learning are helping tomorrows future. Time after time I have seen struggling kids blossom under their tutelage.     Of importance to note, TCPA is a beautiful facility. You can enjoy a nice venue along with the superstar talent. What more can you ask for     The only negative I can possibly imagine is that in today's hard times the cost may be inhibiting to some families. But if you like them on Facebook they sometimes have discounted tickets and contests to win free tickets. A great way to start viewing them and get involved.    I do hope everyone continues to support the arts here in Az. As I have stated in my other ""ARTS"" reviews, I do worry about cultural program survival in Az with recent state budget cuts. Soooooooo, as a famous circusrodeo person once said, ""Go, On With The Show"".

"I went to see a show at The Tempe Center for the Arts with my son few weeks ago. Rock the Presidents was showing and it was highly entertaining! The venue was incredibly beautiful. The music was fantastic, the cast was incredible, and the presentation was just phenomenal. We loved it! My son learned so much about the leaders of our country in a 70 minute show. There were students screaming and dancing, fist-pumping, having a blast rocking with the presidents. Thank you for providing such great entertainment! Deserves 5 stars!!
",1
"I have never been to a show I didn't like!  Childsplay is the creme de la creme of children's theatre.  The actors are phenomenal and the bees knees at their craft.  Their costumes and sets hypnotize me and reel me in from the get go.  I love their Q&A sessions at the end of each play and the fact that they have a set of questions you can take home with you for the car ride back.  They use literature for the majority of their plays and have new shows every single year.  But what is even better is their traveling shows they send to schools around the valley and country.  If you are lucky enough to get a grant for them to come, you get shows that are just as good as those in the Tempe Performing Arts Center.  Their sets are smaller, but they have their amazing costumes, props, and music along with them.  They still do Q&A sessions after these traveling shows and give us teachers those same questions that they do at the TPAC shows.  It doesn't matter if you are an adult without kids...everyone should attend at least one Childsplay show in their lifetime.  You are missing out if you don't!

"Awesome programming for children's theater! They also run acting classes for children on weekends and during summer camps. My child has participated numerous times and we've seen incredible progress in his talent and skills.

"I really cannot write enough good things about this studio and its teachers. My son has been playing violin since he was 3, he is now 8 and starting his second year with the las vegas youth orchestra. He has learned an extraordinary amount from Ms. Berns and other teachers there who have really guided his ability. He has fun and really loves to read and play and compose music. My daughter has been  taking piano lesson for a year now and I appreciate the humor and patience of her teacher. He has gone the extra mile to find material to really teach her all about piano.

"Grew up near here. the family would always go once a month. Haven't stopped in for a few years until last Friday with a few friends to grab a drink. The sandwiches are always amazing just as I remember. The staff is amazing and friendly. Great place for lunch as well.

"Let there be no question: Alexions owns the best cheeseburger in the region and they have now for decades. Try a burger on Italian bread. The service is flawlessly friendly, the food is amazing, and the wings Oh the wings... but it's still about the cheeseburger. The atmosphere is inviting, but you can't eat atmosphere... so go right now. Grab the car keys... you know you're hungry for an amazing cheeseburger, maybe some wings, and a cold beer! Easily, hands down, the best bar and grill in Pittsburgh.
",1
"The sandwiches, the wings, enough said. Alexions can best be described as a home-style Primantis before they went mega commercial. You really can't go wrong, but for my money, I would put Alexions fish sandwich up with the best I've had. That's not to take away from other selections, but if you come here I recommend not leaving until you've had either the fish sandwich, Reuben, or wings. You'll know you're in a Pittsburgh bar when you walk in. For someone who lives in Atlanta now and only makes it to Pittsburgh a few times a year, I have to say it is refreshing. Feels like home. I haven't had a trip back without making it out to Alexions at least once.

"GREAT PLACE FOR A BIRTHDAY PARTY!  A FAMILY GATHERING!  A WORK RETIREMENT PARTY!  OR EVEN A DOUBLE-DATE!A combination watering hole, great place to eat and great entertainment for adults! Adult games!The Homestead (Pittsburgh) location of Dave & Busters is just one of the almost 50 locations across the country - from New York to Florida to California - - from Canada to Mexico.  The Dave & Busters idea was conceived in Little Rock, Arkansas back in the 1970s. Two different businesses (one a popular watering hole & one a game & entertainment business) were right next door to each other. The two young owners were friends and quickly realized that combining their businesses made perfect sense. So they opened the first combined D & B in  . . . . no, not Little Rock, but Dallas! To this day there are no D & B's in Little Rock. Not sure what is up with that! But lots of other cities have been the beneficiaries of these two friends combining their businesses.The one in Pittsburgh is the only one I have ever been to.  When I lived there, a group of friends and co-workers (and me, of course!)used to go there for Happy Hour & Power Hour . . . . at least once a week. We had a blast!  A great place to kick-back and let the worries of the work day melt away.Wonder if they'll ever open one in Marin County, CA Shucks!  Probably not. Not a Marin County scene, for sure. WHAT A BLAST IT WAS THOUGH! I miss going to D & B. They have all the classics, like billiards & shuffleboard, plus over 200 interactive & video games. A rechargable Power Card provides an easy way to access all the games.  POWER HOUR is game HAPPY HOUR - - an entire hour of classic and video games for just  ten bucks.  A GREAT BAR, WONDERFUL FOOD AND SERVICE! A RELAXING AND FUN WAY to spend a Friday or Saturday evening. You'll never want to leave. Meet your friends here, grab a beer and a burger or steak and hit the games. Time will just evaporate . . . . while you laugh and drink with your favorite girl, your best friend or even your boss!  DAVE & BUSTERS! LOTS OF PARKING! LOTS OF FUN!FUN! FUN! FUN! FUN! FUN! FUN! . . . . BRING ON THE BEER!
",1
"Dave and busters is the best place to eat and play games. There is many fun games and prizes to win. I highly suggest if you want to plays games, go Wednesday when all the games are half off. Food is pretty good and a nice bar. The downside is that the booze is pretty pricey.
",1
"I love it!  Love it!
",1
"Dave & Busters is a great experience  if you set your expectations realistically and carefully choose when you attend.The main squeeze and I always 1) use a survey receipt for buy $10 get $10 in free gameplay or 2) Attend on a Wednesday during the day (flexible work schedules). We'd never dream of eating there because we like healthy yuppie food. And we only drink cheap drafts OR drink cocktails during happy hour.Your visit is largely determined by time of day, expectations and whether or not you eat their food. If you come on a Friday night, the lines will be long. You'll pay $150 for the two of you to eat, drink and play for 3 hours and you'll be left with a very sour taste in your mouth.The staff is really excellent; any issue with a game not paying out tickets results in immediate help and extra tickets or a swipe for a different game from an employee. Note the ""drinks are weak"" reviews. Also notice it was people buying shots and ordering multiple drinks per person. That's typical white trash behavior. Bartenders here are savvy; they mirror the behavior of the guests. All of our drinks have been consistently strong and well put together because we're courteous and tip well. I have witnessed bartenders bypass tattooed, loud guests and address me and take my order first. This is rational, logical behavior. Also note the ""prize center games suck"" comments. You're supposed to stack tickets over multiple visits and use them on a big prize. Like life, delaying gratification nets you bigger returns. Every other visit I've seen someone walk out with a video game system (Wii, Xbox360 and even a few Xbox One's). The thing about Dave & Busters is the crowd changes depending on day of week and time of day. Sunday afternoon it's all families and Friday and Saturday night it's all drunk 20 somethings. The atmosphere changes and that's why the reviews are all over the place.This review is based on 8ish months of 1-3monthly visits. Most visits are 5 stars, some are 4 stars.Using survey receipts for Buy Ten Get Ten, avoiding Wednesday, Friday or Saturday evenings (and Sunday afternoon, families) and avoiding the food entirely and drinking cheaply, you'll have a great experience for $25-40person.I really enjoy the staff too, they split the difference between fun and professional. Special shout out to Riley, gave us info on possibly hosting a party there.

"After having a few 'less than memorable' trips to D&B in years past, my wife and I  decided to go back for a Pittsburgh Happy Hour Anniversary party this past Thursday.  Pgh Happy Hour is a facebook group of friends that like to check out new 'watering holes' every thursday and it's run by a guy that seems to party 247 while still holding down a very lucrative full time job.  Anyway- Pgh HH was celebrating an anniversary and chose D&B for the location.  The D&B staff set up the back 'pool room' with complimentary,  enormous spread of appetizers with dips and kept refilling them when they got low.  Our server, Carla, was very attentive and friendly- making sure we were aware of the specials and checking back often when our glasses got to the half way point.  The other server back there was working equally as hard but I never got the chance to get her name.  I had been here one other time for an organized happy hour for a past employer and remember very similar service but I never got the chance to give them any credit.  I think D&B is an awesome place when you need some space for your next event.

"First off, let me say that I find the people who usually work at Dave and busters usually don't care or seem to be angry and hate their job. A friend and I went here and found that a couple of the machines ran out tickets and someone was always there and happy to help. The staff went out of their way to make sure we had a good time. The manager Tony was very sweet and made sure everything was ok. Every staff member we talked to was extremely nice. This is by far the best Dave and busters I've had been to!

"I am a big fan of Rock Bottom.There are several dishes that are MONEY.Appetizer:  Seared Ahi, Spinach Artichoke DipEntree :      Fire Steak, Pub Tips or Chicken Fried Chicken.Desert :      Carrot Cake (to die for)Bar food:     Pizza or ball park pretzels.  Both of which are sprayed with brown ale.  Half the menu is really good, the other half is great.  The beer is good.  Ask for the sampler!  They usually have a velvet and something on cask.  Ask for one of those if you are looking for something different.  They will also have a scotch ale, an IPA, whiskey stout or other specialty depending on the mood of the brewer (which, if its still Matt, the mood is GRUMPY).   If Andy is still working there, he is sure to please and Molly is great in the cocktail area.Head over to Sing Sing after dinner and its a wrap.I used to work there several years ago and I make it a point to hit every RB I possibly can.Don't go to the one in Charlotte though, its not really a Rock Bottom.

"I would have to say I'm pretty partial to Rock Bottom, I have been going almost every Thursday for the past 3 years because of the fantastic ""Team Trivia"". My friends and I love the atmosphere, the DJ (Todd), and the service that we get at Rock Bottom. Every week when we go a menu is never needed because we pretty much know everything we want on it, except for when the change the menu from time to time and we get to have a special treat with something new! As an avid Rock Bottomer, hands down I have never in my life had a better spicy spinach cheese dip than I have had here at Rock Bottom. Whether I have eaten dinner or not before I come down to the restaurant, my favorite and my food of choice is the ENORMOUS Ball park pretzels with the cheese dip. It is a meal itself! The mixture of onions, cheese, spinach and tomatoes is perfection! Another favorite of mine is the Barbecue Chicken Pizza, it has a great kick to it and it's big enough for two people. The service has always been super great and now since we go often we have developed a great relationship with some of the wait staff. A truly great place to have fun with friends and meet new people! Come to Team Trivia every Thursday at 8pm!

"While visiting relatives in Somerset we decided to go shopping in the nearby town of Homestead.  My aunt insisted that we have lunch at Uno's Pizzeria & Grill as the food was delicious.  When we arrived I had to admit that I was impressed with the decor and atmosphere of the place.  It was fairly crowded for a weekday but we were seated in less than ten minutes.  The waitress was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu answering all our questions with ease.  I settled on a Turkey, Bacon and Avocado sandwich and old fashioned tomato soup after looking over the menu several times.  They have a variety of dishes guaranteed to please all ages.  The food arrived in no time and was DELICIOUS!  The portions were just right for lunch, I was definitely ready for an afternoon of shopping.  The four of us had items off the Two for U lunch menu, our bill was less than $30 which meant that I might could afford the shoes I wanted to buy!  My aunt was right, you cannot visit Homestead without stopping to eat at Uno Pizzeria & Grill, it is FANTASTIC!!

"It gets 5 stars cause it jogs up a memory. Back before Pizza Hut turned into a fast food restaurant, the Pizza Hut my grandfather used to take me to was a really nice restaurant. And this location has the same look and feel as the old pizza hut before it went take out. So this is the old style pizza hut. Very family orientated dining style. You can sit here for hours. And so we did. We had a heap of use in a long table.I ordered one of the small pizzas which were buy 1 get one free. Disappointed in the selection of that. Seeing other choices... I regretted going on the cheap. Prices are moderate. 12 for a little pizza... but with all the dough, you get full. Can't say I walked away hungary. Nor did I finish my second mini pizza. I want to come back and get that spanich fetta looking pizza!

"My wife, my daughter and I went here for breakfast. I got the breakfast special: $5 for French toast and eggs. Clean, great service, delicious food. You can't beat it for breakfast.

"Place has amazing omelettes that are almost as big as the size of the plate. You get a really big side of home fries too. This is probably my favorite place for breakfast in Pittsburgh. I generally go in and get a seat right away without waiting. Service is usually fast and friendly. Two downsides to the place. 1) they are cash only which can be an inconvenience. I never remember to have cash until I get my bill so I have to run to the ATM. 2) the seating is limited and the tables are very close to each other so people there can most likely hear your conversations. Place overall is excellent and is worth a try at least for breakfast. The lunches and dinner selections aren't bad either!!

"After being disappointed with a karate school on the far North side, I began looking for another place to train, I happened across Arizona Family Karate Academy, and I must say... the instructors there are top notch! They take the time to work with you, to educate you, and to make you feel special. I can make up classes whenever needed, and  in the three months I've been going there, I haven't yet found them to be closed due to some family emergency or out of school function. Both Ms. Pam and Ms. Angelica are dedicated to ensure that you get the most benefit in your class. They work with you, one on one, and make sure you are comfortable during class. They genuinely care about you! I've also seen what they do with children of all ages, and I am very impressed. The school also has great specials (a ""try before  you buy""), and participate in most local community activities (and NEVER need to close the school to do so!). I'm impressed and proud to be a member of this ""family"", and feel that I have made good friends with both the instructors and fellow students!

"I like the fact that the karate classes are structured so that they cater to beginners as well as to kids with advanced belts. Some of the belt requirements are even posted on the group's website! I also am impressed with YCOA's emphasis on self-defense in case kids get approached by strangers who wish to do them harm.

"I love the programs offered at Yong Champions of America! They keep the programs affordable while still giving great attention to each member of the class. The coaches seem knowledgeable on the arts, and I trust their abilities to teach. The classes are affordable, but we all know life happens sometimes, and the scholarship opportunity has been a huge help! I am so thankful that the focus of the program is on each student's opportunity to perform and improve, not on creating competition and tension. With karate, cheerleading, soccer, and dance, I know there are plenty of opportunities for trying new things!
",1
"The programs offered at Young Champions of America are incredible for so many reasons.  They are very affordable and the instructors pay great attention to each student.  It gives each student a great amount of confidence and there are so many different activities to try.  There is so much room for personal growth and development for all students.  Boredom is not ever a possibility for anyone here!
",1
"I was beyond impressed with the level of dedication these coaches have!  The programs are top notch and the kids actually learn to develop inner strength along with their physical strength.  SO much better than babysitting them with video games!The fees are so reasonable, I really am amazed at the quality of what these kids are learning.  I LOVE that this is available in times like these, and especially in this kind of weather!
",1
"The techniques that my nieces and nephews learned were amazing! They were a little apprehensive at first, but the staff was very professional and made them feel like they were getting better. The work ethic that they instill in these kids is simply incredible. They are patient, kind, and most of all, affordable. I was not sure how long they would be apart of the program, but they and the teachers both surprised me! I've always believed that knowing how to defend yourself is something everyone should know, and this is place to start for younger kids.

"I'm writing this review as a alternate perspective of MMAC, because one star, in my opinion, is grossly underrating the value of the dojo. Sensei Rick is dedicated to the art of martial arts, as well as the sport. He focuses on the basics, knowing that a strong foundation in karate is what leads to strong fighting. In this dojo, there are many philosophies, but the essential one is to always ""Kick. Punch. Sweat."" The dojo is made up of hardworking individuals, and the path to a blackbelt is not for everyone.If you were to talk to Sensei, you would see he is dedicated to the community; each year the dojo participates in toy drives and hosts a Karate Kamp; which is an opportunity for kids to participate in karate during the summer.I believe the best way to get a sense of the dojo is to visit it yourself; it is kept neat and clean, and even features a study center so that students can also focus on their academics between training. I highly recommend Mountainside Martial Arts

"My son has been in attendance at MMAC for more than 5 years now, and changes have certainly taken place within the organization.  This dojo is deliberate in creating a balance between kata, kumite (sparring), and basics.  It is also set as a traditional Japanese dojo teaching Wado Ryu Karate.  This is not a cut-throat plaza mall dojo, like the Cobra Kai in ""Karate Kid"", that teaches students to harm each other and fight as a primary resource to resolving a physical confrontation.  If you are looking for a fight club, look elsewhere.That being said, my son specializes in fighting here and does very well.  He has participated in over 30 tournaments in AZ, CA, UT, CO, and NV.  He has won several of these, and usually medals at every event. He is part of a competition team that takes extra time to train in fighting and competing.  I am confident in his abilities.The dojo is restructuring, and growing, and all for the better.  It has the best workshops, training clinics, guest speakers, and REAL tournament training by far.  I couldn't be more proud to recommend it to anyone looking for polished and professional, traditional Japanese technique and practical self-defense instruction.

"MMAC is an asset to the Ahwatukee community, providing traditional martial arts training where discipline is learned and advancement is earned. This is a traditional Japanese dojo, where everyone doesn't get a medal and you don't buy your child's blackbelt in 2 years; enablement, entitlement, and excuses are not tolerated. My son has been training with the Sensei's of MMAC since 2006, starting in their program held at the Ahwatukee YMCA at the age of 7. Anyone who has met my son will attest to his maturity, balance, and discipline, and I attribute much of that learned behavior to his dedicated training at MMAC.

"Outstanding Dojo with patient sensai. My son's have been going here for three months now and love it. They are an easy business to work with and are great with kids. Highly recommended

"Can't say enough great things about this place. My 14 year old son has taken jujitsu here for the last 2 years.  The instructors are amazing and the staff is very professional.

"I used to train in this dojo as a teenager a couple of years ago. Ray Hughes Sensei has got to be one of the best role models in the Martial Arts community. Both Hughes Sensei and Tyler Sensei are incredible with kids, they keep their attention, make the classes fun, but most importantly they properly teach their students how and when to defend themselves. The programs are not only for children, but for all ages, including adults. In fact there are several intense seminars dedicated to adult training, focusing on developing both the mind and body to properly defend itself. Basic class setup: Starts of with stretching, cardio, basically a quick warmup. Next a quick meditation (the dojo is a stress free environment, meditation is to help calm your mind). Then you go through basic form drills (to ensure you have correct footing, hand placement, and momentum). Towards the end, there might be sparing drills (safety first, all students are required to wear padding for arms, legs, and a mouth guard). Class is finished off with another meditation to unwind the body. The main focus of the dojo is teaching Wado, but there are other floors dedicated for Jujitsu and other Martial Arts Programs. Great, clean facility. Near the Ice Den, so plenty of parking. Located in a safe area. Quality wooden floors in the smaller rooms, and padding on the main floor to ensure maximum safety. Clean, cold water fountain. Air conditioned, fans to circulate air. Well lit. Spacious locker rooms, clean bathrooms. Well stocked inventory with padding and gis (uniforms) for all sizes. No contracts, just a monthly payment, if you dedicate yourself to the classes and really want to learn, then it is well worth the money!

"SMAC was a wonderful dojo for our family. My son was there through his purple belt, my daughter through blue. We spent many, many hours there and I cannot sing their praises enough. I appreciate all of the teachers especially Sensei Tyler and Sensei Ray. They are patient yet firm. Their traditional dojo is the real deal.After years of practicing there, when my son decided to leave the dojo to try something else he went to Sensei Ray to talk to him about it, Ray was gracious and encouraging to my 10 year old son. It made all the difference in the world. That is the type of outstanding character Sensei Ray has. My son still remembers what they talked about and knows the door is open for him to come back anytime.

"I love love love this place and I'm grateful to Yelp reviews for sending me in their direction. It's only fitting that I add to the reviews. My 4 year old daughter attends the Pee Wee Karate two days a week and she loves it. The two teachers, Ray and Tyler are incredibly funny, entertaining, and know how to relate to kids phenomenally. Truly, I enjoy watching the entire class just to see the teachings and interactions between the sensei and students. The price is reasonable for classes, especially if you partake in the twice weekly option. They're flexible about makeups, too.My daughter is learning karate but also gaining confidence in a beautiful way. It's hard to describe but her experience is so much more than just karate. She's learning to speak in front of a group, getting exercise, having manners instilled more, and having fun at the same time. From what I gather talking with other parents, there are a lot of satisfied families who have been customers for many many years. I look forward to doing the same. Oh... and they had a Halloween party (2014) and I was blown away at the event they put on. It just goes to show how much they truly love these kids. It had so much (tons of food, light show, music, contests, awesome prizes, laser tag in the parking lot, and more).

"Mr. Young and his Black Belts continue the Professional Karate Center tradition in Henderson.  His abilities as a leader and a teacher are second to none.  I have known and trained with C-D Young for 18 years and he is one of the very best and brightest Martial Arts instructors around.You and your family will receive the very best in Self-Discipline, Self-Defense and character building.  You'll also have a great time as part of the Professional Karate Center Family!

"I am a 53 year old woman. I began taking Karate classes at C-D Young's Professional Karate Center in September of 2012. I started as a white belt, as everyone does. In the beginning I resoned that Karate would be a good physical outlet for my well being. Before long I recognized so many more benefits. I began to notice a growth in my self confidence, along with a sense of accomplishment which sparked a feeling of pride in my acheivements. I began to have higher expectations for myself. I started to push myself towards goals and on Feb. 2, 2013 I earned my yellow belt. That is when I realized that Karate is much more than a physical work out. It is a joy to witness the level of respect between the instructors and the students. At any age, young or old, I am a firm believer that Karate teaches focus. It helps with self confidence and self-esteem and it pushes you to set and reach your goals through perserverance, and it all happens in a fun atmosphere with instructors that are dedicated to show you how to achieve such self growth.

"I LOVE this place! Mr. and Mrs. Young are phenomenal!!! Unfortunately we were only able to stay a month due to unforeseen circumstances but my son improved so much in that month. I was hesitant on group classes but each student gets the perfect amount of time spent with them. My son truly developed in one month. I will also say the atmosphere here is just as wonderful as the owners. This is definitely the place to go for karate in Henderson.  You will not be disappointed!

"We started at Go For It USA because of Coach Ed. He was my then 4 year old's coach at a community center class and when classes stopped for the summer my son wanted to keep going so we went to the gym and signed up for Ed's class. My son loves Coach Ed and the gym! He always enjoys his classes and is growing stronger every day. I only intended to keep him at the gym through the summer months but then my 8 year old saw the boys team practicing and decided he wanted to do join too! So here we are a year later and my boys really love the gym! We live in south Las Vegas but I drive there because that's where they want to be! Compared to other gyms with the same programs, their cost and class selection can't be beat! Tammy at the front desk is really friendly and always helpful as is the whole staff! They really care about the kids and it shows in everything they do and in all the programs they offer. This summer (2013) we've had the opportunity and need to use the drop in day-camp and my kids really had a great time and look forward to every chance they get to attend the camp and really any other activities they offer. We also did a birthday party there for my youngest when he turned 5-he chose the gym- and all the families that attended had a great time and couldn't believe how much fun it was to have a party at a gym and what's more, the older kids (12-13 years old) in attendance had a blast too. My now 9 year old started with Coach Ed too, it was his choice and he really enjoyed Ed as his teacher. He's now on boys team and likes his new coaches Dave, Nalani and Kyle who always encourage and challenge him.  If you're looking for a gym for your child, Go For It USA is the best place for the perfect balance of fun and structured learning. They have so much more to offer than just gymnastics!

"I have two children who have attended classes here with the Matthews and all I can say is they are part of our family now and forever. My children respect,admire and truly love this family. They have given so much to us and really have helped raise our children to be dynamic indiviuals with morals and respect. I recommend them every chance I get.

"They accepted my tiny tiger at 2.5 years! And Mrs. Matthews is awesome with the kids, especially my little one. If there is one thing I have to complain about is the class running late from time to time. In some cases understandable but most cases just a little frustrating. Not enough to take a star away.

"When we first started almost 4 years ago, I thought it would be a great way to keep the kids active and learn self defense.  It turns out much more than I expected, not only is their bodies strong but so is their mind!  They learned life skills like respect, loyalty, discipline, perseverance,  integrity to name a few. The kids have worked their way up in ranks and one made it to a state champion and is working extremely hard to make it to the worlds championships! Both kids are straight A  students and were not when they first started with Rico's.  What the kids have learned is to have goals in life and they must work for it (short or long term)! I am proud of who they are becoming and how they are dedicating themselves to a life of success!I would highly recommend Rico's Martial Arts to any parent!
",1
"After checking out other gyms throughout the valley, it was clear that Rico's Martial Arts was where we wanted to be! We chose Mr. Rico not only for the martial arts aspect for teaching self defense but the leadership program he offers. The lessons in life skills, are nothing but superior. Students are taught self defense, respect, self discipline and confidence. Mr. Rico is not only concerned about progress in his program, he takes high interest in his students education.  This was a very wise investment for us and we recommend it to everyone!! Stop by and watch one of the classes, you will not be disappointed !!

"If your child is timid, lacks confidence, and you want them to be more disciplined, respectful, and active, RMA is definitely what your child needs.  They have the BEST instructors! My now 5 and 7 year old boys have been attending the classes for almost a year now  and WOW! What a huge improvement in all the areas mentioned above!!!! My boys love attending the classes and they are pumped about being in the leadership classes now!!! Thanks RMA!!!!  This has become part of our family and lifestyle now!!!
",1
"Our son was never interested in any sports.  When a friend invited him to an open house at Rico's he really enjoyed it.  For this summer we thought we would give him a few weeks to decide if it was for him.  On his first day of instruction it was clear it meant he fit in somewhere and was welcomed.  Now he's learning respect and honor and his behavior has really improved.  He is not only learning self defense but gaining the confidence that will keep him from being a target to be picked on.  He comes home from school every day with the focus to work on his studies so he can get to class at Rico's Martial Arts.  I could go on and on about the many things our family has gained in such a short time with Ricco's help, but what I love most is how all the instructors and even the parents of all the kids are so pleasant and really make your whole family feel like you are part of something great for all the kids.

"What a difference this has made for my ADHD,very active son. It has given him focus,discipline,respect,confidence,motivation. He is in leadership program so he is there almost every weekday. Mrr. and Mrs. Rico's obviously are passionate about martial arts and kids!!! YES,it is pricey like all martial arts. BUT well worth having a son who is focused,disciplined,and respectful.

"Our son Jacob has been attending Rico's Martial Arts for 4 12 years sincehe was 3 years old. We feel that because of being a part of this RMAfamily that Jacob has become extremely mature for a 7 year old and haslearned to appreciate all types of people despite their age or ability.The students at this studio range from 3 to adult and all have a mutuallove and respect for each other. It is truly a family. My husband and Iconsider Mr. and Mrs. Rico to be second parents to Jacob over the yearsas in times of trial they have shared in helping us set goals andconsequences for our son and they provided another solid example forhim to follow of what is right and wrong. The children learn discipline,honor, integrity and the importance of helping others and doing well inschool. I highly recommend this martial arts studio to anyone.

"A really great traditional Chinese martial arts school. Definitely the most prominent in Las Vegas, as well as the most complete, welcoming, and inclusive. The students range in age from 6 or so to elderly people, and the breadth of available classes ranges from gentle Qigong and Yang Tai Chi Chuan, through more challenging Chen family Tai Chi and Ba Gua Zhang, all the way to the most challenging acrobatic Northern Shaolin and Praying Mantis KungFu. It's not chopsuey kung fu, or one of those stripmall colored belt factories...it's the real deal, and they really do serve the local community, with lion dancing at the New Year, as well as outreach programs and a strong spiritual emphasis at the center of the curriculum. Not just a meathead asskicking school, but I wouldn't recommend you starting any shit with them either.

"Funny about Lohan School...I went there from a suggestion of a friend of mine. This place is run by Sifu Steven Baugh and I knew that name...it turned out Sifu my friend in Jr High School's dad. Raul teaches there as well. It's a very welcoming environment. People there are friendly and teach many aspects of Kung Fu. Lohan is a non profit school which made it very appealing because they weren't trying to sell me a 200 dollar outfit or buy weapons in the black market. I loved going to the Spiritual Warrior classes. The community service they do is very admireable. I've seen them on Fox 11 news and doing lion dances during Chinese New Year, they have been to clubs to ward off the evil spirits and promote prosperity and health. I think Sifu is a great spiritual and community leader. This will be good for kids to help build their self esteem and get in shape for the great war with the Outlanders....uh whoops this isn't Mortal Kombat
",1
"I have been studying with Sifu Baugh since 2003.  My only complaint is that I didn't find him before 2003.  I have been studying since the 80's, and I have studied with some disreputable teachers.  Sifu teaches: Chen Tai Chi, Yang Tai Chi, Northern and Southern forms of Kung Fu, Praying Mantis, Xing Yi, Ba Qua, and other forms of traditional Kung Fu.  Unlike other teachers and schools I have attended, Sifu Baugh is approachable and humble.  He teaches the majority of the classes, and his only concern is helping you to get better.  He is respected by other martial arts teachers in town, and he even teaches some of them. If you are looking for a traditional Kung Fu school with: experienced and qualified instructors, reasonable monthly fees, no annual contracts, many different styles and classes, no ego, and a place that you can train for the rest of your life, then this is the place to train.

"I have been a part of the Lohan School of Shaolin for 4 years now, and it has been one of the most amazing experiences of my life. When I first heard of the school, my father took me in to watch the kung fu class and when I walked in, I felt this really strong positive energy, and right then and there, I wanted to join. The school is like a second home to me and the students are like another family. If you are looking for a good traditional kung fu school, this is definitely the place to go.

"I'm really into this bar, but only every now and then. they get a lot of the same kinds of requests, and they usually play them on rotation each weekend, so i wouldn't recommend coming every week.the musicians are good and have lively personalities. to make a request you write the song on a bar napkin and walk it up to the stage and drop it on the piano top with a couple of bucks (or more, depending on how badly you want to hear your song).p.s. unless you're a dummy dont' fall for the UofA v. ASU fight song battle. they do this every time i go in, and basically drunken bros try to ""outbid"" one another to hear one song over the other (during the rose bowl, etc, the respective teams are inserted). anyway, i've seen some poor way too drunk fool plop down $100 in effort to have his team song played over another - pretty smart gimmick for the players, pretty crappy for the dude who has to to realize, ""wait, did i really pay $100 to hear a song last night""i think the drink prices are steep here, but it's a fun time and you're getting live entertainment.

"I love this place. Its great for a fun relaxed night out, or for a friends birthday party or what have you. The music is good and interactive with the crowd, they help get you in a good mood. They take requests and do the best they can to sing everything they are asked, only once have they turned down one of mine, because they just didn't know it.If you go early between 5-8, they have fantastic drink specials aka happy hour. Beers, wines, wells are 2 bucks, everything else is 3 bucks. Can't beat that :). Also the earlier you go the easier it is to find the seat. Going after 8 it is almost impossible to find a table, and standing room is kind of limited. People some times say they play the same songs every night, and they do, because they know them, people request them all the time, and they are good group singing songs. And you have to admit to be up there playing the piano, drums or guitar and being to play a song on the spot with no music sheets is pretty awesome.

"Awesome place. Great atmosphere. I've been there a couple of times, on the weekends and in the middle of the week. Not exactly a place to mingle as it gets really loud, but if youre with a bunch of people you know you should have a nice time. Last time I went there was on a Tuesday and it was actually kinda busy. It was my friend's 21st bday and he did the whole getting on the stage thing. He tried to dance, but he wasnt that drunk yet. Afterwards someone gave him a 252 which he threw up almost right away. It wasnt chunky, and it wasnt a lot, but rules are rules. One of the bouncers followed him to the bathroom a little later and nicely asked us to leave. I have never been kicked out of a place in such a polite way before. (not that I get kicked out very often) We ended up running into the same bouncer at the Cue Club a few minutes later and he was cool and took a picture with us.All things considered, we had a good time. Don't Stop Believing, Piano Man and YMCA were some of the songs playing, and I'm pretty sure I ordered 3 drinks but only got charged for 2.

"FINALLY. I tried coming here one time before and the line was ridiculously long to get in. Now I have a good understanding of why so many people want to come here! It's POPPIN'!!! I wish they had a place like this in San Francisco where there are dueling pianos and drunken college folks who just sing along whether or not they know the lyrics.Cover was $6 I think but well worth it since the drinks are fairly inexpensive (from a city girl standard)...$6-7 roughly. You can request songs to the pianists but they'll really only get to your request if you throw in a few dollars for tip. One lady threw in $20 and her song was automatically played. She even got to sit up there with them. I would definitely come back to the Big Bang when I'm in town next. Bring a few friends, get a table in front (if possible) and enjoy the entertainment.

"Went here with the gf. Fun and entertaining place to drink and have a good time. First of all, good luck finding any eating whatsoever. Two pianos duke it out with classic songs and you can request songs with a tip. Don't think they only play cheesy showtunes. They do at times, and sometimes you can just sit there laughing at grown men belting out every word like they are own stage. Other times they drag unwilling people to stage and make them sing the words. All in all, a good time. Minus the Arizona heat.

"this is WAY better than karaoke and a thousand times more fun. Definitely not the scene for people who weren't raised on classic rock. if all you love is R & B and the only songs you know by heart are rap, you're not going to like it here (as much as i do!!!).I'm always stoked to come here and get to sing a little diddy about jack and diane, while together we lament the day the music died and have one last dance with mary jane until the midnight hour when we cried MORE MORE MORE! In the very end we'll put bread in their jars and say ""man, what are you doing here!""The Big Bang is a huge hit, with the entertainment truly making this place. i've come in here by myself, with a large group of people and with just a significant other. it doesn't matter who i'm with, we're all in here to get great drinks and shout great classic memories along with the (VERY) talented pianists... who all also double as drummer and bassistsguitarists. I highly recommend this barrel-of-monkeys type entertainment. but beware! the language gets foul and we all get a little rowdy. and if you didn't understand my paragraph on what gets me so stoked about this place, you're not going to ""get"" why so many people love it here.

"I've been a big fan of the shout house basically since they've opened, but now it's even better!  Cover has been reduced, only $8 after 7pm and ladies (woo that includes me!) are free after 10pm!  There's no cover during the week and all the same great entertainment!The service has also improved big time!  I think they got rid of the bad ones and got some good ones in there.  They even have a JELLO shot girl now, you can get them with whip cream and everything!  Another great thing is family nights on sundays. My friends have a youngster or two and its always great to find places to take them.  It's so cute to see them rockin out to the pianos!  Oh, and so you know its a G-rated show on sundays :) I love the shout house!  Every place has got its bumps, but nothing severe enough has happened to keep me away from this place!

"I rarely write reviews but this is my favorite place in glendale especially if you like live piano playing (I am a pianist my self and these guys are so talented; I could never in a million year do what they do and I have played classic piano for about 12 years!)I grew up in Glendale and know of only a few places to go on certain nights.  However, this place is great..  I assure you the musicians are great if you have a musical ear and a sense of humor.  They can pretty much play anything you request. Finally, they have pretty good drink specials and have very nice bartenders.  a sense of humor.

"I live this place. Great drinks. Awsome entertainment!!!! Not for the faint of heart. Profanity a plenty. But oh so Damn funny. The singers will commemorate engagements, wedding anniversaries, birthdays, and promotions (for a tip.) Such great interactive fun.

"I have wanted to go see a dueling piano show for forever, I had heard there is a place in Tempe off Mill, but that it gets crowded unless your super early and that didn't strike my fancy.  So when a friend said she is getting a group together on a Saturday to go check out the Shout House at Westgate I was all for it!We got to the Shout House about 7:30ish, and my friend who has been here before had reserved tables for the group and after been there for while a noticed that that is the way to go, the place fills up pretty quick and turns into standing room only.For me, it was a blast I love the look of a baby grand piano and to have 2 on stage next to each other, man that was hot, and to watch the guys fingers just fly over the keys, yea it was a good night for sure!But they have more than just piano playing going on, they even bust out with the guitar and beat some drums, and this amazing chick comes out and just plays her heart out on the violin, she was great, made playing the violin look cool, maybe I should have played that instead of the flute haha  They have good drink prices and even serve food, service was kind of slow, but she was handling a huge crowd, but I suspect that to be the same size crowd every weekend.The crowd had a great vibe, everyone smiling and singingshouting along. I am a music person so this place was for me, but if you don't like loud music or the neighbor next to you singing along as if she is Adele but really more like Sanjaya , or some impromptu dancing and shouting happening, then this might not be the place for you, but me it was a great time and I will be back!

"Love it here! Best bar at Westgate!I'm not usually the bar going type but I really enjoy this particular one and I don't feel like people are bumpin' and grindin' all over the place (uncomfortable!). Came here with some friends last weekend and we all had a great time and its enjoyable for the designated driver as well ;)

"I personally LOVEEE this place. Me and my friend come here every wednesday for the $1 drinks, and sometimes on the weekend. The bartender pours really good drinks. The pianists are really talented and great at singing and playing the other instruments. Overall, its a lot of fun. (:

"Love this place, getting older (25) not about the dance clubs anymore the music is good the beer is cheap and I always have a good time. The staff is awesome to.

"Pro: drunks singing, public insults, friendly atmosphere Con: upstairsCame here late hour wondering Phoenix solo on a business trip, stumbled upon this gem by chance. I already know the Shout House well from the SD location... and wouldn't you know it, one of the player on the piano was on loan from SD. So, drinking and singing, I managed to get a song in (part of the your world)... too bad it was a weeknite and the place closed early. Next time I am in Phoenix, I would be coming back for more.

"My new favorite breakfast spot in Montreal. No lineups, spacious & most importantly DELICIOUS! I ordered the crab cakes with eggs, oh so good! My friends ordered the Mexican dish and eggs benedicts, their verdicts, excellent!

"Friends suggested meeting for brunch at Griffintown Cafe and we were not disappointed.  The wait staff were tremendous and actually let us in out of the cold a little before the restaurant opened.  We were there with an infant which tends to complicate things at most restaurants, but they were well set up and didn't give it a second thought.We tried the bacon and eggs mac and cheese as well as the eggs benedict.  The mac and cheese was made with about 4 kinds of cheese and topped with their homemade bacon (which is amazing) and two perfectly poached eggs.  It was heavy, but delicious.  The eggs benedict was also incredible.  Not too much hollandaise and homemade bacon instead of ham.  The kicker was a homemade biscuit for the base.  It all came together very nicely.Griffintown Cafe was very kid friendly with amazing food and excellent staff.  We couldn't have asked for a better brunch and will definitely be back.

"My boyfriend and I found this place on Yelp and went for brunch during a weekend trip to Montreal.  It was fantastic.  He ordered the huevos divorciados and I had the bacon egg mac & cheese.  Being from Texas, we were leery about ordering a Mexican inspired dish- but we were not disappointed!  The dishes came out piping hot- a very important factor for a delicious breakfast.  We ate at the bar and we spent a couple of hours lingering after our meal visiting with the staff, the chef and his wife.  We had plans to go visit a couple of museums but we ended up spending the entire afternoon just hanging out at Griffintown, a happy accident and a very memorable Sunday afternoon.
",1
"Have been here a few times for breakfast and once in the evening, so I'll split the review in to two: Breakfast - while there's always a line up, it's well worth the wait. The place is noisy, but that's just because it's one big space (including all the seating, the bar, and the kitchen) and popular. I don't find it a problem, but if you want a quiet spot to escape the noise, then you don't want to come here.While you're waiting for a table, try to squeeze in at the bar to order a coffee (it's really good here) - it makes the wait that much more bearable.The G Biscuit with bacon is my favourite savoury meal - it's not too big, super tasty, and cooked to perfection. On the sweet side I really like their french toast - nothing too crazy, just solid french toast goodness.Evening - much more chillaxed. I had the burger and pint Wednesday special for $18, and wasn't disappointed. The burger patty is a mix of beef, lamb, and duck, and tastes as good as it sounds! I can't remember what beer they have on tap, but it's good.

"Sign me up for a weekly eat here, please Someone Please. Arriving starved after a morning train ride from Ottawa, I was seated on the terrasse. Snuggly wedged into my seat (which was also propping open the door to the restaurant) I got down to brass tacts: bennies and bevies. I ordered absolutely, positively correctly. The house cured wild salmon benny was a perfect blend of salty, sweet, pickled, and smoky flavour. And the mountain of potato mash with bites of onions I could have easily eaten double! Griffintown seems to be a restaurant that enjoys homemaking their wares. Much to my joyful surprise, they also had homemade ginger beer. And yes, it too was delicious. I searched for something wrong with experience, but truthfully, it was just a big breakfast-at-lunch-time love fest.

"I don't mean to bump Crystal's review - but we LOVED this place! We love the food, the service. Cannot wait to return again! This is an amazing gem we discovered through yelp in Montreal!Good for groups: if you sit inside. It is a small quaint gastropub.Dinner: I ate the Griffintown Cheeseburger which is a delicious monsterBrunch: Crab Cakes with Eggs = divine!

"Best Bloody Caesar in Montreal!!  Yes we were visiting but we had many in different cafes and restaurants. We could have drank 20... did we.. who knowsBreakfast was good. I tried the homemade gravlax and yes!! so good with my poached eggs. Egg sandwich The scene cool, hip and mellow. The background music was wonderful. Loved it. I also liked the neighborhood.

"I don't know anything about wine, but I like to support any business that moves into the area so I though I'd check this Gigino's out.The ambiance is good and the night we went there was a live guitar player that was really good. He played almost the entire time we were in the restaurant. The food was fantastic, in fact probably the best quality food I've had in the city of Goodyear. The hummus was great (and free, thanks to a coupon that came in the mail) as was the warm pita bread. The hummus is a house recipe that is made on site. For dinner we got one of their boards and everything was great. It was a combination of your choices of meat, cheeses and bread that was of the highest quality and tasted fantastic. I also had the wine that was recommended by the waiter, which was a good fit.Gigino's is really a one of a kind place in Goodyear and hopefully they will be around for a long time.

"Anyone who lives in Phoenix's west valley knows that our side of the hood isn't exactly, err, bustling with independent local businesses. Everywhere you look it's big box stores and chains, and while many of the employees are lovely and personable, they're just not invested like they are in good old mom and pop shops. Enter Gigino's. Owned by a REAL DEAL Italian dude and his lovely wife, this place has some CRAZY good food. I'm fairly picky when it comes to my eats, so I don't say this lightly -- they made the BEST panini I've ever had in my life. Let me back up and set the stage for you a bit. I came here with my husband on his birthday, intending to have a glass of wine and some tapas -- the valpack coupon offering a free hummus drew me in. We entered this restaurantwine bar, which is nicely decorated and has a variety of fun different seating options (you can eat at the piano!!!), and were surprised to find it fairly empty on a Thursday evening. Happy hour was going on, so we enjoyed some $5 bruschetta, a glass of their house wine special for me, and a big craft beer for the birthday man. The Italian owner, whose name I can't recall, was very attentive and chatty without being overbearing, and when he found out it was my man's birthday, he proceeded to bring us two comp glasses of champagne. Nice! After enjoying our sips and snack, we decided to dive in to the paninis. We ordered two -- one with prosciutto, sun dried tomatoes, and a few other things I can't recall which was great, and one manchego cheese, some type of delicious meat, fig jam, and pears, grilled on sourdough that was out-freakin-standing. Oh. My. Goodness. Eat this right now. I savored every bite of this panini and told pretty much everyone I know and work with about it. For dessert, we had a pastry with nutella which was also tasty, but didn't compare to the panini. Overall, I'm a huge fan of this place. Great service, authentic people and food, AND locally owned. I sure hope they make it here, because I am looking forward to years of paninis. Mmm!

"YEAH!!! A wonderful and cozy little wine bar just around the corner from home with a warm and genuine owner-operator staff that are more worried that you have a pleasant experience than giving you a check and the door.  A constantly changing wine list with suggestions and pairings that come from a staff that learn to know your likes and dislikes.  Want to buy a bottle but don't want to get a DUI on the way home  They'll mark your bottle and keep it there for you or recork it for the ride home.  The food is all fresh ingredients with well matched flavors.  Love it!!!

"Another great local family owned small business find.  I just happened to be driving back from LA was hungry checked my around me app and found this little jewel.  Fantastic wine list great lite bites met the owner and her (willing to work harder than most adults I know) kids.  Loved the piano playing in the back ground.  It is not often in AZ you find this kind of stuff, with out spending an arm and a leg.  In this time of financial uncertainty Christy and her family are making it work.  If you live or are visiting the Goodyear area for Spring training a wedding or what ever reason please check this place out.   It is small businesses like this that keep our country running.My personal thought please leave your kids at home this is very much an adult night out kind of place

"I thought it might be odd to write a review about a spiritual spot...but sometimes I feel Macy's is my personal heaven so here goes. For those of you looking to connect deeper with yourself and the world, and want a non committed affiliation, check this place out. Its not your typical church experience- the place is founded on Science of Mind which is NOTTTTTTTTTTT Scientology or even close. If you have seen The Secret, read books by Louise Hay, or hopped on the Power of Now wagon, you understand the basic teachings of The Law of Attraction and changing your thinking, changes your life. Anyways, it is a perfect place to set aside an hour on Sunday to get back to basics. You can believe in any higher power and be cool here. The people are nice, don't corner you and the talk is always relate able to real life.Wishing you all the best on your own journey!

"My uncle Rick is a member of this church so when my grandfather passed away, naturally, he wanted to do a memorial to Grandpa at his place of worship. I'm not a religious person but I did come here one other time with my uncle (I took a world religions class and Rick took me here). My first impression is that its such a beautiful church with symbols of various religious icons and a laid back atmosphere. The people seem to genuinely love it here and feel comfortable being in the presence of their pastor() Rev. Mitzi Lynton. She was well spoken, not pushy and not saying ""God this and Jesus that"". She told the congregation ,my family, to take a deep breath and say your own prayer for him as he was a father,husband, brother, grandfather, brother-in-law, father-in-law etc...you get the idea. I found that t o be super. They put up a few appetizers with water, tea and wine and gave our family room to mingle and greet eachother etc..The girls who helped were on top of everything! They respect one anothers  faith and belief system. I definately think i will be going back and checking out a real service. Thanks to my uncles friends who helped with everything from food, song choices, flowers and loving support.

"This place is AMAZING. They welcome every human being. There was no judgment, just ACCEPTANCE. There was no negativity, just POSITIVITY. I went in with apprehension. I usually go by the philosophy, ""take what you like and leave the rest""when I left, I actually took 100% of my experience with me, which included a smile.

"These people open their hearts and welcome everyone. Your not just tolerated, you are accepted and loved. They don't shove religion down your throat. They teach love! They are Science of Mind, not not not Scientology. Not anything like it! If you are lookinng for an up beat spiritual experience, go there. I am so happy to have found CLF.

"While my beliefs are different than them as I am Christian the attitudes and behaviors I have seen here are heads and shoulders above what I have experienced at many Christian Churches. I have attended on a regular basis and greatly enjoy my time and experience here on the Sundays that I am able to attend. They are open and accepting of all people. There are different lifestyle's that I don't necessarily agree with but it is not my place to judge but to treat with respect and dignity that each human being deserves. This is what I see here. Rev Michelle is a class act and a genuine caring person. Life is to short to condem others and that does not be occur here.

"LOVE Psycho Jock. My company was having a hard time finding someone who could embroider one of our logos and still make it look classy. Not only did Psycho Jock pull it off, they did it in a very short time frame. John, one of the owners, actually came all the way down to our office (a 45-60 minute drive) on a Saturday to bring us samples. Then, one of the employees met me half way to deliver the shirts. Great customer service plus high quality work. I'm a fan.
",1
"Great experience with Psycho Jock on my low volume order. They make good on the customer service claim that they service ""needs as small as 1 hat, to 5,000 shirts"", as I only wanted two shirts done, and they treated me as if I was getting 200 hundred. Neal is awesome. He listened to what I was looking for and his communication was fast and professional. The whole thing, from first communication to finish was done in around a week, which met our extremely tight deadlines. I had never had embroidery of our logo done, and Neal created sew-outs in two sizes so I could pick the best one for my project. We selected the one that met our needs, and the final product turned out great. Very proud of the shirts that Psycho Jock created for us. Can't wait for our next trade show when I can show them off. Hoping we can find some more stuff to do and come back to Psycho Jock.

"My oh My! If you're in Las Vegas and love cross stitch, do NOT miss this shop. The front of the shop has got the more current chartslittle kitsseasonal charts so you have to run the gauntlet of great stuff before you can even greet the shop owner.

"A GREAT shop in a great part of town.Yarnhouse has it all.... a great selection of needles (Chiagoo DPNs are my favorite), fantastic yarns, and very fair prices.  The best thing about it is when I go to Yarnhouse, I get to visit with Chris.  He's fantastic, down to earth, and not at all pretentious as some yarn store employeesowners seem to be.I especially love how many great LOCAL yarn lines and indie dyers that Chris stocks.  In a city with so many choices as far as yarn shops go, Chris is ALWAYS the first one I visit!

"I love this place. I found it today and had a one on one lesson in crochet. Chris was so patient and kind. I left with some great new tools to help me stay on track and a boost of needed confidence. This place is so awesome. They have crochet and knitting circle meetings on Wednesday nights at 6pm. I can't wait to try it out. Thank you Chris. I am so excited about my new project.
",1
"I adore Yarnhouse. I've taken two classes there that have been incredible. Really small class sizes, with great individual attention for your needs. I've also just walked in and asked for help with a pattern before. Even though I didn't buy the yarn at their store, Chris helped me figure out the issue I was having and let me sit there for more than an hour while I took out my stitches and tried again. He's also helped walk me through what kind of yarn would be good for different products and even helped me fix a crochet afghan that was literally falling apart at the seams! Even though I know that I could find cheaper yarn online or at a big box store, I would never get the help, advice and great customer experience that Yarnhouse gives me!

"I have been a subscriber to the Pittsburgh Opera for 5 years.  I have also attended the opera in other cities, most notably New York City and Sidney, and I feel that we are very lucky to have such an excellent company in Pittsburgh.  The season usually provides lots of variety, and the artistic standards are very high.  The Benedum itself is a magnificent venue to attend an opera, they have done a wonderful job restoring this historic building.  The acoustics of the Benedum are also really excellent.  The super titles are easy to read from just about any seat.  The orchestra is well rehearsed and play beautifully.  I also think that most people have  misconceptions about opera which can be easily be proved wrong by visiting the Pittsburgh Opera.

"Over the past five years, I've been to this convention center four times and have enjoyed each time here. It's an impressive and well maintained building that provides both locals and out-of-towners with a good impression of the city. The first time at the center, I lived in NC and was attending a big work event here. I was very impressed by the architecture of the center but sadly wasn't in an area where I could see beautiful views of the city. After moving to Pittsburgh, I came for the annual home show and auto show. Though I liked both shows, the auto show was a bit more impressive. I hear that the home and garden show is a must-attend! Finally, I came here for the Boden liquidation sale yesterday. The views from the line to enter (where I sat for a looong time) were absolutely stunning! The section of the center overlooked the river and the North Shore with a bridge flanking both sides of the view. I didn't mind the wait just because I could admire the view. I look forward to coming back for the home and garden and auto shows in 2014!

"I LOVE THIS PLACE.  It is less expensive than area hotels:  for less than the price of one normal hotel room at a hotel located in a less desirable area, you get your own apartment nestled comfortably in Shadyside.  You really become a resident of the area and don't feel much like a guest.The customer service was great over the phone.  We were given the university rate for the room due to my father's affiliation with Pitt, and that made a good deal even better.  There's fancy cable, enough room that a family of four won't trip all over each other, and one of my favorite hoods within a short walking distance.  I LOVE THIS PLACE.  I recommend it without reservation.  Truly.
",1
"My husband and I went to visit my nephew at Carnegie Mellon.  It was our first time in Pittsburgh, so we wanted something close to him.  The Shadyside Inn was PERFECT for our stay.  We are very, very, well traveled, and are extremely selective about where we stay.  I can say without a shadow of a doubt that we will be staying here again the next time we come back.  In fact we tried, but the dates we wanted were completely sold out :-(The location is perfect, and only a 5 minute walk from the shops and restaurants on Walnut Street.  You don't even need a car.  The Inn is a series of nicely renovated apartment buildings, so they are all equipped with well-stocked kitchens (my husband is a chef so he was very impressed by that).  The front desk person was sweet and friendly.  Not only did he check us in immediately, he gave us a ""breakfast bag"" full of muffins, juices, and granola bars!  Then he told us that he upgraded us to a suite, even tho we only booked a studio.   Well, when we got into our room, not only was it a suite, but it was a 2 BR suite!  I couldn't believe it.  It was bigger than our apartment back home.  Right then and there I wished we were staying longer - like a month!The suite had a giant flat screen TV, a big dining area, with room service menu, free wi-fi, and super comfy furniture.  The bed was to die for.  The only thing that didn't go was the older, un-renovated bathroom tiles & fixtures, but it really didn't bother us at all, because the shower water pressure was great.  There is ample parking out back, and the service people out taking care of the gardens and rooms were friendly and courteous.When we checked out, they were renovating the main office, so it's nice to see that they are constantly striving to update and improve.  Checkout took less than 30 seconds.  I handed her my key, and they told me they would email me a copy of my bill, since I used my credit card to book.  Everything went so smoothly, and the staff was so wonderful.  We LOVED our stay here and would come back in a heartbeat!

"When you first drive up to Shadyside you don't expect much, but we were very much happy with what we got.  The parking lot does have a steep driveway but not too bad.  We went to the lobby and we were met by two ladies who immediately offer us water and cookies. Before leaving the lobby we were given a bag for a Sunday breakfast.  In the bag, bottle of orange juice, apple juice, two small muffins, two granola bars and mints.  The room we were put in look like a small  apartment.  Living roomdinning area and kitchen.  It also had two separate bedrooms, one was a single and the other was full.  This place was very clean and comfortable.This is my second time in Pittsburgh, the first time we stayed in a hotel, we had to pay for parking, go to an elevator to take us up to the lobby and take another elevator to get to our room and had to pay for WI-Fi.  I would recommend Shadyside and would love to stay there again and again.

"Once a year for the past 10+ years we've been staying here.  You canNOT beat the location.  You can walk to shops and restaurants and the area is safe.  The staff has always been above average.  A few years ago the rooms were rundown but since they have renovated and the rooms couldn't be better.  A hotel doesn't give you that much room - you literally have your our own apartment.  I was there last week because a family member died.  We were having relatives visit us at Shadyside Inn and the staff went out of their way to deliver chairs to our rooms.  Our rooms were cleaned every day and there are very few places that allow dogs - and they do!  Their prices are reasonable and I wouldn't stay anywhere else while in PA.  Thank you Shadyside!

"We got a great price from expedia, similar to hotels in the area but here you get a great apartment style place with full kitchen, living room and two bedrooms (great for kids).  Fresh cookies and bottled water on check in and a small breakfast bag for the morning. Parking is tight but within walking distance of some decent restaurants and shops. Well recommended.

"This place is awesome. Immaculately clean, lots of natural light in every room of the enormous suites, modern decor, great location, and amazing customer service. You really feel like you are at home. Such a wonderful experience. I will definitely be a returning guest.

"5 Stars all the way. Front desk attendant ""Christian"" went above and beyond the call of duty. He has a great attitude and is very personable. He is an asset the the Holiday Inn brand. We were grieving the loss of loved one and he was completely compassionate. We can tell he loves his job ! I will always stay at Holiday Inns for now on.

"I hosted a bachelorette party for my sister at this location and overall everything was wonderful. There were a few customer service issues I had that I'd like to mention so that others are aware. 1- I booked the block of rooms 3 months in advance via the 1-800 number on the website. I have a military ID and requested the military discount. I was given the discounted rate for all 5 rooms and was told I only needed to present my ID upon arrival. Unfortunately, when I arrived the girl at the check-in counter told me that I could not have all 5 rooms at the discounted rate, that I could only have two of them. I pitched a royal fit and 40 minutes later they gave me all 5 rooms at the rate that I was quoted. Bad way to start a fun occasion.2- I emailed back and forth with Tracy Bernstein about specifics that I needed for this gathering I was hosting (iPod player, Microwave, Fridge, Early Check-in). I was told these things would be ready and they were not. We never got the iPod player, Microwave or Fridge. Bad customer service, Tracy.NOW, I'd like to tell you about the wonderful things at Holiday Inn City Center. 1- Very clean and modern. I loved the decor and it made great back drops for my photography.2- The rooms had adjoining doors which made it very easy for our guests to mingle.3- Jay Jay at the front desk was so friendly and helpful. He arranged a private limo service for us beautiful ladies for a great price. I've been told he has the ""hookup"" so make sure you get with him if you need anything special. 4- Adam is the food and beverage manager and he was so good to me. He offered to bring a 6 foot table in to our room with table cloths for FREE. Are you serious FREE He even came by the room to make sure we got all that I requested and warn us about the no noise policy starting at 11pm. We very happily toned it down by that point. The stay at the hotel was wonderful and the event was great. I really appreciate all that helped me at the hotel to make this event special!

"I stayed at this particular holiday inn last week  If you check my previous reviews I always stay in a holiday inn or candlewood when I travel (IHG brand).  While 9 out of 10 are good experiences this one takes the cake.  Based on yelp reviews we knew ahead of time about the parking fee (it is unavoidable in the center of the city)At least it is only a 1 time fee and they validate it for your stay.  After parking we go to hotel lobby to check in and were greeted by a very nice and helpful receptionist (I wish I remembered her name).  She told us that we had the best room in the entire hotel, and I truly believe it. Our room was 15th floor room 1534.  It was on the corner so we got 2 walls of windows, one side had a great view of uptown (not the arena which is behind the hotel), and the ceilings were over 12 feet high. Our king bed was comfy as always, and I always fall asleep quickly on them.The hotel itself is furnished in a contemporary style, and will appeal to 9 out of 10 people.  It is located one block from the Epicenter, and only a block or two from the lightrail system for easy commuting.    The one time we had to leave parking was to travel about 3.5 miles to go to an auditorium (we saw Wicked, and it was fantastic).  Other than that there was no reason to drive anywhere since you are close to everything in uptown.  In the beginning of my post I said that my boyfriend and myself always stay in a variety of the Holiday Inn brand hotels.  For anybody looking into hotels, I suggest you sign up for their rewards system, whether or be this one (priority club) or another chains version of it.  Hotels reward loyalty, and will do a lot to keep you loyal.  We did our research and liked the IHG brand (everything from Holiday inn express to Intercontinental)for a few reasons; they are literally everywhere so we knew that when we travel we can stay with them and continue earning points, and price-wise they stay competitive.  Our room preferences are already saved to our account (free to create).  So as a tip to everybody do a little research into hotels rewards programs, then stick to it.  If you stay with a hotel chain ten times a year, they will do a little more to keep you happy, and make up for any bad experiences you might have along the way. When I first started out with my Priority Club membership I highly doubt they would have upgraded me to the 15th floor with some of best views in the whole hotel, but because of my loyalty to them they rewarded me (at no additional cost).  The room was only $97, and that really can't be beat  for this location.

"My wife booked my son and I for a fatherSon weekend to the GiantsPanthers game. I had no idea a Holiday Inn could be so nice. It offered everything the top hotels had in my years of traveling. The decor, room, location were all 5 stars! The front desk and valet parking were top notch! I needed to charge my phone and iPad before the game and the valet brought my car down so we could sit and charge it. After we were done he parked it again with a smile.We will absolutely be back! Thank you for a wonderful stay!

"Perfect location with a warm friendly staff.  What more could you ask for  Everyone from the valets to front desk staff were wonderful.  Our room was clean and looked to have been remodeled in the last couple of years.  When we mentioned we were in Charlotte for a sick relative, kids in tow, and that it was our anniversary, they delivered chocolate covered fruit to our room.  If you book through their website, the prices are very reasonable.

"Probably not one of my more timely reviews...St. Mary's apparently began its life as the chapel of an orphanage (which itself is no longer standing).  Now it is just the chapel, which is used for weddings - I suppose other events could take place there as well, but weddings are far and away the most popular event at the chapel.Take note of that if you plan to get married there (as we did).  We went in late January and they were booked through August.  This means that every possible slot was filled - in two-hour increments - more than seven months in advance.  In other words, plan ahead.As luck would have it, browsing one page at a time, we managed to find a single slot that had been canceled, so we grabbed it, and that lone factor is what sealed our wedding date (a mere two months from our engagement date, rather less than that from the time we went to find a venue).  But we are very glad it did, because the location itself rocks.Nestled just outside the 277 loop, on the grounds of Thompson Park (also the site of the Vietnam Veterans memorial), the chapel and the park offers a nice respite from the busy-ness of Uptown while being close to everything.  The trees provide great cover, so you barely know you are so close to the city, and inside it is like you have stepped back in time.  You can even have your organist play a harpsichord (if they are able).Since our wedding party was intimate - just the immediate family - we had the whole group entirely on the raised dais, which provided a nice treat to everyone, rather than scattering them in the pews, which would have separated everyone far too much (for larger parties, it would certainly be fine).  Big thumbs up.

"Beautiful littel chapel, not a Church, this facility is now only used for Weddings and it is pretty good idea and location for that, small chapel with large grounds and the weather was great for photos, i was a little hurt that i was not shooting my first wedding, then later releaved and glad my friend and yeas he is a jock of course explained that his brides mom needed to be the one to chose the photographer, i gleamed so ideas from himback to the review, this place does have that Historic look and fell to it and the cordinator was cool as she could be for our group, or one half of, to be so disorganized, bet she did not plan on being a zookeeper that day, she remained as calm as ive seen, so she gets high marks totightly scheduled for a party known for lateness, not me a caught a ride with the puncual few, wich means the groom picked me up, ok they give you more than enough time if you get there on time, ive said too much about my friends wife and her family,mmmuhwhat about the honeymoon good question and i do not want to know, my friend is 19 and his bride is in her 20s so they could have stayed in Matthews or Pineville and saved some monetthanks to everyone for liking my reviews, i'm back

"This was my favorite joint in the CLT.  I have never been to New Orleans, and because of Katrina, I probably  won't for awhile, but I imagine that this is a pretty good joint even by looziana standards.  I always get the blackened platter with chicken and the fish special with one of their rotating toppings, usually  one with crawfish and corn and a side of gumbo.  MMMMMMMMMM

"Authentic New Orleans flavor and great family atmosphere.  Not pricey, and the portions are huge.  The fish is fresh, and the service is friendly.  Live music some nights.

"I LOVE this restaurant. So far, I have only been twice, but boy I wish I could afford to go weekly! My boyfriend and I just went for Valentine's Day. Had a reservation, got there a little early, and were still seated immediately, and in the jazz room too! (Side note: the female singer they had on Valentine's was INCREDIBLE. Wish I got her name) My boyfriend and I absolutely LOVE the rolls they give everyone, possibly the best rolls I've had at any restaurant. For my drink, I ordered the chocolate martini, my favorite! Oh, and of course a Hurricane later, also deliciousFor my entree I had the special Tilapia with the crawfish topping. OH! First, let me mention, the gumbo that comes before the entree is AMAZING. I don't care if it's not authentic! Who cares about authenticity when the food is THAT good. I ate that gumbo so fast my boyfriend was making comments like, ""Slow down, it's not going anywhere!"" It had a little bit of a kick to it, which I don't normally like, but the flavor was just too good! Now, back to the entree. Last time, I ordered the same thing, but I didn't even try the crawfish topping; I just gave it all to my mom. This time, however, I realized what a mistake that was! I've actually never had crawfish before, so I have nothing to compare theirs to, but it was delicious, and I'm already craving more! The tilapia, like the first time, was also to-die-for. I will admit I'm biased because I like tilapia pretty much anywhere I go as long as they cook it right, but my boyfriend seemed to like it as well. He also loved his salmon special with the shrimp topping (as did I!).Unfortunately, neither of us were able to leave room for dessert, so I have nothing to say about that. Overall, this place is definitely in my top 3 restaurants in Charlotte now. The only problem is the parking, which is almost unavoidable whenever you go there. It's such a tiny place with barely any parking, but I'd rather deal with the parking than have them move to another location. The tiny old building, along with the jazz music playing, makes me feel like I've gone back in time. It's such a cozy, romantic restaurant. Definitely a great choice for Valentine's Day, and even my extremely picky, high-maintenance boyfriend (I love him, but he is!) agreed. Believe me, he wasn't lying. He wouldn't hesitate to tell me if I picked a bad restaurant! lol.

"Food:  Fried Oysters were nice and crispy on the outside and delightfully gooey on the inside.. The perfect spice for both the oysters and the shrimp.  On the main course... Lay down a bed of rice, throw some ""jerk like"" chicken and two different kinds of red bean delicousness and BAM... You are set!   Now, I like my food to have a KICK but this was, what I would call, a controlled KICK.  Just enough spice to get the tongue and mouth salivating and begging for more.  You could always add some more Louisiana hot sauce if you wanted.  Then, to top it off.... bread pudding.. Oh Lordy Lord Lord, the bread pudding.. SOOOOOooo good.  I would go back just for the bread pudding.  AtmosphereStaff:  Bo, the bartender made a mean Hurricane and had extensive knowledge of the shrimp apps that proved to be very helpful.  Everything about the two story restaurant was uniquely decorated and made you feel comfortable and relaxed.  The upstairs outdoor patio was quaint and cozy with a classy touch.  Overall, simply wonderful.  Please give it a try.. You wont regret it.   Enjoy-Ian M.

"Awesome etouffee.  It actually isn't as spicy as I thought it'd be.  I got the shrimp, chicken, and crawfish combo.  Actually wish i didn't get the chicken (even though it was super tender), I just didn't get as much rice...which probably would have been really good with the sauces.  Other than that....pretty cool music by local musicians....great ambiance and good times.  =)If work sends me back out here again, I wouldn't mind coming back...

"I'm pretty particular about 'where' i see shows.  A crappy venue can kill a good artist and put up a good fight against a great one.Fortunately, The Rhythm Room needn't worry about quashing the entertainment value of one of their nationally touring acts.  And the RR really does get some of the best independent acts on tour.  For artists worthy of smallish venues, this place should be as legendary as the Whiskey in Hollywood, but unfortunately, its located on, like the kiddie ride portion of Los Angeles, central Phoenix.For a venue, they have really smokin deals on alcohol, like PBR for $2.50.  Considering that you couldn't get that deal ANYWHERE playing live music, i consider it a humongous bargain.  They have a smoking patio that you can still hear the music during those 5 mins, and the venue is easy to get in and out of.It DOES tend to get crowded once the main act is on, especially near the bar, but I've never waited more than a couple of minutes for a drink and i can always find a good view of the stage.When acts like Bob Schneider come around, the place is ROWDY.  Indie acts like VHS or Beta and Midlake are near priceless to see in such a small joint.and sometimes shows that pique too much interest will be moved to their big cousin Marquee.

"Oh Rhythm Room, how I adore thee!I have seen some of the greatest Blues legends play here and have never been disappointed.   Whenever The Rhythm Room All-stars play, I definitely try to make it.  They are rockin'.  I dig the dancing, the bbq (mmmmmm)  and I enjoy when the f*ck the police guy is roller skating on the dance floor!I do recommend getting there early if you want a table and a chair.  For bands I really want to see I get there before they open, get in line, get a table, then someone in my party goes to grab us some bbq and we start drinking and eating and waiting for the music to start!  I always have a great time here!  And now that you can't smoke it's even better!

"I have yet to find a better blues, jump blues, swing, etc... venue in Phoenix.So, on the Phoenix scale of music venues it gets 5 stars.Yes, it's a dive. Which is a good thing.  No pretentious personalities at the Rhythm Room. Cheep beer, a decent dance floor, decent sound and great music are all that really matter.  Rhythm Room has them all.  It kinda reminds me of the Foothill (R.I.P.) in Long Beach, CA. And that's a good thing. I miss the Foothill dearly.Also, what is possibly the best show (Mates of State), out of hundreds I've ever seen in many cities across the U.S.,  was at the Rhythm Room.

"This place has a great little vibe and fantastic music. I have to admit, I'm not very hip when it comes to the Blues but I definitely enjoy listening to it when given the chance. It was a nice change to look into the crowd and see 21-year-old college students, to middle age moms, to retired couples all getting down and dancing. You rarely see such an eclectic mix of people, from every color of the rainbow, and all ages, just enjoying the music. The few times I've been there have been quite an experience, and I always leave very happy to have found a place like this in Phoenix. The drinks are super cheap, the sound is good, and the music is wonderful!

"The Rhythm Room was the first blues bar I visited when I moved here to Arizona. I randomly showed up for their fall music festival.  I saw so many great local acts that I had no idea existed! And It was my first introduction to Big Pete Pearson.  That guy puts on a GREAT show and always interacts with the crowd and will talk to any random bar patron who wants to praise his performance or just talk music. The RR is also really good about showcasing newer bands from all over the country of all genres. The drinks are cheap, the bartenders are awesome and always show ample cleavage. The crowd on any given night ranges from the young hipsters to the AARP crowd who still dress up for a night on the town with cocktails and dancing. There is no pretension here.  I love this place and everytime I go, I wonder why I've been away for so long.

"Rhythm Room- by far PHX's best venue. It will be no shocker in 2010 when every concert goer in PHX becomes acquainted with Rhythm Room.

"I went here years ago when I was young and enjoyed dancing. I always felt sort of exposed the way the seating was. There is that long row of bar stools that makes you feel on display. Now I prefer listening to music rather than dancing to it (except at home where I often break into dance for no reason whatsoever.) So now I say I love you Rhythm Room. You make me feel like Goldilocks except without the long walk in the woods and home burglary part. You are not to hot, not to cold, you are just right. Not to big, not to small, again... you got it right. And I haven't even broken a bar stool yet. Nor have I fallen asleep while at the Rhythm Room. I am done with the young hip scene I use to visit at the Emerald Lounge, before it was turned into a Starbucks. If I go someplace like that now it always seems too loud and my personal space always feels violated. I still feel to young for the lounge act at Scottsdale's blahblahblah so where do I fit in Where do I fit in Where can I go for good music and not stand out like a, well, just not stand out. I dislike big crowds and arenas. Small venues are fine if you are not the only audience member and will be missed if you need to get up to pee.  The beer is cold but my friends who prefer a gin and tonic can also be taken care of. The people who work there are nice, no attitude, and are actually very cool. If it gets a little crowded or if you feel like chatting someone up they have a patio. Finally I have found a place where I can blend in and listen to the music I love. Bowerbirds, check. St. Vincent, check. Now, if you could just book Grizzly Bear it would be true love and I would live happily ever after.

"Woah, this place is great!  On my first visit I walked in and was immediately greeted by 4 different ""hello""'s, ""welcome""'s, and smiling faces.  What a warm welcome right off the bat.It was a little hard to find, but once you find it, you will be so glad you did.  Their food is amazing!  I have been twice now and have had their pork chops, hot links, and chicken wings, all were perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked, and tasted excellent!  I was a bit hesitant with the hot links, as often they come way too greasy for my taste, but these were grilled to perfection and not overly greasy.  I was very impressed.  I have also tried their dirty rice (spicy and dirty with ground beef, great!), black eyed peas, and their french fries.  The fries were just fries, but seasoned well.... everything else was spot on.  I really enjoyed their dirty rice.  I've had a lot of different types of dirty rice, and this was very unique and very tasty.Their chicken deserves its own paragraph here.  Seriously.  I order their fried chicken ""not battered"", so they basically season the chicken and drop it in the deep fryer.  OMFG.  I've eaten my share of fried chicken, but their chicken, by far, is better than anything I have ever eaten..... easy.  In fact, my mouth is literally watering as I type this.  Go, eat their chicken. The environment was nice... low light, dark decor, great old school tunes being spun by a dj on the 1's and 2's. Don't worry, if you don't eat wheat or gluten, just tell them and they will make sure your meal is made without, no issues here.  Very accommodating.

"This place had the most AMAZING meatloaf, fried chicken, and mac & cheese. I also ordered a side of greens which were good but a little too salty for me. I don't order meatloaf at restaurants mainly because I know it'll probably be dry or have no flavor, but I had this feeling that Bobby C's would make it perfectly. I wasn't disappointed. It had this slight crunchiness on the outside that was like little heavenly crunchy bits. The fried chicken beat the pants off of any other soul food restaurant I've been to. It was so juicy and to die for. The mac and cheese was another hit. Next time I'm going to order the mashed potatoes and gravy as well! The staff was really friendly and the atmosphere was loungy with great old school tunes being played on their nice sound system.

"If you like blues, this is where you go.  Period.  There's really not much more to say.  Blues and jazz bands play here almost every night of the week.  Drinks are cheap and the music's fantastic.

"Wouldn't change a thing about the Sand Dollar.  Great music... check, dive bar... check, out of the way location... check.  All these elements make for a true blues bar in a city where artifice has been wrongfully escalated to an art form.  Music that feeds your soul in a no-frills environment that won't bastardize the experience.  Out of the way for most tourists, if they're any there, they love the blues.  That's what it's all about... so good you can almost taste it..,.

"A great local bar with live music. Great place to hear rock and jazz. Off strip so it's easy for locals to avoid the strip traffic. The location on Spring Mountain, just west of I-15 also makes it easy for LV visitors to get a local vibe (and cheap beerdrinks).  About a 5 minute ride from center strip.

High up in the sky the little stars climb, always reminding me that we're apart...""As we entered Le Tigre for a night cap, ""Stardust"" played on the old jukebox and I was overwhelmed by orange and the comforting smell of popcorn. My fiance and I ordered two rum collins cocktails to celebrate our ""pre-anniversary"". He's been frequenting Le Tigre and telling me all about it for a few months before I moved here--although he likes to pronounce it ""lay tigray"", I'll forgive him. It's probably not the local style to pronounce it all frenchy-like anyway.

"Le Tigre is a hidden gem. I found out about it through a friend who pointed it out to me when I first arrived in town. He told me David Lynch famously said this is the ""best bar in Madison."" What's most awesome about Le Tigre are the bartenders. The owner has owned three iterations of the bar since the 50s, and his son bartends most of the time. His son is one of the nicest, most genial, and quickest bartenders you'll find in town. The bar attracts many locals and regulars who come in just to talk with him. This is another place you can feel safe coming to if you feel like having a drink on your own (and as a woman, it can be difficult to find such places).I don't want to ruin the suprise of Le Tigre's decor too much, but if you are a lover of kitsch, you'll love Le Tigre. The bar also has a jukebox filled with songs that have been in it since the owner opened the bar in another location in the 50s. Some notes: you can't swear in the bar. If you have a potty mouth and need to exercise it, go to another bar. Le Tigre also is cash-only, and there is no ATM, because the owner doesn't feel safe having one, so if you forget cash, you've got a bit of a haul to an ATM. Also, don't expect draught beers; you can only get beer in bottles here, though there is also a full bar.This is a local's bar, an oddity, a place you go to for a kick. It is not a  bar that caters to the jet set.

"I feel like saying that this bar is a reported favorite of David Lynch should be review enough, but I'll try to gussy it up with usefulness or some such thing.  The odd location in a strip mall with an unassuming storefront seems just right for some reason.  As do the numerous tigers, tiger prints, and tiger carpet which lend themselves to the name.  The bartender was friendly, the atmosphere cozy, and the music classic.  Drinks were good and cheap.  A decently sized (and poured) Tanqueray and tonic and a Spotted Cow will set you back $8.  Other than the free flowing popcorn there's no food, no credit cards, and allegedly no swearing, though I did manage to catch myself saying ""ass"" and I didn't even notice I'd said ""bitchass bitch"" and nobody tossed me out on my can.  That doesn't mean you won't be given the bum's rush for your potty mouth.  I'll try to do better next time.  No Log Lady to be found anywhere.

"Fun fact: all of the tiger decor is DONATED! My husband and I have been wanting to go here for a long time, mostly because of the camp factor. It seemed really cheesy and fun. Turns out, it is AMAZING. Here is the low-down of why I love this place. Atmosphere - Outside of the very obvious and corny tiger decor, this is the kind of place you could come to in a cocktail dress or jeans and a t-shirt and fit in (I know because we saw that exact combination while we were there). If you stay for more than a few drinks, you might forget where you are or what time of day it is because it is quite dark inside. Other than than, it is a standard townie bar dressed to the nines, complete with obligatory free, stale popcorn. There is ample parking, but you might not want to drive (see Drinks)Drinks - I got a Tom Collins. My husband got a Manhattan. These are the types of drinks you should order at this place. They make a fabulous, no frills, strong mixed drink. As it should be. This is Wisconsin, after all.Staff - I've only ever been there when a younger man was bartending, but he was fabulous. He was chatty and friendly without being annoying. And he had a sense of humor about his white shirt and bow tie. Take home - Le Tigre is not only special because of it's camp and decor. It is fabulous because they put some crimson lipsick on tired, old hole in the wall and made her look like Scarlet Johansson.

"You. must. go. to. Le Tigre.  I just love it. I do wish they had tap beer and a better selection in  bottles, but everything else about it is fantastic.  This is the most loungy lounge I've seen in...maybe ever - I don't imagine they've changed anything since the day they opened in like the sixties - including the music in the juke box - 7 plays for $1.00.

"This place is for people who get it. If you don't get it, you definitely won't get it.

"I do not even know where to begin.  This might be the greatest bar I have ever been too, and I have been to couple.  Our Madison friends wanted to take us here after our early show at Indie Coffee.  They enticed us by saying it's a TIGER themed bar in Madison's oldest strip mall and it's David Lynch's fave bar!  SO we said lets do it!  When we arrived we were the only patrons in the place.. It was pretty dark inside, but not dark enough to hide all the amazing TIGER photos, paintings, furniture, and Real Taxidermfied Tigers!  The bartenderowner was amazing, he looked like AL from HAPPY DAYS!Just like this... http:the701level.files.wordpress.com2010126a0105349ca980970c011571508c8b970b-320wi.jpg so you can Imagine my excitement. He was super nice and just looked like something out of a gangster movie!  You know like the guy who knows everything! The drinks were cheap, so you could get a round for 5 people under 20 bucks!  Which is amazing and YEP you guessed it I was drinking TIGER beers!The jukebox was out of this world, 7 plays for a dollar and all the records were old and scratchy.  Which gave the place a really wonderful vibe. Songs by Louis Armstrong, Elvis, Frank Sinatra, and Tina Turner were the soundtrack to our amazing and very memorable night!So the next time someone wants to take you to a Bar in a Strip Mall you better hope it's Tiger themed and in Madison!

"The best little hidden gem in the city. They have a classic jukebox, bartenders that mix excellent drinks, and tigers everywhere. I love this place so much. Just don't swear...

"Downtown Scottsdale is one of the few areas in the Phoenix area that lends itself well to walking. And every Thursday evening from 7-9 pm for the past 30 years (except on Thanksgivings), that's exactly what art-lovers in Scottsdale have been doing. Walking. The over 100 art galleries along Main St., Marshall Way, and throughout Old Town participate, many with artist receptions, hosing one giant, informal open house. Several times during the year, look for special themed Art Walks with live music and entertainment.The perfect way to get out and see Scottsdale!
",1
"Whether it is Art Walk or just any day I love shopping or looking at the galleries in Downtown Scottsdale. I cannot yet say I have even been to most of them because there are so many! All of the galleries I have been to have been really cool with amazing one of a kind pieces. All of the owners have been very nice to me which is cool. I guess I have this stereotype that all people who work in galleries will see I'm young and can't afford anything and will be snooty to me. Not the case though! Great way to kill a day, and really fun to do the art walk at night which has a great energy!Ollie the Trolley=Free!

"once per 'season' (yes I know phoenix doesn't have seasons, just hot and less hot, yet i love it) they have a super art walk.  There are street performers, free food, radio stations.  Most galleries have wine to sample.  Makes for a good time. Not to mention some amazing artwork.  I have been known to window shop on a somewhat crooked walk home from the bars, its even better when you get to go in!

"Kind of like a warm, outdoor version of the National Gallery in DC.  I would even be willing to say you'll see more interesting collections than what is housed at our DC gallery.There's plenty of Southwestern scenes of Native Americans and the Grand Canyon, but I did manage to admire 2 pricey Picassos, and multiple paintings of faraway landscapes.  The galleries on Main St are amazing and have an ecletic collection.
",1
"A must do on Thursday evening if you're a tourist. Tons of art galleries feature lots of Native American culture, sculptures, jewelry and some of the galleries have wine! Expensive- but a great way to appreciate art. If you're staying at a local hotel, find a golf cart driver. They work off tips!

"For my girlfriend's birthday I took her to Mary Elaine's, which is a super fancy French restaraunt in Scottsdale, AZ. My brother has worked there for a few years now, and he's been suggesting that we experience it. The staff was extremely attentive and pleasant, addressing us by name and taking a moment to replace my girlfriend's blue napkin with a black one to match her dress. They even brought over a small stool for me to set my digital camera on. The restaraunt is situated on the top floor of the Phoenician Resort and every seat at Mary Elaine's has a spectacular view of the valley.We let the chef prepare a tasting menu for us, and their Sommelier (wine expert) paired wines with many of the tastings. I will have to consult with my brother to fully explain the dishes served, but the food was so fine tuned to perfection that I can not imagine improvement. I HIGHLY recommend EVERYONE eat at Mary Elaine's at least once, as it is truly the finest experience in dining I can imagine.I posted images of our food here.  http:www.secret.strandland.comMaryElaines
",1
"[I can't believe that I am the second person to review this restaurant. I may be the last; Mary Elaine's closes its doors for good sometime this month (Feb 2008). Perhaps I am the second person because a proper dinner for two (and I mean that that includes a _real_ selection from the best wine list in the city) will cost you $700 to $800, easily the cost of a coach ticket to Paris for the real thing. But make your reservations in advance. Dinner at Guy Savoy must be planned 4 to 6 weeks ahead. In case you don't realize it by the time you finish this one, I _AM_ a food snob.I feel a very heavy burden here because Mary Elaine's has stood for everything I have hoped for in the finest of service and detailed preparation in a dining experience since I was a member of the Plaza Club, also now defunct. That I could presume to review this establishment and the professionals who take each and every part of their job as their personal quest in life is totally ludicrous. Instead of a review, I can at best present some of my fondest memories of this wonderful place. OK, Now that I have set the bar high enough for myself, let me begin.]I can't remember if the team that comprises the army of staff that will serve you at front of house numbers 12 or 21 people, but by the time your dinner is over, you will have had a dinner to remember for the rest of your life.Take your pick from one of two seatings, 6 to 6:45 or 8:30 to 9:15. Give the reservationist every last detail of your preferences. Some of my favorite requests: (1) seat me as far away from that wailing wanna-be Lisa Addeo who thinks she can replace Nancy Gee -- she's still singing the exact same songs in the exact same order she was eight years ago in the lobby. If I have to hear her make those Time-to-Say-Goodbye octave leaps one more effing time, I'm going to kill myself; (2) give us relaxed timing on the courses, we're in no rush; (3) my guest does not drink alcohol and is from Iran, find a formal drink for her that she will appreciate; (4) my guest loves Chateaubriand, could you scrape some upAmong my most memorable experiences:The time Todd (manager) knowing my love of late 80's California cabs found a bottle of '88 Heitz Martha's Vineyard and surprised me for my birthday dinner.The time my guest surprised me by calling in and requested hot sourdough for my bread choice knowing how much I love it.The time our party sat at Chef's table in the kitchen and I watched first hand the quietest kitchen you can possibly imagine.The bottle of '62 Chateau Gran Larose that left my mouth black and from which I was still drunk the next day.My one and only ever sliver of Louis XIV cognac at $750 a slice.The way Nancy Gee used to sing Angel Eyes, my favorite.The time Sommelier Paul introduced me to the rasiney sweet pleasure of Lusteau Emilin cherry.Mary Elaine's took pride in finding the most extravagant yet excellent ingredients in the entire world. It would not be uncommon for the special to include some extremely rare fish that had been flown in that afternoon. The wine list boasted 5000 bottles. Where else could you splurge on a $10,000 bottle of champagne (The answer is Etienne's Different Point of View at Pointe Tapatillo Cliffs.) What if you feel like having a '60's bottle of Lafite Rothschild Paul and his staff were always happy to oblige.I'm talking about the subtleties of food preparation such that a single course may have but six or seven bites, but each of those is a symphony of tastes that overwhelms the senses. On my last visit, the sauce chefs had perfected their entries to each course to such an extent that their excellence sometimes overshadowed the main ingredients themselves.It was fun to gulp my entire glass of water to see how many seconds it would take to be noticed and refilled (no more than 15).Mary Elaine's celebrated what might be called a sacred relationship between a host and his guest. You will be missed.

"We've been going to Mary Elaine's since it made its debut years ago, and it has never let us down. When it closes its doors April 5th, it will be the end of an era. I agree with Mike's comments and remember well the Plaza Club, but Mary Elaine's has always been in a league of its own.Greg, the Master Sommelier, became a friend through the years and never failed to introduce us to exquisite wines that he would often set aside for us, or give us a call when something special arrived so we'd be sure to make a reservation.The Chef's Table, Todd, Greg, Nancy Gee -- we still miss her and we'll continue to miss them all.  The last I knew years ago when Todd departed, he was going to launch a restaurant somewhere on Central. Does anybody know if he's still in town and was his then-new venture successful. I was surprised and a bit disappointed that Mary Elaine's is closing with a whimper. I thought perhaps one final blow-out on April 5th would have been a wonderful way to bid an appropriate farewell to a grand lady.Formal, elegant dining is clearly on the wane, and while there are many excellent restaurants in the greater Phoenix-Scottsdale area, Mary Elaine's will always stand alone. It will be missed.

"Mary Elaine's was like nothing my boyfriend and I had ever done. It's not really our style, but we had a great time, nonetheless. The service was, of course, very good. I thought it would be too stuffy for our tastes and that I'd feel out of place, but this did not happen. As a matter of fact, after our server warmed up to us, we had a great back-and-forth... same goes for our backserver, who we came to call the Bread-Pusher, because the bread is incredibly addicting.I had the tasting menu, and other than the rabbit, it was awesome. I didn't like the rabbit not because of how it was prepared though, I just don't like rabbit. Too cute and fuzzy.Our server brought us some great wine pairings that were not on the menu and included what we dubbed the ""adult"" framboise... so delicious. It was a cherry sparkling wine  and tasted amazing with chocolate.The whole night was opulence perfected. I will probably never eat here again (oh, except for that whole gift certificate thing) especially because it's closing, but it was fantastic and really a wonderful place to take someone if you need to either impress them or if you're apologizing for something you really, really screwed up.

"Uber-fancy French restaurant in Scottdale! 55 Thanks to AJ and J, we got a chance to dine and wine there last year! It is a super nice french restaurant in Phoenician Resort. My first fancy french dining experience! :) All four of us had the tasting menu that evening with great Ridge wine. The tasting mene has small portion but amazing food. As expected, it took us ~4 hours to get done with the dinner. It was the only drawback J could come up with... I think that was perfectly fine for me since we are dining in a FRENCH restaurant. Just enjoy the process! I would definitely go there again.

"Ever wander around, trying to find the perfect place to have dinner, overwhelmed with options and unsure how to pick Well, we trekked to Old Montreal and perused probably ten menus of all different restaurants to inform our dinner location decision. By the time we found Jardin Nelson we were hungry and getting punchy. I looked to the back and saw the outdoor patio and large canvas coverings and said ""oooohh, let's go here!"" We were led to a quaint table at the back, a jazz band playing lovely music. The greenery and flowers hang all over the place and the whole atmosphere is warm and inviting. Our server was super nice, friendly, and courteous.I got the leek soup special. It was creamy, savory, a perfect soup. I got the veggie crepe for dinner and gobbled every bit. It was so delicious. For dessert we had the cheesecake crepe and it was heaven. You have to get this thing. Topped with graham crackers and strawberries, totally decadent.Exquisite dining experience from top to bottom. Would return anytime and recommend to anyone.

"My husband and I were big fans of this place, not only for the great food, service, and jazz but for the experience as a whole. We sat outside in the garden (after a 10 minute wait for a  late dinner on a Friday night) and marveled at the design of the place. The giant, umbrella-like contraptions probably allow for outdoor seating when it rains and made you feel like you were sitting under giant flowers. The south wall and the foliage definitely made us feel like we were in a garden. The sounds of a jazz quartet wafting through a fresh summer night definitely capped a most romantic evening.Now the food: we started with the Estivale salad (intricately prepared mixing refreshing fruit and vegetables together in perfect balance - one of the best salads we've ever had) and for our main course, had the charcutiere pizza and the saddle of rabbit crepe. The pizza was amazing - thin crust with the tastiest meats on there! The crepe was also very tasty but difficult to isolate all ingredients within (no big deal).For dessert, we shared the pouding chomeur and omg was it incredible. It was very sweet (because of the high quality pure maple syrup) and the vanilla ice cream balanced that perfectly.One of the things I really liked seeing was that on the comment card, there was a question for rating pricequality ratio. Indeed, this place had an excellent pricequality ratio! They could easily charge more, for the setting, for the jazz, for the food but they don't. Very respectable!For a perfect romantic summer evening, this is it! Highly recommended. We would totally go back.

"To be honest, we stumbled across this place almost by accident, and to top it off, we almost missed the best part about the restaurant!  There is a patio situated right onto Place Jacques Cartier, however there is an open section behind the restaurant, where a jazz quartet was playing.  The food was really good.  My wife had a crepe, my sister also had a crepe (not the same kind of course), while I enjoyed an ""Italian"" pizza, which I know as a Margarita pizza.  We absolutely loved the atmosphere and sitting outside on a hot and humid Montreal evening, drinking wine, listening to live jazz  and eating great French food made this a real highlight of our trip.

"Jardin Nelson is fantastic for several reasons, the first of which is that it's one of the cheaper joints in vieux-Montreal.It was hot on the sun-baked cobblestone main path and I was aching to sit and enjoy a french style brunch and JN delivered beautifully. We sat in the back garden, and we were instantly cooled by the shade and breeze the architecture of the inner eaterie. It's beautiful, with lots of garden plants and stone walls, well lit and your meal is accompanied by jazz music (sometimes live as when I went!).The waitresses are cute and friendly, and can obv accommodate if you only speak english. The menu is somewhat sparse, but what's on there is made with a delicate and professional touch; all of our food was top notch and delicious. I had the house crepe, a friend had the rabbit and another the scallopene. We relaxed and enjoyed the meal and the scenery and heartily recommend the jardin Nelson to both tourists and locals alike. Prices are btwn $15-25person.

"Very pretty place. You're kind of outdoors but with a tent like ceiling with jazz playing. I had a crepe...which was plain...I thought they were known for their crepes but all crepes looked plain. I should have gotten what my friend had...the egg dish...which looked like it was in a casserole...MMmmmI was eying some guy who got a HUGE French onion soup. It looked like twice the normal size. Should have gotten one. Get that French Onion Soup!!!

"One of the most unique dining experiences I've ever had. It's a building constructed around a courtyard, with wind sail overhangs that protect you from the elements inside. So basically, your entirely outside, and if it's raining it's quite the show. Rain funnels down the sails into large glass columns. Hard to explain, but VERY cool. Food was above average, but set amidst all of the tourist attraction area, it's more than what you'd expect. When I'm back in Montreal, I'm going back!

"Our visit to this wonderland of cheese was quite possibly the highlight of my friends' and my recent visit to Montreal. Even if the food had been terrible, the scenic brick courtyard with its lush, flowering planters, live jazz band, and oversized umbrellas would've made the dining experience memorable. But luckily, the dinner was great too!We tried the brie, pesto, and pine nut fondue as an appetizer, which was served with toasted baguette slices and a bunch of grapes, and which met with enthusiastic reviews from our cheese-loving crowd. A smorgasbord of the signature crepe dinners followed - we sampled the mushroom-filled Forestiere, the vegetable and goat cheese, the apple-bacon, and the duck. At about $15-$20 a plate, we didn't find the cost incongruous with the food quality. For dessert, we sampled the ""pudding chomeur,"" a Quebec favorite that features some sort of spongey, sweet base soaked in maple syrup and served with a side of vanilla ice cream - also delicious, though we were too stuffed to finish the modest portion, even between the four of us!The service was equally pleasant; we arrived around 9:30pm on a Saturday night and were seated within ten minutes. Our dry-witted French waiter was a delight, suggesting that a hungry member of our party ""start with one crepe, and then if you're really still hungry I may bring you another,"" and later threatened to deny me dessert for not finishing my main course. English menus are printed on the reverse of the French, for visiting anglophones. Overall - great decor, food, ambiance, and service. We'll be returning if we're ever in Old Town Montreal again!

"I adore the Jardin Nelson. Not only is the location stunning, being surrounded by historical buildings just off Place Jacques Cartier in Old Montreal, but the atmosphere in this indooroutdoor restaurant can't be beat.The largest part of the restaurant and most well known is their big terasse (can you call it that when it's more than 34 of the restaurant) with huge parasols in case it rains. Sit under the sun or the stars while eating perfectly cooked meal or dessert crepes, while sipping on a glass of fine wine.Jardin Nelson is perfect for a romantic night out, especially when the jazz band is playing!

"I went to Jardin Nelson on a Friday at lunch.  There can be a bit of line, but the wait wasn't too bad.This place is worth the visit for the ambiance alone! A beautiful courtyard patio with canopies and, trees and flowers and a jazz combo played in the not so background.We shared the nachos ($15) for starters and they were very yummy and cheesy.  My father kept commenting on the cranberry salsa.  My mother started with the French Onion Soup and said it was the best she had ever had. I had the UnBeetable salad and found it filling and delicious. I also ordered a 16 oz pitcher of White Sangria.  It was GREAT!  So yummy on a warm afternoon and great to share with a friend.My 3-year-old was nicely welcomed and given crayons and a paper.  She had the pancakes (other choices for kids were limited to pasta or pizza). A place I will return to.

"Stunning decor, live jazz music, and delicious brunch fare. This is absolutely one of my favourite brunch spots.This restaurant is the perfect marriage between outdoor and indoor dining. The decor is simply stunning - the unusual giant umbrellas, the potted plants and flowers, and the exposed brick create a whimsical and romantic environment.To eat I had the bacon breakfast crepe. It was heavenly! The crepe batter is much thicker than the expected paper-thin variety, but it definitely works. It's still light and soft, and the hint of sweetness works so well with the salty bacon and savoury cheese and eggs. Just writing this review makes my stomach growl.If you're looking for a great brunch spot in Old Montreal definitely check this place out!

"All that jazz!Other places do jazz once in a while. But these folks do it all year 'round. Aw yea. Great venue and friendly bar staff.

"I loved this intimate place. It is small and UPSTAIRS writes upside down because it is actually in a basement! :-) Very stylish and great jazz., not the kind so out of tune & u can't bear. Drinks are delicious here too and cheap! I had the entertainer - a recommandation from a handsome waiter, very well made for only $7.5! My friend had something colada which is also very tasty.

"Upstairs is Montreal's finest jazz venue and one of the city's local gems. Its a small and intimate, a perfect spot for any date and a fun way to spend an evening sipping on drinks, grabbing a bite, and listening to some of the best live music in the area.  Joel Giberovitch opened this neat little jazz joint nearly 20 years ago, which has gained a notable amount of popularity, especially in the last decade. His inspirations from his past  trips to legendary New York jazz are an obvious influence in the makeup of his decor, which include wooden panels, brick walls, a lengthy yet cozy bar, and classy linens draping each table. If that doesn't establish the mood, I don't know what does. Seating is tight of course, but group dining is very possible here; I would highly recommend reservations.Though it's been touted as a fun lunch spot, I'm more of a fan during their showcase nights which happen every Friday and Saturday. There is usually a cover charge before midnight, which was about $5 last time I checked. Groups of 4 or more are almost guaranteed a wait, but if you don't listen to jazz often, then take it like a champ and wait it out.If the music isn't worth it (but of course it is), then consider the food and the drinks. Much of the menu is distinctly American, with quite few dishes named after notable states in the South, the birth place of jazz. Another portion of the menu is tapas, which is more bar food (nachos, quesadillas, fries, etc.) than they are classic Spanish small plates. I've enjoyed their food overall, as I've had good results with their pappardelle verona, their New Orleans filet mignon, and their array of tasty burgers. Try any of their martinis or get a wine to be paired with the food.Then of course there's the music. Live jazz doesn't have to be during Montreal Jazz Festival, it can be had here on a much more casual level. The music has always taken precedence and has been a treat every time. I could probably not even eat anything and just sit to enjoy the performances, which vary from a wide range of local and visiting musicians.I think very highly of this place and hope it continues to do well. I haven't gone to Montreal as often lately and want Upstairs to keep the drinks flowing and the music going. If only I could write their name upside down (see pics for reference).

"Visited many years ago and enjoyed it. I am glad to see they are still there.

"Went here years ago and couldn't believe this was in my own city.Sitting down, having a drink, listening to talent. I felt like a tourist and loved it. Also, the fries and garlic mayo is awesome! For a late night snack.So, for a romantic jazzy date night visit upstairs, which is actually downstairs!

"Fabulous place.They have a packed calendar full of local jazz bands, and plenty of them are the real deal. Doesn't matter what your age is or how you feel about jazz music, you will enjoy the evening's performance because they're always top-notch.The room does tend to get very stuffy and warm, though, so allow yourself some time to get used to the difference in temperature inside (especially nowadays when the thermometer's beginning to dip). I can't complain about the food: Lots of tasty tapas (the Ceviche, Prosciutto, and Gambas are must-tries), a great Scotch selection, and of course, local beers. If you get there while an act has already started their set, sit outside if it's not too cold. You still get to enjoy the music and the food without having to pay for the cover (or suffering the heat).

"This place is listed in several places as one of the best jazz clubs in Canada, and specifically in Montreal.  Since Montreal has possibly one of the best jazz scenes in the world, that's high praise.  I can see why.While the music may not always be jazz, the club is a great venue.  Its small and intimate, with good acoustics.  Make sure you check the calendar, as the bands can be eclectic.  And you may want to make reservations.  Finally, expect a cover charge ($11 and well worth it).The doorman was great.  There wasn't any more room for a show and, instead of simply telling us to beat feet as many would, he recommended a later show and reservations in the future.  We came back for the later show and he seated us at the side bar.  After the set, he seated us (party of two) in a booth for the late set.  While the house wasn't full for the late show, it was still greatly appreciated.Great staff, great venue, great music.  I can't recommend it enough.

"Discovered this place recently. The ambiance is nice and cozy, the live jazz band was really good! And the service was superb!!!!

"I'm really not sure why the other people who wrote reviews are such haters. I have to admit that I'm not the kind of dude who ever thought that I would start coming to a place such as la pomponee to get an ""overpriced"" haircut. Let's put it this way, I'm a cheap bastard when it comes to haircuts but I can guarantee that you will never find me in a Supercuts again! My entire experience blows every haircut I have ever had out of the water. I love the fact that I showed up after scheduling an appointment the previous day and there was no waiting around. The stylist name I regret can't remember from two days ago but I told her straight up, ""I'm giving you full latitude to do what you think is right for me."" I was not disappointed with how nice of a job she did. She asked the right questions and I could hold a good conversation with her. To top off the experience I was offered a complimentary bottle of Heineken, that isn't happening at Supercuts, and it only cost about an extra $10. I would highly recommend this place for all men's haircuts.

"I love La Pomponnee! This is the only place I go to get my eye brows waxed and I will only get them done by Bonnie, she is awesome! I have also gotten a few facials and 1 couples massage here. Everyone I have encountered is always nice and helpful.

"I've been looking for a fun stylist in Pittsburgh that ""gets"" my curly hair -- and doesn't charge a fortune -- for years. After my first appointment today, I'm ending my search!Aaron P. did a fantastic job on my cut and balanced out my texture and volume. The rest of the staff was friendly and the space with bright and upbeat. To second an earlier comment, they didn't offer me a tour or brochure of their services as a first-time guest -- but I didn't mind asking for them.I'll their other services and will report back. But for now, I highly recommend La Pomponnee!

"Great spa!! Had a blueberry facial - felt instantly hydrated which I really needed. They have a ton of options and really helpful, knowledgeable staff. It's worth the investment!!

"All I have to say is that I've sold my soul to the follicle Gods at Modern!  I've been struggling for the last couple of years to find my salon ""home"" and after my last two appointments with CJ Clark at Modern in Birkdale, I'm finally home!  I went in (scared to death) for a style-changing cut.  I started with long hair (half-way down my back) and emerged with a sassy new shoulder-length bob!  Modern often gets bad press because of their rather expensive prices but service like this is worth every penny!  The only downside to this salon is that they only accept gratuity via cash or check.  For other debit card addicts out there, you'll have to suck it up and go to an ATM before your visit.

"David Parks is an amazing massage therapist!!!I was visiting from out of town and needed a massage.  I was staying at a hotel nearby and knew Modern Salon from when I lived in the area before.  I called up and they got me in right away.  I walked in, filled out the paperwork and in walks my massage therapist.  He brought me into the room and gave me my instructions and left.  I shed my clothes and slipped under the covers of the warmed massage table. David knocked and came in and began what I now refer to as one of the best massages I have ever had in my life.  He used hot damp towels on my back, hands and feet.  It is incredibly difficult for me to ""turn my brain off"" - even during a massage.  I actually fell asleep.   Ahhh, what stress

"One of the best salons ever. They take hair and skin very seriously. Toni T. for haircuts, Jennifer Martinez for color, Sodi for threading, and Candace, or Debbie Nelms for waxing. Must see Tiffany for a massage. This little woman has great hands!

"So my history of haircare is not a simple one.  There have been many attempts by many haircare professionals to try to tame my mane and keep my 'do' in check. A lot of 'accidental crew cut' incidents and uneven 'laughed at by everyone including my Mom' moments.  Many have failed , few have been passable.  Lana from Hearst Tower Modern has been the only one with a combination of skill and patience to really understand the method to the madness that is my ""chia pet""-esque head.    I have now been visiting her for over a year and she has made me look better each subsequent time.  Consistency, talent, great customer service.... hard to realistically put a price tag on that level of value (plus free neck trims between each haircut).  I can proudly say - People of Charlotte with hair that can grow out straight for 5 inches before falling flat, REJOICE.   There is an alternative to shaving it all off or applying half a bottle of 'LA Looks'!  Just because your head is lopsided does not mean you can't look sexay! One other thing, FUCK GREATCLIPS.  That is all.

"If you work uptown, this is a great location for you!  I get my hair and eyebrows done here and have also have had several massages.  The staff is really sweet - they always remember what wine I like!  There is enough staff to fit your needs and price ranges.  They do reminder calls which I LOVE cause I make my appts months in advance.There is a central desk that triages all Modern calls so if you are running late it is kind of annoying because you cant just call the location you are going to.  But the desk will let them know right away so it has always worked out....it is just odd that it is hard to get ahold of the your specific location.  Love you Modern!  I always leave feeling pampered and fabulous!  :-D

"I was in town for a wedding this past weekend. I forgot to pack my heavy duty equipment to style my hair, and when I say heavy duty equipment I really mean it. My hair is long, thick, and curly. So I found Modern Salon just a few blocks away from my hotel. When I first got there the lady that took care of me was very polite even after she realized that blow-drying my hair would take a lifetime. She scurried of to speak to her supervisor or maybe a more experienced stylist for suggestions on what products or brushes to use. Nikki came along and was extremely knowledgeable with my textured type of hair; she had an amazing attitude not only to satisfy the customer but also towards the not so experienced stylist, they are lucky to have her as a mentor. I don't usually write reviews but after the experience I had at that salon I think it's worth writing a review to mention the professionalism and the positive attitude of the salon. I did mention to Nikki this is probably the first time I've ever had anyone ""understand"" my hair. She didn't take forever to blow dry my hair because she knew what she was doing. I wish I could have taken her back home to DC, but she suggested a really good stylist in this area. :)

"Don't let the 80s logo scare you off. I had a really great haircut here for really cheap - just $35! I made an appointment without asking about pricing because I was in desperate need of a haircut. The stylist spent a long time talking to me about what I wanted, how I style my hair, how much time I spend and what products I use. As she was cutting my hair, she gave me lots of tips on styling. In the end, I came out with one of the best haircuts I ever had.Add in the wine, excellent head massage, and makeup touch-up she gave me at the end and it was a 5-star experience.BTW it's an Aveda salon in case you are wondering.

"I recently moved to Charlotte and have been looking for a good Aveda salon. I googled locations near my office and found Modern Salon. I was able to get an appointment the day of with a junior stylist. I saw Laura and she gave me an amazing hair cut for $36 (excluding tip). I have to admit, I was nervous to see a junior stylist but I can honestly say she gave me one of the best hair cuts I've had in a long time. I definitely recommend her!
",1
"I'm hooked. I made a last minute appointment to get all over color and a partial highlight in an attempt to fix a seriously botched coloring.  I showed a picture and explained what I wanted and Laura and Val worked their magic. My hair look amazing and it came out way better than I ever expected.  Also, they did it so that I don't have to touch anything up for 7-8 weeks.  The staff is great and they are very attentive and accomodating.  It can get pricey but it is worth every penny. :)

"This place is awesome and Gabby did a great job giving me the best haircut of my life!  Pay the extra few bucks to go here rather than get a sub par cut someplace else! Well worth it!

"My first time visiting Palestra. I had an appointment with Sharon. I was looking for a place that specified with skin care. I didn't want to go somewhere and spend a hundred dollars on someone rubbing and massaging products into my face for a hour. I wanted to come out with some results to my skin problems. Sharon did everything I wanted in a facial PLUS more! Their business is skin and it started out with Sharon's mother Hannah and now Sharon is in the business. Its a nice quaint place. Not as grand and opulent as the franchise spas but nice and cozy. Sharon explained a lot of things to me so I could understand what she was doing while she was doing it but not too talkative where I was unable to relax. She started out with explaining her background and than moving onto my skin needs and what she recommends for my facial. She took her time doing everything. SHe was so thorough with her massages and extractions, I LOVED it! What I didn't expect and have never received anywhere else was a foot massage while my face was getting a peel and steam bath! I usually get a hand or shoulder massage but never a foot massage. She massaged each foot and put them into little warm booties. I was in my little own world while she was working on my face. I did not feel rushed I felt like she had all the time in the world to work on my face pore by pore! I loved it and recommend it to anyone who needs skin care!

"I have been going to Palestra to see Sharon for a long time. The spa is extremely relaxing and welcoming. Sharon always does a excellent job. I always look forward to my next appointment. I  look and feel wonderful every time I leave. They are the best.

"Finding an esthetician that is good at both facials and full body massages is difficult.  If you want a great experience at a great value, book an appointment with Melanie.  I've had many massages and facials in my life  time and I would have to say she's my favorite!  Very in tuned with the body, mind and soul.  She worked on muscles I didn't know I had, and my face looks so much healthier after seeing her.
",1
"Love this place, it is amazing, the prices are pretty good and I only let Melanie touch my face. She is very educated and makes you feel very comfortable. I normalyy get the express mini and I have gone there so many times they know me when I call. I feel very comfortable here. The atmosphere makes you feel very comforable and relaxed and the facials are amazing!
",1
"I usually prefer body wraps to massages, but Melanie made me forget wraps even exist! She gave me such a wonderful hot stone massage and was extremely considerate of my preferences throughout - staying warm, making the experience relaxing while still relieving tension, and creating a calm, peaceful environment. She wasn't the least bit pushy and I left feeling more relaxed than I have in years. All around, it's everything I want in a day at the spa and I can't wait to go back!

"I heart Modern Salon.An amazing value - got a great haircut and a relaxing (didn't realize that was possible) eyebrow wax here yesterday... only $65!  Lesley gave me the exact haircut I was looking for, all while fixing the goofy layers I was growing out from my last busted haircut.   The service was fantastic... as long as I am in Charlotte, this is the only place I will go.  Tip - they do not let you put tip on the credit card, so make sure you have cash with you!

"I really like Modern Salon.  My 1st time going I had made an apt. with Myra for a cut and color.  I didn't know anything about her and I was nervous because my hair is kind of my ""thing.""  And if you get a bad haircut, you have to wait to make it better.Well turns out Myra was great, a really sweet girl and she knows what she is doing.  That first time there I was coloring my hair dark brown and I discussed with her what would I have to do to get back to my natural dirty blonde color when I got sick of being a brunette.  She explained what we would need to do and a little over a year later we started on the process to bring it back to blonde.  It was definitely cheaper to just get cut and color then the highlights and cut, but she does such a good job and I always get a lot of compliments.  And I can let it go for longer in between touch ups.  Also of note, my first time here the receptionist didn't let Myra know I had checked in and so there was a bit of a misunderstanding and I was left to sit for a while.  I approached the desk again after waiting 20 minutes and told them I had a flight to catch in 3 hours, would we be able to start soon, if not I had to leave.Well Myra was so apologetic and she felt awful that they kept me waiting.  I did get out of there a bit later than I would have liked, and I did find myself running to get into the airport, but I did make my flight.  But the best thing was, I got a gift certificate in the mail soon after for either a free massage, pedicure or facial with any other service I had.  I thought that was a really nice touch and I used it for a pedicure after a haircut on another visit.

"Very nice place, Mohsen knows how to cut my hair - which not an easy job. Comparable to the high end places my wife and would go to in LA and Santa Barbara. Great to have this level of skill in Charlotte.

"If you have hair, get your booty to Modern. One of the worst things about moving is having to find a new stylist. Before I moved to Charlotte, I had my stylist do an all-over color to bring me back to my original hair color and wipe out my years of highlights so I didn't have to find someone right away after moving for upkeep. After a year and a half, I finally decided to brave the daunting task of finding a new salon so I could be back to my blonde alter ego. Girls in my office had been recommending Modern for months, but I decided to take my chances elsewhere. Bad choice. After 3 sub-par highlights, I looked like a tiger (in a bad, orange and streaky kind of way) and gave in to their insistence that I try Modern. Man, do I feel silly that I wasted so much time and money at other salons! Sandy, a stylist at Modern, was not only one of the nicest people I've ever met, but she did an outstanding job on my hair. She understood exactly what I relayed to her and went above and beyond in doing a deep conditioning treatment and explaining what we could do next time to make my hair look even better. Sandy is a true professional and really listened to what I was saying about how my hair reacts to different things and they way I like it to look (unlike the other places I had gone, hence the tiger-head.) After a wonderful head massage during the deep conditioning treatment and a fantastic blow-out, i was on my way to face the world looking 100% better than when I walked in. I would recommend Sandy's services to anyone who wants to look fabulous.

"I've been getting my haircut here once a month for the past 10 months. I'm very happy. Prior to coming here I went to salon Cielo in the mall and occasionally would go to barbershops depending on what style I was going for. I love the atmosphere in there and the staff is super friendly. Megan is the stylist that I regularly go to. I definitely recommend her for haircuts, she's great. I thought that I'd have a hard time finding a great stylist and a great place to get haircuts, but that's just not the case. A+

"I started going to Modern in June when I moved to Charlotte from the DC area.  My family owns an amazing salon in the DC area so I have very high standards when receiving any salon services.  I've also never gone anywhere else for a haircut so I was a little nervous going somewhere new.When I called to make my first appt, the receptionist was very nice.  She asked about  my budget and what I was looking for.  She also explained their different levels of stylists that I had to choose from.The salon is clean, bright, and smells great (thanks to Aveda products)!  My stylist, Siobhan, is so nice and always does an amazing job!  The front desk staff have always been nice as well.

"I came here following a student. On trial basis. It's kind a small place but very calming....havnt figured out why yet.  You feel spoiled here.

"I admit, I have very high expectations when it comes to service and this place was AMAZING. The stylist definitely took the time to listen to my concerns regarding my hair, gave me a oil head massage before shampooing my hair, a hand massage while my hair was conditioning and an amazing cut all for the low price of $33! I already have plans to make it back. Thank you for being so wonderful!

"MCV is an Este Lauder salon. Actually it is an Aveda salon (same thing).  I love Aveda! It's like a cult that I am in. Aveda only.There's only 3 beauty products I let touch my skin and hair. Este Lauder moisturizer, MAC studio finish concealer, and Aveda shampoo and conditioner. Get the point I think I should be in charge of the Este Lauder portfolio or a brand ambassador or something. So enough about the Aveda products, the stylists at MCV really do wonders. Since moving to WI, I made myself home at MCV and have a regular hairdresser who makes my life easier and less stressful. Every four weeks for a trim. The convenience and little text message alerts and reminders that MCV send to my phone to remind me of my appointment are helpful. I have a tendency to forget or not write appointments down. Oh and Kirsten does an amazing job. Such talent.  Highly recommend

"I have been going here for about a year and love it! My stylist listens to what I want and I always leave feeling great. The massages while washing hair are so relaxing. They always offer tea and water and during the winter -warm cider, which was delicious.The only thing I don't like is that you can't put a tip on your card. Half the time I forget and have to run and get cash and go back.

"I'm basically an upbeat positive person...but some days I'm not my normal corky self. I arrived at Perry Monge flumoxed and in a bad mood--a special event meant that all nearby lots cost $12 for parking. Spending $12 for parking is spendy for a day in San Francisco...but in Phoenix for an hour Please. I mentioned this to the poised woman at the check-in desk who said that next time I should park in the lot at their building where they validated parking. She then brough out a yummy iced tea for me to sip while filling out the new client form. I went to the bathroom, which featured a delightful scented candle, and then Sandy () brought me to the changing room and then my chair. A surprise: shortly after sitting down in the barber chair a woman brought me over to have my shampoo--and gave me a brief massage first. The massageshampoo woman had a very positive energy to her. Marina cut my hair and, although she was not much of a talker, was upbeat and gave me a great cut. I've been looking for a great place in Phoenix and found it. No one will ever compare to my beloved Cid at Barbarella in San Francisco, but I do have a new favorite salon locally in the Valley of the Sun.

"Perry has been cutting my hair for about 4 to 5 years.  Whenever I walk out of there I cannot believe how my hair looks, and I oftern get complete strangers complimenting my cut.  Perry does a great job of taking my preferences and developing cuts that flatter me. What more can I askThe  massage before the shampoo is standard and more than once I've fallen asleep.  Once a couple years ago, in the late afernoon of a particularly frustrating day at work, they asked if I wanted anything to drink.  I said, only if you have vodka.  Next thing I know, a clear drink on ice shows up...and tasted suspiciously like vodka.  No that's customer service.
",1
"I absolutely love Perry Monge Salon!  I have been going there since 2004 and it has never disappointed.  The entire staff is friendly and makes you feel right at home.  Marina is amazing with hair...I only wish she could style my hair every morning!  The extra perks beyond an amazing hair cut are the chair massage before your wash and the hand massage during your cut!  I spend 75% of my time in Dallas and 25% of my time in Phoenix, but insist on only having my hair cut at Perry Monge!

"There is no doubting that I am an Aveda girl. Being in Phoenix and having plenty of Aveda salons around you would think I'd be beauty-heaven. But when I left Cleveland I was very hesitant to leave my hairdresser so I scheduled my hair appointments around when I'd be flying home. Well, as one could image, that become very expensive, so I finally decided to take a chance with Perry Monage downtown. I'm so glad I did! From the moment I walked in to the stylist, they were spot-on with customer service and they did an amazing job with my cut and color, too! There was a little up-selling me with products which I wasn't use to and I must admit, I did cave but I mean, Aveda, hello Can we say amazing!I'm still in love with Aveda and I'm now in love with Perry Monage.

"Best hair cut in town. Clean facility, friendly staff, and they are always very welcoming. Definately recommend getting your hair cut here...actually, I recommend getting them all cut - HA! (hair cut humor is just awful) If you are in to hair products, they have a great selection on Aveda stuff.

"I love this place! The customer service is second to none. The front desk staff is always friendly and helpful. I have a great hairstylist, and the other services I have received have been wonderful. Even when I am there just on my lunch break to pick up a few things, I am always offered something to drink. Products are recommended, but there is no pressure to make any purchases. It's comfortable, clean, and the staff is always on time. Yay for Perry Monge!!

"I was in the market for a new stylist since mine fled the Phoenix scene in search of cooler weather in Colorado. I went to my Aveda store to pick up some products and there was a stylist from Perry Monge, Marie Luce ( sp) gave me a coupon for 20.00 off so I decided to give it a try.OMG. From the moment I walked in I felt like royalty. I think I was getting the first timeservice but not only did I get one of the best haircuts, a styling, a 5 minute back massage, a very thorough hand massage, a facial ( yep),eyebrow waxing, a make-up refresher and an iced cappuccino. I wound up buying 3 products but I always buy something Aveda when I go so it wasn't a hard sell.I love my new look-my skin looks amazing and the total cost was 122.00 What! I had a 20.00 off coupon but still....It was brilliant marketing. I have found a new stylist and I will be faithful in getting a facial each time I go because it's so worth it. I highly recommend Marie Luce, she is amazing!

"Marina Ochoa. Amazing. 2 months later and I'm still getting compliments on the cut, and how healthy it looks. I've been going there for about 4-5 years, and will continue to do so!Marina will LISTEN to you. Tell her what you want, and she will give you ideas and suggestions. She won't push anything, including products. Though the products she recommends are always topnotch. She won't make you feel like you have to purchase anything.

"I have been going to the Perry Monge Salon for about 14 years.  I love this place!!  If you are Latina, have curly hair, and cannot find anyone to cut your hair andor style it because of the curl, this is your place!  Saturdays are busy, but I try to avoid them.  I am lucky, I work downtown so I am able to make an appt. right after work and not have to deal with the craziness of Saturdays.  Being a client for so long, I have tried their spa, waxing services, and of course hair services, and and happy with everything!  I have even recommended this salon to many friends and family, all of whom are still loyal clients.  An added bonus, my husband and I joined the Aveda Pure Privilege program, it took us approx. 4 years of saving our points, but in 2011, we had a 6 night stay in Jamaica!  It was absolutely wonderful.  We stayed at the Caves in Negril complete with complimentary massages.  Since then we have saved another 44,000 points and are looking forward to booking our 3 night stay in Antigua next year when we reach 50,000 points.

"I had the absolute best pedicure of my life today from Raisa.  My feet were in sad shape after months of neglect, and she worked on them for an hour and a half and turned them into gorgeous, soft, smooth, perfectly polished feet. I've been happy with pedicures at the spa at Camelback Inn and the spa at the Royal Palms  but  the pedicure I got today was nothing short of a miracle.  I would recommend Raisa's Signature Pedicure to anyone and plan to go back in a few weeks.  It was an indulgence, but it was completely worth it!

"I love this place!  I live out of state and recently called Elizabeth Arden for a gift certificate for my mother-in-law for Mother's Day.  I have done this annually for her for several years and she had always loved the service.  I must admit that I was going to go to a less expensive place this year...cut backs and the economy.  After reading reviews online, I selected a nail spa close by.  The service was really horrible on the phone.  I can only imagine what it would have been like in person.  I ended up not purchasing a gift certificate from them and instead coming back to Elizabeth Arden again.  Yes, I spent twice as much for her mother's day present...but I would rather pay double verses deal with poor service and questionable product.  When my mother-in-law comes here she is always happy and feels pampered on her special day.  And they really do gift certificates well.  I will not shop around again!!

"All I can say is I got my wife a massage package for Christmas last year and she hasn't stopped talking about it. She was glowing for weeks.

I don't have artificial nails, and I've always had problems with the polish on my nails chipping - like the very next day!!!  I don't know what Gina does, but the polish on my fingernails lasts a full week, and then they don't chip, they merely wear at the tips. And the toe polish lasts weeks & weeks! The warm 'bucky' on the shoulders is an added bonus as are the complimentary neckshoulder massages (when the masseuse has time)

"I have been coming to the Elizabeth Arden Red Door Spa since 2001.  David is a wonderful colorist and Frank cuts and styles my hair better than anyone I have had in my life.  I am Asian and my hair is not easy to cut, so kudos to Frank and all the other stylists that have filled in in the past when I didn't call ahead to book an appt.  I have never had a bad hair day since 2001.In the past year, I have seen Jon for therapeutic deep tissue massage.  Because of my work, a good massage is not just a luxury; it is a necessity.  I take my out-of-town girlfriends to the Phoenician to chill-out, but I take my back and shoulder issues to Jon.  He is the best therapeutic massage therapist I have experienced, and I am so glad he is at the Spa now. Selfishly, I am hoping he doesn't get too many requests after this post to still have time to fit me in!

Pricing was every bit of what i paid for. Quality and professional work and  I definitely recommend this shop to anyone and everyone who asks where a good place is to get this type of work done! :)

"After investing into higher end aftermarket car parts for my vehicle, I found a need (or want) for ceramic coating. Snail Motorsports came recommended to me from various friends, colleagues, and business partners. Being that the items I purchased were not a small investment, I decided to take the recommendations and bring my business to Snail.9 months later, I still continue to bring all of my ceramic coating needs to Snail Motorsports. Every order I've placed with Snail, small or large (cost, not only size) has been consistently of the utmost quality. As someone who chooses to invest his hard earned money on an item, it gives me relief to know Snail will always provide quality service, care, and most of all, GREAT customer service!To speak briefly about comparison, I've since had experience with other local coating shops. Although the quality and care of the work done elsewhere was sufficient, I will continue to use Snail's services when I need quality work done correctly the first time. Thanks Snail! Keep up the great work!

"We have gone with Snail Motorsports for so many things, since Juan started in his garage, doing small jobs.  He has powder coated an antique medicine cabinet, several sets of wheels, several parts for my Jeep, media blasted a ton of our chairs for our business...that ton equals out to around 300.  When he tells you when he will have your items ready, he is right there with it when he promises.  You can find him in his shop way into the late hours...just to get your item completed.  You will never find anyone more Type A about his finished product than Juan.  We have never been disappointed in any item or any quote we have received.  He does all of his own media blasting and powder coating...he doesn't farm them out to other contractors.  He service is top notch and I would recommend Snail Motorsports to everyone.  Thank you Juan and the Snail Motorsports team.

"I have huge trust issues when it comes to my car. At first I was really scared because I was getting $2k rims (Advan TCIII) and almost $3k worth of parts under the hood. Juan exceeded my expectations! They came out perfect. With the amount of work, time, and effort he put into them I'm surprised he didn't charge me more. He gave me an awesome deal! A few months later I brought a set of cheaper wheels (used set of enkei rpf1) and a few suspension parts to get coated and the work was just as phenomenal! Juan treated $800 worth of parts just as he would $5k worth of parts. I wouldn't trust anyone else with powder coating my car parts. I will always support quality work and that is why I will always be a customer of Juan and Snail Motorsports.

"Had Snail do a scooter frame for me. I was trying to save money and go with a cheaper option but they hooked it up with an awesome pearl multistage. After that had me do a set of wheels that came out perfect mounted and balanced as well. Powder coat isn't cheap but they were half as much as any other quotes I got. I send everybody I know there.

"I had all my engine caps and strut tower brace done here. The strut tower brace matches the car with with race stripes perfectly aligned with the oitside paint. Very professional and great pricing!!

"I took in all 5 wheels for my 1970 VW Beetle for powder coating.  They were looking pretty shabby after over 40 years of faithful service.  This VW was my first car, and I'm only the second owner (bought in '86).  It's very special to me, and I wouldn't trust any part of it to just anyone.My first contact with Snail Motorsports was via email, and Juan answered all my questions quickly and thoroughly.  Very clear on pricing and time to completion.  I took the wheels in, selected my color and went home to wait.  I was pleasantly surprised to receive a link to photos of my wheels after media blasting and at completion.  The work was done on-time and the whole process was very professional.  I couldn't be happier. Now, 2 years later, they look as good as the day I picked them up.You can't go wrong with Snail Motorsports for powdercoating!

"Had my Enkie RPF1s done a nice gold color. They were nice enough to install toms and also mount and balance the tires for free. The finish looks awesome and I get a lot of compliments on my 350z. Great customer service!

"Get it done and get it done ONCE! Powder-coating at its best! OR, use the other guys ((NOT))!

"I am a huge fan of Sushi Three. They live within walking distance of my home, so it's no problem getting here and the temptation for sushi is always in the back of my mind! Admittedly, the price of the food here tends to keep my cravings in check for a couple months at a time, but when I do come here, I enjoy every bite. Occasionally I also order take-out since they have very reasonable lunch deals, but really, I prefer to sit and eat at the restaurant itself.Speaking of: the place itself is very quiet, which I actually like; I can just sit, talk with a friend or read a book, and then (what a radical concept) enjoy my food in peace. This is a big deal for me because the other places I know of where I can get sushi are loud, busy, and quite frankly, a little limiting options-wise compared to Sushi Three's menu. If I want sushi, I either come here or I get a small pack at Giant Eagle. That's how much I hate the other sushi places I've visited in Pittsburgh. If I'm going to pay as much as I do for my fish, I want to be in a place I can sit and actually enjoy my food.By the way, Sushi Three does serve things other than sushi, so people looking for some Japanese food that isn't rice and fish are definitely going to find something. There's some really delicious beef, chicken and pork dishes. But of course, a place with the word ""sushi"" in its name is going to specialize in sushi, and there are pages and pages of sushi options available here. The orders come in various styles and sizes as well, so couples can get something to share or just get something smaller for themselves. The combos all come with soup and salad, which are also very yummy.I at this point have developed a routine order: a large salad and an order of softshell crab rolls are all I need here. Sure, I'll occasionally snag a bite from someone here with me, but the truth is that Sushi Three makes such enormous orders that I can't eat more than that without feeling a bit sick. But hey, at least you get your money's worth! I say definitely give this place a shot if you're a sushi fan.

"Great little neighborhood place. Food is good, service is great.  Try the tofu salad appetizer.

"I go there as a tradition with my best friend when she comes home and it's one of my favorite places. The resteraunt is quiet and low lit so it's very relaxing. Service is quick and friendly. The lunch specials are amazing deals and there's enough variety there that I never get bored with the choices. Their tempura is the best i've ever had, and the rest of their food is just as amazing. Their ginger dressing makes me want to drink it straight. Even thinking about it has set me drooling!

"Delicious sushi! Watched it be prepared in front of us and the entire place is super clean. Friendly staff. Highly recommend stopping here!

"This place has restored my faith in delivery sushi. For the longest time I could only eat it fresh (not delivery), but this is the second place ever I've found that I thoroughly enjoyed the sashimi appetizer, takosu, flower roll, and a spicy tuna roll with no asparagus. Of the two places ever, this is my new number one. The spicy tuna roll and and sashimi app were my favorites! The hubby got yellowtail fish jowl, and fried rice... Also very good. Delivery was on point and even the call to put in the order was smooth and easy.

"I have long wanted to eat Teppanyaki style food and been thinking of going to Benihana for a longest time. But after reading reviews on Yelp for the one in Sunnyvale, CA, I was quite apprehensive.I had also heard good things about Benihana in Pittsburgh from my brother in law and so decided to go there whenever I goto Pittsburgh.So, finally, we went there after New Years and had a blast. We had to wait at the bar even after making reservation, but thats OK. At the table we were not rushed at all. The food was tasty and the chef was funny and interesting. Not to mention very entertaining and friendly bartender  - MARTY.Overall, it was one of the best restaurant experiences we ever had.
",1
"I like this place it provides a great atmosphere and can handle big groups. They also send you a coupon for a free dinner on your birthday and can use it anytime during your birthday month.  I would recommend making a reservation as they are normally busy and it takes awhile to eat. But this is a great place to go for a special occasion.

"The atmosphere was fun. Our chef was very nice and entertaining. The filet was excellent.  Their salad dressing is a little harsh for my taste.  Over all it was a great time. I will definitely go back.

"I swore that Kobe Japanese Steakhouse in Orlando was the best one I had ever been to, but I think they may have some competition with this one.My boyfriend and I tried them out on Labor Day, just get something different from what we normally do. He had been some years back before, and this was my first time. Getting to the actual restaurant was a bit weird because of how you have to navigate the mountain (I don't know, is that considered a mountain, or is it a hill Being from the south everything that makes me lift my legsfeet higher is a mountain). It was rather empty as it was only like 11.30AM, but that was ok with us as we're not a big fan of people (joke ... maybe). The interior is ridiculously awesome, especially the raised bar.Our chef walks up and it's a white man, which was a definite first for me at a Japanese steakhouse. And he seemed out of it. During the course of the meal, he did inform us that he was hungover ... it's Labor Day, what're gonna do It didn't bother me too much, but I think he did annoy the hell out of my boyfriend lol. He told some good albeit corny jokes, did the usual tricks plus a few new ones - he was overall entertaining.The food: oh man, was it yummy. I got the soba noodles and beef julienne. The noodles were cooked in some type of sauce that I couldn't describe, but they were the best soba noodles I have ever had. The beef julienne was also super delicious. The sauce on it was described as a teriyaki sauce, but it didn't taste like it at all to me, which was fine with me because I'm not a big teriyaki fan. After eating we hit the bar and had drink apiece. The bartender was really cool and the bar area had a great vibe and atmosphere. Sure, Japanese Steakhouses are pricey, but this is one of the few I've been to that is more than worth it.

"The sushi during happy hour is great. The wife and I eat well for $20.  That's drinking pop though.  Don't judge.

"This is my favorite place to eat. The shrimp, fried rice, steak, sauces, and just everything are incredible. The prices can be a bit high but it is worth it!

"Benihana is by far our favorite steak and seafood place in the area. The food is so fresh. The chefs are great. The wait staff is excellent.  If you're looking for shrimp flying and loud chefs singing obnoxious songs then this is not for you. If you want a friendly  atmosphere and delicious food then this is your place. The sushi is fresh and tasty. The quality of food is obviously there.

"Love this place! Great sushi and have great sushi specials at lunch and HH. Bartenders are the best also. Marty is the man!

"Had a wonderful experience at Benihana with the family last night.  We love hibachi restaurants and go to various area restaurants on a regular basis.  Benihana is the oldest of the hibachi restaurants in the area, so we had not been for a while.  We arrived early before the rest of our party and the staff was very welcoming.  They would regularly stop by and make sure we didnt need anything.  After our party arrived, we were seated and our chef came out. He was very entertaining and the food tasted amazing.  The best part was how accommodating the staff was.  One member of our party had a food allergy and the manager specifically came over to ensure that all food would be made in the back and would not come in contact with other ingredients.We had our 2 year old daughter with us and part way through the meal she started squirming and wanted to walk around the restaurant.  After a few ""laps"" of the restaurant, without us asking, the manager came out with crayons and paper which made our daughter VERY happy.  Everyone was so pleasant and the food was better than I had remembered.  Benihana has a lot of competition from Saga, Nakama and others, but after our most recent visit, Benihana definitely has the best value and the best staff.  We visited Saga shortly after going to Benihana and just kept commenting on how much better Benihaha was.

"I've been coming here regularly for almost 30 years, basically since I was born, starting back when it was Samurai. Some of the older waitresses (Hide!) are like family at this point, so I may be a bit bias. The food is always good, the servers are friendly, and the chefs are entertaining without being obnoxious like a lot of other hibachi places. I'm not big on sushi, but what I've had is good. They have a fantastic selection of wines, beers, and sake. I'll probably be coming here for another 30 years.

"I've been in Pittsburgh for a long time, and if you read through my reviews, you'll see that I love eating in Pittsburgh. I'm from NYC, so it's not that my palate is easy to satisfy. I just really think that Pittsburgh has great restaurants with authentic, and tasty foods. I am a serious advocate of dining in Pittsburgh, and I take pride in knowing the good places to eat. There, those are my self-proclaimed credentials. So take this to heart: Andy's Sushi Bar (located in Wholey's) is probably the 1 place to get sushirolls in Pittsburgh. Now, a few caveats: it is NOT a restaurant, it is a stand inside Wholey's supermarket that does take-out orders ONLY. You will NOT get a dining experience, so for those of you who want to go to a nice japanese restaurant for dinner, you are not in luck. This sushi stand is only open for lunch, and typically closes at about 4pm on a weekday. You could be waiting about 15-30 minutes depending on the timeday you go because there is just one guy who makes the orders. He's fast, but his line can get long. Take it for what it is: Andy uses fresh and tasty fish. He cuts you big pieces for both his a la carte pieces and his rolls. He will make you any custom order you'd like provided he has the ingredients. He does have a limited selection of SushiSashimi platters. He has a good spider roll and after going a few times, definitely ask for the ""Chef's Special"" -- he just loads up a roll for you. You won't be disappointed.And, as for prices, it's the best bang for your buck for sushi. what more could you ask for.

"I love  Andy and he loves me. I used to come here every Sunday after church and order his special not on the menu rolls. Those are awesome.  They are really fresh and flavorful.

"Andy's sushi bar is a convenient little stand set up inside Wholly's in the Strip District of Pittsburgh. It's not a dine in type of place, but it is the best sushi I've ever had. Wholly's sells fresh fish and other meats, so a very convenient place for a sushi bar. My personal favorite of Andy's is the Philadelphia roll - without hot sauce! I used to work in the strip and would often walk down to Wholly's just to get sushi and talk to Andy.

"i would give andy 6 stars, if possible due to:1. amaaaaaaazing sushi.2. hilarious conversation.3. fresh, fresh, fresh ingredients.4. reasonable prices for the quality of food (which is stellar).5. andy's daily specials & inventive use of random sushi components (like mango & mint).6. FREE SAMPLES while you wait in line.andy is the best -- hands-down.
",1
"Oh Andy, how I miss your little swagger and sass! I know this is a difficult one to rate, since he runs a stand within another establishment (Wholeys) but I am giving 5 glowing stars nontheless for the amazing sushi he makes (right in front of you) and his stellar personality. I have never met a person with blood flowing in their veins that didn't get a total kick out of Andy.When I worked in the Strip, I ate here almost daily. After only two visits, he remembered exactly what I ordered and would start making it as soon as he saw me: spicy yellowtail with avocado. Or just yellowtail with avocado. Maybe some cucumber. Have I mentioned that I am obsessed with yellowtail Ahhhh, the buttery-ness, the texture, the slight taste of the sea....oh wait, this isn't a review on a singular fish, i got a little carried away (even though Andy serves up some damn fine YT)! Sometimes he gets creative and mashes different flavor concepts together for you to sample as you wait. He once came up with a maki roll made of salmon, basil, cucumber and mango....brilliant!!Wholeys is such a fantastic people watching spot anyway and it's always amusing to see random people of all agesgenderssizes walk in and yell ""ANDY""!

"Andy has the best Sushi. His special sauce is what makes his sushi the best.

"Listen, Pittsburgh is not a sushi Mecca and never will be, but Andy has fair prices, fresh fish, and is easily the most charismatic sushi chef in the city. Cool environment and great sushi. What more do you need. Is Penn Fish better, maybe, but not as entertaining.
",1
"As much as a sushi fan as I am I going to stick my neck out and say this is the best sushi in Pittsburgh.  Here is my reasoning.Andy is not just a funny guy, but is very generous.  Go when it's not busy and be prepared to be handed big chunks of raw fish with his different sauces.  Talk to him and get ready for sushi rolls bursting with fresh fish.  Next the place is in Wholey Fish Market, Wholey gets fresh fish daily, so you know his sushi is going to be some of the freshest in Pittsburgh.Finally, the price, load up on Andy's rolls and sashimi for the fairest price in the city.  Try Andy's roll and the Eel sashimi.Go see Andy for some great sushi and sashimi.
",1
"I swear Andy remembers every customer he ever had.  I only get to visit him a couple times a year but he always asks how my family is and tells me to say hello to them for him.  He always gives me a snack while I am in line as well.  I place pretty big orders and leave a generous tip, but he is just so kind and friendly.  And, I think his sushi is the best in the city even though the long line can be prohibitive.

"Andy is super entertaining, and serves up the best sushi in the burg!  Don't miss!

"To tell the truth, I have never had sushi here, but the Korean BBQ buffet (upstairs) is wonderful!  Lots of different meats and vegetables that you bring to your table and cook there.  The pork is great, there is beef, shrimp, fish, scallops, maybe  I forget it all, but there is a large variety.  And the experience is really fun if you have never tried it before.  At first we were a little worried that we might not cook the meat enough since they pretty much turn the stove at your table on and leave you to your own devices, with little guidance, but we haven't had any problems.  It is not very hard to do.  I love going here and eating a ton of delicious Korean BBQ!  For $19 a person, it is a great deal!
",1
"This is the first and only korean bbq i have ever visited.  that said, i can't wait to bring my whole family here at the end of the month for my birthday!  I had so much fun filling my plate with marinated treats and cooking them on my table!  it was a really amazing and unique  dining experience.if this place sucks compared to the average korean bbq, I can't wait to try an outstanding one! But for now, in Pittsburgh, I don't know of anywhere else like it.  and I'm in love.
",1
"Yelp didn't exist when I used to go here, back in the CMU days, but it is still my favorite Soon Du Bu (Tofu Stew) place - we just LOVED it.  We never ate sushi here, always the korean food.  The hae mul pah jun is yummy, the dol sol bibimbap is good, but the soon du bu jige is the best.  It's run by Koreans, hello!  We were lucky to have this place in Pittsburgh - it's not like there was a lot to choose from.  But even now, I rarely encounter a place (in the Bay Area) that has the same quality of tofu stew - and we have a ""k-town"" here!

"Sushi Kim Restaurant was awesome the food and service were top notch. If you are in Pittsburgh and are looking for great food stop here.  A++++. Try the Korean Short Ribs.

"I have been going to Sushi Kim for about 15 years. While some of the more harder to find items are not on the menu (abalone, anago, otoro), I have never been disappointed with the food or service there. Really good Korean food and very fresh sushi. Like I said, I have been going for 15 years and Mr and Mrs Kim never disappoint us.

"This place is cute! I adored their sushi as did the hot, spicy beefveggie soup I had with kim chee (I can't remember the names of everything). Great service too.

"Ate here last night and it was absolutely the best meal I have had at Sushi Kim. Wife got the usual pork bulgogi and I got standar dol sut bi-bim-bap. It was unbelievably good. It wasn't because I was really hungry. It was perfect. Every single bit of both meals was perfectly proportioned and seasoned. And the side dishes were GREAT except I really missed not having sweet potato and little omelet ban chan. I will cut out Dosani and Korean Kitchen as long as Sushi Kim keeps this up!

"For sushi, seaweed salad and beef bulgogi this place this place is five stars!!  Some of the best sushi in the Burgh.

"LOVE THIS PLACE! Real authentic Korean dishes! I just moved to Pittsburgh and their aren't really a lot of good asian styles food around. Went into sushi Kim thinking I would only order sushi, but my friend told me to order from their main menu. The short ribs are to die for! Plus they have homemade kimchi which was very tasteful. I came to this place about 5-7 times since I moved here. Love the Korean BBQ! GREAT SERVICE OVERALL! Prices are a bit to high but is worth every penny! DEFF COMING BACK!

"All righty!!! I have eaten sushi in Boston, NYC, Portland ME, Phily, Chicago, San Diego to name a few. This place is the best ever and I have never been disappointed. Located In Mt. Lebanon, a cool little suburb of Pittsburgh, This resturant does not mess around. The owner pays top dollar for all of his seafood and the chefs there are top notch. In the back of the resturant is a Japanese kitchen where you can order then watch 1 woman cook your food. Great spot for a date!! And Best Sushi this side of the missisip!!

"Little Tokyo is the restaurant where I first experienced sushi, so it will always have a spot in my heart.  However, after gaining a little more knowledge of sushi, I still believe Little Tokyo is one of the best.  For one, I have still not seen daikon rolls on a menu in Ohio, and they are one of my favorites.  Little Tokyo's avocado and kappa rolls are also excellent.  My favorite appetizer is the agedashi tofu, though the others are good as well.  The atmosphere is great for everything from a casual lunch to a pre-Homecoming dinner.  The service is attentive, providing you with hot towels to clean your hands before dinner.  They will validate your garage parking for one hour, and the mints in a jar at the cash register are delicious.I would highly recommend Little Tokyo, especially over Sushi Two (or Three, I never can remember) on Beverly Road.
",1
"This is by far the best Sushi in Pittsburgh.    The food is all amazing, very fresh and authentic,  and I still compare most places I have been to Little Tokyo.  Other than that, I don't have much to say because this restaurant really speaks for itself.  What you wont find here:  A trendy atmosphere like Nakama ( I picked Nakama because it is also so popular in PGH), but the sushi MORE than makes up for it.
",1
"Hurray Little Tokyo!  I haven't been here in years, but this is THE place that I got introduced to sushi.  I still remember hesitantly slurping down my first salmon roll thinking raw fish must be the most awful thing in the world... and well, kinda loving it.  The owners are good friends of my family, from back when we lived in Pittsburgh.  I remember when they were first starting out--my dad helped design and build the sushi counter, and my mom made the original cushions and server uniforms.  One time, I had an epic wasabi-eating contest with the owner's son.  On many a weekend as a kid I would go and stuff my face with all the sushi I could eat.  I know for a fact they use the freshest fish. I may be biased, but I think my early experiences with massive-sushi-overload helped refine my tastebuds and make me the sushi snob I am today.  Oh yeah, and they have FRIED ICE CREAM.

"Great sushi bar. The staff and owner are extremely attentive. Great presentation. Decent price too. And I got to sit next to Mario Lemeuix at lunch a couple weeks ago!

"I've tried sushi at all of Pittsburgh's sushi offerings and NONE of them can touch Little Tokyo. Every city has a ""best sushi place"" and this is Pittsburgh's. Hands down. I've enjoyed over 20 meals at Little Tokyo and never once have I experienced bad sushi or bad service.

"Awesome sushi. Nigiri sushi here is a must-try.

"Excellent sushi place for Pittsburgh - best I've found yet.  (Please don't expect West Coast sushi - I did qualify my statement by saying ""for Pittsburgh"".  I usually have to do this for Pittsburgh restaurants.)  Sushi was a little loosely prepared, but the fish seemed very fresh, and the presentation was nice.  The service was excellent, too.  Our waitress was very friendly, fast, and helpful.
",1
"I love, LOVE this place.  The sushi at this place is what I use as a basis to compare other sushi.  I had my first taste of sushi at Lil Toks which is why it has become my benchmark.  Now I will say that I have had better sushi at a few places (Umi in Shadyside , PA and Coast in Chicago), but for what your paying at this place you cannot get a better value for the quality.  Those other places that I mention you'll definitely be paying alot more for marginally better sushi - at least in my opinion.  So whenever I'm in the mood for some sushi I come to this place.I should also mention that they have the most amazing fried ice cream...ever...even better than Chi Chi's fried ice cream (for those who remember).  People it's seriously that good!
",1
"Love Little Tokyo. Dedicated customers keep the place full all week long and on the weekends. If cleanliness is important to you, this is the restaurant you want. You could safely eat off the floors. Staff is friendly but unobtrusive. A definite favorite.
",1
"You get what you pay for. I've never been even slightly disappointed. I've been coming here with a good friend for a few years, and it's a MUST every time I come back to town for a visit. On our most recent visit I had the sushi platter entree. It comes with 8 pieces of nigiri sushi and a maki roll in the middle. The salmon nigiri is incredible. Eat it slowly.  SAVOR it!  I'm thinking about going back just for that one more time before I head back to Arizona. Also, their desserts are exquisite.  The dessert menu changes, but again, I've never even come close to feeling disappointed.  I don't care much for sweets but the dessert here is SO good that I order something every time.  P.S. Don't wear a short skirt in case you get seated at a tatami table!

"I ate one of the top 2 meals of my life in this restaurant.It was the first time i had heard of ""omkase"" (or chef's choice of many small courses), and despite the hefty pricetag, I was celebrating and opted to try it.oh. my. god.   an absolute slamdunk.  I can't imagine going here and not getting that unbelivable sampler.  my mouth is watering as i type.

"I believe I've found my new favorite restaurant. After being rather dissapointed with Chaya last night, I decided to go to Umi tonight.The staff was friendly and service perfect. There servers watch for you to dictate the pace of the meal.Beggining with the typical salad with ginger dressing: I was very happy with this dressing, just about perfect.Next the miso soup: I'm not generally a huge fan of miso soup, but this was probably the best preparation I've had. I could have gone for another bowl. For my entree I chose the dinner sushi assortment. This was by far the best sushi I've ever tasted. As cliche as it may sound, every piece (including fin which is notoriously tough) was melt in your mouth good.  The accompanying sauces are not overbearing in the least, they merely enhance the flavor of the fish.  The pieces of nigiri themselves are bite size - as in 1 bite without looking like you're stuffing your mouth.  This is smaller than the giant balls of rice with large cuts of fish you often times see at other places. I rather enjoyed the size, but just wanted to make note of it. The tuna roll was also very tasty. I did not sample any other rolls tonight, but I'm sure I will be back to do so.My dining companion had the chicken teriyaki.  The dish came out sizzeling from the back kitchen.  Again, this was probably the best preperation of the dish I've ever tasted. The serving size was perfect, about 5oz of very tender breast meat, with accompanying vegetables and a small side of rice.  More than enough to satiate, without the need for a nap afterwards. I didn't sample the desserts tonight, but I've seen others rave about them. I will definitely be back, as often as I can. I don't really care to try sushi anywhere else in Pittsburgh.

"Went to this place with my friends. Everything we had was amazing. The appetizers were delicious. This is what I ordered:1. Miso Soup: Was awesome!!!! very flavorful. My only complaint is there wasn't enough Wakame for my likening. But over all, it was AWESOME!! 1. Black cod with Miso: This fish was cooked perfectly and literally melted in the mouth. The flavor was mild and perfect. 2. Tuna Tataki: This was slices of Ahi Tuna slightly seared from the outside and rare in the inside. It was to die for!!! 3. Shrimp and Asparagus Maki roll: Probably not a great choice to begin with, this was okay, nothing to rave about. 4. Fuji Maki Roll: This had Crab and avocado and sesame seeds on the outside. It was delicious!!! 5. My friend had the assorted Sashimi. The serving was huge so i got to try some of his stuff. The white tuna was delicious as was the salmon.

"Great sushi for serious sushi eaters.  The omakase is expensive but definitely the way to go. Quite the adventure.  The sauces the chef puts on the sushisashimi is what makes the difference.The black cod dish is unbelievable.

"Anyone who says that there's no good sushi in Pittsburgh (and I've heard you say it, folks, right here on Yelp!) hasn't been to Umi yet. I'd been mostly satisfied, sushi-wise, by quality if standard places like Little Tokyo in the South Side and Chaya in Squirrel Hill before I went to Umi with my roommate last Saturday. The first major difference between Umi and the places mentioned above: price. Umi, a Big Burrito joint, is much more expensive than other sushi places in town. That said, if you have the dough, go for the $75person omakase. We enjoyed eight courses (7 dinner + 1 dessert course), each one subtle and well-seasoned and incredibly fresh. (Now we're broke, but that's my cross to bear.) The black cod and the nigiri course were stand-out favorites. The prices on the a-la-carte sushi, in contrast, looked only slightly more costly than others in town.The second difference: innovation. Sometimes, I just want straight-up, unadorned sushi, and when I do, I doubt I'll come back to Umi. However, if I'm looking for a fine dining experience, one where the ingredients are creative and innovative, I'll definitely return here. One of the best meals I've had in PGH yet!A final caveat: don't forget to make a reservation. The restaurant was packed when we were there, and due to its small size, I doubt they can squeeze too many walk-ins in on a busy night.

"Best sushi in Pittsburgh that I've found so far.  So what qualifies me as knowing good sushi  First off I'm Japanese American =)  Not saying that other ethnic backgrounds don't know what good sushi is.  By the reviews I can tell that they do.  But keep in mind I have been eating sushi my WHOLE LIFE!  The price of food is a little higher than one might expect  so if you're a casual sushi eater, you might think twice before coming here.  The restaurant setting feels pretty authentic.  Be sure to make reservations.

"A nice quiet atmosphere with good service and excellent food. I've tried many sushi places in Pittsburgh, and flavorpresentation wise, this was clearly the winner. The sushi here is so good you want to just let it melt in your mouth and savor each piece. Only drawback is the price! Highly recommended.

"My favorite restaurant in town.Here is the deal with Umi - if you are a casual sushi eater and just a fan of your basic rolls and stuff, don't bother going here. Umi is expensive, rolls will seem small - same as the sashimi and nigiri.However, it is so darn delicious I can't even describe it.  If I could, i would go to Umi every night.  It's simply that good.  It's well, well worth every cent you will spend.Also, try the rock shrimp.  Oh man.I think I am gonna go make a reservation right now.

"This is the real deal...in Pittsburgh. Don't expect flop down for a casual California roll here. They take the sushi and the experience very seriously. The downside is that it you'll never be satisfied with average sushi again.Pro tip: make reservations days in advance.

"This has always been my favorite Chinese Restaurant in the Pgh area. Food is consistently very good - General Tso's is tender, not the shoe leather I sometimes get at other places. Steamed dumplings, wonton soup, lo-mein, all terrific.

"I'm very particular about Asian food. Let me emphasize very one more time. Very.I usually have poor experiences, but I was pleasantly surprised with Tai Pei. Both times I dined there, I was greeted, which seems to be a lost art these days, and seated immediately. My waiter was just around the corner and greeted me with water. Both times I ordered sushi, I was able to see it being prepared, which is always a plus. My waiter was quick and served me as soon as the sushi was ready. The second time I went, I ordered sushi and an entree. The service was good but took a while for my main dish to be served. I only mention this since the restaurant wasn't packed.Still, the food was wonderfully prepared. I consider Tai Pei one of my favorite spots!

"Everything I ate here was just amazing.    I too am picky with Chinese food, as there are so many places that serve sub par food.  This is not one of them.  I will definitely be going back.
",1
"Honestly, every aspect (besides our weird waiter) was great.  My food tasted very fresh, and even though the server was a bit awkward and strange, he was very attentive.  It's the best Chinese food I've had in ages.

"Really good food and good service. The Chinese is the best and most authentic in the area.

"Consistently excellent.  I enjoy their sushi and know when I get a chicken dish I don't have to guess if it is eatable always good white meat.   I typically do take out and it is well worth the drive
",1
"Excellent Chinese food.   Every time we have ordered take out from here, it's been great.  Egg Rolls, General Tso's, Happy Family, Triple Delight, dumplings...all taste delicious.
",1
"I have only had takeout from Tai Pei, but the chicken lo mein was delicious and the general tso's was the best I have ever had! It was sweet, but still had a kick to it. Nothing was over priced and we weren't waiting forever for delivery. Will definitely visit the restaurant in the future!
",1
"The food here is very good. I've frequented the restaurant many times for sushi, noodles, rice, and plenty of their other dishes. The atmosphere is also great and the service is very friendly. I would definitely recommend Taipei if you're craving Chinese and sushi.

"I've always loved this bar and have gone since it opened.  Love Paul, the best bartender in the world. Once he waits on you, you pretty much never have to tell him your order again. Great apps!  But I must admit I haven't gone lately due to having to pay to park after 5pm.  Think its ridiculous.  Great people watching !

"I've never been for the food but on a fridaysaturday night love going for a great margarita and for a good price. I've tried margarita's all over charlotte, not to sound like a slush, but this one is the best by far.

"I've been going to Fujo's for the last 5 months or so and I must say that after a long day of work, their seafood su and dragon roll always hit the spot.  They also have Chinese food if you actually want your fish cooked.  And the service is consistently fast and friendly.  Five stars!
",1
"This is the first time I've been here.  First of all the Singapore Noodles was the best I have ever tasted in my life and I've had several.  The waitress was great.  The bus boy literally came around every 5 minutes to make sure everyone had water and he took the dirty dishes away right away.  I don't mind saying I may eat here again tomorrow!

"While staying in Uptown Charlotte we decided on sushi for dinner. Based on a yelp search we looked for a reasonable priced, well reviewed, ready walking distance option from our hotel.  This one is rated with two $$.  Truthfully some of the best sushi I've ever had.  My boyfriend and I split 3 rolls; the coastal roll, panther roll, and the Godzilla roll.  They were not skimpy by any means, there was almost am entire roll left when I had to give up, so the man happily picked up the slack.  I'm only on town for the weekend, so I have no idea if they run specials throughout the week.  I will absolutely come back next time I'm here, and will recommend to my friend who live here and visit here (only 3 hours from home)
",1
"I was traveling for work and stayed at the Hilton so figured I would check Fujo out. Great service and really delicious sushi! The prices were very reasonable and the portions were large. I got a spicy tuna roll (always good) and a volcano roll and they were so good. I also got a rainbow martini, which was yummy. I'll definitely go back when I travel to Charlotte.
",1
"You know what's crazy I've been to this sushi joint like at least 20 times and this is the first time I've actually checked in. I gotta step my game up. Anyhow... Godzilla Sushi Roll is the truth! You can't go wrong, ordering that. I'm seriously stuffed after eating. I mean, the crunchy tempura outside, the savory sauce, the fresh avocado... The ingredients make love in my mouth. Seriously. In my opinion, there's no need to try anything else.Service is spot on. Every time I'm there, everyone is very attentive, and you can't beat the area. I always find a spot to park on 3rd street and when it's nice and warm out; eating outside just makes it all worthwhile. Even if I have to put quarters in the joint to park on a weekday. It's worth it! I go hard for some sushi, especially the Godzilla roll. Get on it!

"i am from Cali; and we love our sushi; was worried that i might never find good sushi while here. This place proved me wrong; great sushi; super quick for call ins and across fom my school; so excited! Might be a weekly place for me!!

"Bought a Groupon here to try it out, and decided to buy another because we knew we'd come back!Go for dinner, sit outside, and enjoy an amazing view of downtown, something you can't really get from many uptown restaurants. Views of many buildings, but set back from the street, just a really great location for evening.Sushi: they have interesting rolls like ones with sweet potatoes that I've never seen any where else. Really yummy sushi of all types.Drinks: really good mixed drinks and sake! Limited wine and beer.Service: Truly excellent!
",1
"I have had a lot of good sushi in Charlotte, but the Godzilla roll at Fujo just completely blew me away.  It is the best sushi I have ever had.  Delicious just doesn't fully describe it.  When the menu says ""Must try"" they aren't kidding.  It is spicy tuna and avocado fried tempura style and topped with special sauce.  The sauce was superb.  The roll is large, so it is a good one to share, but you won't want to because you will want to eat it all yourself.
",1
"Have you ever left a place and thought: What took me so long to get here That happened to me at Fujo's. My girlfriends and I celebrated my birthday here and the sushi and drinks knocked my socks off. Yep, I'm officially a fan! I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for some good and reasonably priced sushi! We started with the steamed pork dumplings. Classic. I also ordered the Rainbow Martini-- it's cranberry vodka, pineapple and midori. The presentation was excellent and they were VERY heavy handed with the liquor.  And there's really just no need to go on and on about just how happy that made the birthday girl! That thing is delicious.But let's get to what everyone wants to know about...the sushi! I ordered the Godzilla Roll and decided after the first bite it's officially my ""go to"" roll when I'm here. I clearly see why it's mentioned in so many reviews and why it's listed as a ""must try"" on the menu. It's packed with spicy tuna, avocado and then deep fried tempura style. My goodness. How could you go wrong with that combination  Do yourself a favor and get over to Fujo's! It's definitely worth a try!

"Best sushi I've had so far in Charlotte! Make sure you try their Coastal Roll; my husband and I were floored by the sushi quality and the price!Wonderful restaurant and evening all around!

"The Sushi ReviewCuisine MalayaPacific Rim ShotOne of the best features of this establishment is its choice location. It's not so out-of-the-way that you have to travel to nightlife and not so on-the-scene that it would attract curious passers-by. I first visited this place to sample the Indian fare which had a good spin on the campus at CPCC. Of course I was drawn to the cliche 1950's pacific-rim archaeologist motif (fan-tan, folding fans, bamboo, etc.) but it was just slightly interesting as compared to the sushi menu, which was surprisingly diverse. The Maki rolls were above average and the Soundboy roll (spicy tuna or smoked salmon Philly tempura) was very good. They have a good selection of Japanese beer and the house sake is the only warm sake on the menu, so there is no immediate reason to order the fancy-pants selections, unless you are trying to impress someone - but that can easily backfire like a '79 Dodge Aspen going up a hill. Stick to what you know, or at least what you have learned so far. The Maki is solid and the Nagiri is good as well. The price is a little above average but you get a decent portion of good sushi. Try the Asahi bottled beer with the warm house sake. If you bring a date you can easily share. The Indian pancake is great for a shared appetizer. The Indian side of the menu is pretty good as well, so give it a shot on your following visit.I recommend Malaya overall for the sushi, location and atmosphere. Afterward, you can take the short drive Uptown and check out the scene.

"Each time I've eaten here, I've been pleased with the food.  The Beef Rendang is wonderful--the lemon grass flavor is prominent and the pepper is just right--not overpowering.  You'll want to start off with the Roti Canai appetizer, which is great--just don't dribble the curry sauce on your tie, 'cause it ain't coming out.  The peanut butter pancake dessert thingie is fun, too.  The Mango Chicken is aromatic and tasty, but I prefer their Rendang to anything else.  I think they do a fine job with the sushi and rolls as well.  I'm looking forward to trying other items here.  If you're not sure about this place, try it.  I think you'll like it.

"One of the BEST Asian restaurants in Charlotte hands down. I was shocked it was not already on Yelp.They specialize in Malasian Food, but offer a fusion of Japanese (sushi & hibachi), Chinese, and Thai inspired dishes. Honestly I have not tried the Hibachi, but the sushi is among the best, even over sushi specific restaurants!Don't be scared of the term ""Malasian"", if you are not familiar with it. There is not a single person I have ever taken there that has not loved it, and become a regular patron. Even the ""standard"" Chinese Restaurant dishes are really good- Kung Pao Chicken or Shrimp, Chow Fun, and fried rice. Try the Roti Telur for an appetizer. It's a savory Curry Broth with potatoes (don't think of Indian Curry), it's mild and I think it tastes similar to Thai Massaman curry. Comes with homemade bread pancakes for dipping. Also the Beef Satay is very good.The wait staff is usually very helpful to new customers that are not familiar with the dishes.They do a great Lunch Menu and are very fast with service.Located next to CPCC campus downtown, this place is a must try!

"Great place for authentic south east Asian cuisine. Malay, Indo, Chinese. I have been here once before and really enjoyed the food. Having spent time in Indonesia it is hard to find true authentic food from there. This is the only place in Charlotte for the real deal. If Ian is in, ask for him to help you make your food selection. There is much that isn't on the menu. Ian is the bartender an server. He is Malay and speaks excellent English and has an amazing amount of knowledge about the culture and food influences throughout the SE Asian peninsula. Ian hooked us up last night with some outstanding Malay dishes. We had sea bass that was lightly battered with a mouth watering curry with eggplant, green beans, okra, and onions. The spices in this dish blended perfectly well and I began to understand some of the differences between Indonesian and Malay cuisine that Ian had tried to explain. We also had the beef rendang, that was tender and fragrant. This is slow cooked beef in coconut milk and spices. We topped off our meal with a Asian style flat pancake folded over some ground  peanuts and palm sugar that was grilled in a pan to blend the flavors and served with vanilla ice cream.  The only thing that could have enhanced this dish might be a drizzle of chocolate sauce. Yum!We look forward to returning and having Ian take care of us again.

"One of the best Spicy Tuna rolls in town. LOVE the hot and Sour soup and they are always so nice in there! My fiance is not impressed with the Chinese food on the menu but the rest makes up for it. Plus, they deliver :)

"Loved, loved, loved Cuisine Malaya. In fact, I immediately wanted to rush home and lose my Yelp virginity after eating here! When you first walk in, it looks like your run of the mill Asian style restaurant. Don't let that fool you. There is magic in the food and service! Orchids hang in boxes on the wall, there is a bar to sit at where the sushi chef rolls his art, and pop music plays on the speakers.  Once seated, we were almost immediately welcomed by our server Ian. Ladies and gentlemen, if you can request Ian upon arriving, DO IT! He is Malaysian and gives you a rundown of all of the cultures that contribute to Malay cuisine. This gives you an idea of some of the items that you would like to try. He also brought a sample of curry to gauge our tastes. After the sample, we practically put our faith in his hands and let him suggest whatever. My friend and I decided to go with the beef rendang (which is so good it will make you scream BOOYAH!) and  the basil duck. The basil duck was off the menu. It came with stir-fry style veggies and the duck on the side. Warning! This dish may make you moan like Homer Simpson. The duck is that good. We also tried a few imported beers, thanks to our oh-so-helpful Ian. I would suggest this restaurant to anyone looking for different flavors. I had a really great experience and look forward to more!

"Cuisine Malaya is probably one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte. It is also a really good place to go with large groups because they have plenty of space, there is never a wait, and they can accommodate very large groups at one table. Also, the last 2 birthday celebrations we had there with large friend groups, we called in advance to make the reservation and let them know it was a birthday party, and they put up decorations in our area that we were seated at! That was definitely exemplary service.  They also let us bring our own birthday cake and kept it in the fridge in the back and then cut and served it for us after blowing out the candles.  Now on to the food.  The food is always so good.  They are also very large portions, so definitely can share one dish between 2 people.  The roti tellur appetizer is amazing and a must to order if you have never had it.  I also really like the kung pao tofu - the tofu has the perfect texture and crispness.  You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu - everything I have had has been great!

"YUMMM...This place has delicious food and good service.  My favs are the Curry Lakhsa, Mee Goreng, and Tom Yum soup.  It's gotten to the point where my addiction is obvious.  I literally eat here once a week now and if I don't they get worried about me.  The other great thing is that if you want to change up your order (like add more veggies to the sesame tofu, also delicious) no problem!

"I love Diane & her face painting! She will be doing my son's bday parties for as long as he is a kid, as well as our business events. She has worked for us a total of 3 times, and she has made each of our private & public events a hit! LOVE IT!!!!!!

"This is kind of late! But as my prev reviews says....Diane will keep doing the face painting at any bday parties I have for my son! She is amazing!

"Ok, so this lady is seriously talented.Seriously.Like artist talented.  These aren't your typical, run of the mill face paintings.I'll attach a few pics of the work she did on my hand and my boyfriend's face (he wanted a painting to look like he fell into a cactus)I like.

"Awesome!  It is sooo much fun for me to take part in activities that make me feel like a kid again!  Honestly if acting child-like could be considered a hobby, I'd say it's my favorite hobby!  That being said, this artist made me feel like a beautiful little girl all over again!  She was so sweet and so swift with her painting!  Wow!  I told her to just paint whatever felt right.  :)  She painted my pretty swirly, starry design in like 5 minutes tops!  And she did it all with a smile!  :)  I hope she will be at the Ostrich Fest in Chandler, and I hope I can get my face painted by her again!  Awesome!

"Dianne really is Frickin' Awesome!We met her today at the Yelp event at Kiwanis park. She did face painting on myself, my boyfriend, and two of my female friends. Everyone was fantastic. She can and will paint literally anything you ask for butterflies, gnomes, dinosaurs, motorcycles, whatever.She is also a total sweetie and was pleasant to deal with. I will be hiring her for my 30th Birthday party.

"Wow ! how does she do it She takes about 5 minutes , a load of colors and you end up with a personalized , stylized gorgeous picture. It looked like she waved a magic wand and magically made it happen! My daughter was thrilled and went home and promptly took a picture so she could remember how beautiful it looked.

"Dianne is amazing. AH MAY ZING.  You have no idea the absolute amazingness and awesomeness that come out of her brush. From a blackred biker chick rose on my bicep to a crab fighting a shark on a small child to an out of this world T-rex on my friend's cheek, she does some of the best freehand facepainting I have ever seen.Not only that, but she has an excellent presence, and is sweet, kind, and good with both adults and children. Plus, she had glitter!I was incredibly impressed with her, and wished that I was having my wedding in AZ. If so, I'd definitely hire her to add a little sparkle (pun totally intended) to our special day.

"I have to say, on one of the busiest days for me, it was also very easiest with the help from Fancy Faces.I booked Party Time with ""Belle"" for 1 hour and a glitter tattoo for 2 hours with them on line via their web site and got everything set up with them.Day of the party, which was obviously very hectic, I didn't have to instruct or anything.  They came and figured out where to be and when to entertain.""Belle"" came looking just as we expected and nothing less.  She looked good enough to be in Disney LandWorld live-action plays.  She talkedwalkedlooked like Belle.  Glitter Tattoo artist also came with her own chair and table and got her self set up in a convenient place and under the shade.Only thing was that the glitter tattoo artist came on time but forgot her glitter glue so she had to leave and come back.  She stayed past the original time to make up for the delay.  Regardless though, all the kids loved her and all the tattoos were done great.I would definitely encourage everyone to give this place a try.  They have a lot more than just glitter tattoo and characters.

"I have been using Fancy Faces for almost a year now for different events and I have to say, they are AMAZING!! Dana and her husband are extremely nice people and they are very flexible to work with you for what you need. I am a big fan of this company and will highly recommend this company to anyone.

"This hotel is located on the 15th floor of theAjo Sun-Times. It is in a great location for visiting the city, seeing the sites and SHOPPING! There are many restaurants near the hotel and Starbucks is just over the walkway to the Market Place. We ate in the bar one night while watching football! It was expensive, for two appetizers, four drinks and dessert I split the bill with my friend! I would suggest going around the corner for food! Also, just so you know, parking is $45 a day!

She even did balloon twisting even though I only asked for face painting. She was very professional and courteous to the party. Awesome, awesome, awesome! Highly recommend her to everyone!

"We found Fancy Faces at The Winter Wonderland in DTLV this Christmas. My daughter immediately lead us in her direction to get her face painted. There were plenty of options displayed which was helpful since most children are very visual & indecisive. It was quick & easy for them to pick and choose what they wanted. Ann is a very talented artist, not to mention friendly & patient. She took her time and added little details like glitter and outlines, the outcome was great! My daughter was so pleased with her face painting, she literally cried when it came time to wash it off. Thanks for doing such a fantastic job Ann. We'll definitely keep you in mind when the kiddos birthdays come around. :)

"THE nicest people you will ever meet.  I have been going here once per week for a few weeks for polish changes.  They do a great job and make it an enjoyable experience.  It is very clean inside and nicely decorated. I rarely have to wait more than 5 minutes and they never seem rushed.  I usually have my 3 year old with me who sits on my lap, and they talk with her and make her smile.  I am finally getting to writing a review because of a wonderful experience I had today.  I decided to take my two girls in for Valentine's day nail painting as a special treat.  My oldest went first and I was watching with my other daughter on my lap.  My youngest accidentally bumped a bottle of nail polish off the table which proceeded to smash all over the floor.  I was mortified.  They immediately began telling me ""don't worry, don't worry!"" And my daughter was looking pretty sad because she knew she messed up.  They were coming up to her and saying ""don't be sad, it's ok!""  Afterward when they wanted to charge me next to nothing for doing the girls' nails, I wanted to leave a large tip as an apology and a thank you.  They wouldn't let me!  So of course I did anyway and just told the gals to split it.  I still feel terrible about the mess but am amazed at how nice they were about it.  Please go here and support these folks and their wonderful business!

"I having been going to Su to have my nail tips done for 14 years.  I have never had a nail lift or ever had a fungus.  There have been times I have not been able to get back for a month and still no problem.  I also have pedicures by Eileen and they last just as long. The establishment is always clean and the staff is very friendly.  I give the highest rating possible and advise everyone to give them a chance.

"I'm a Cosmetologist who had the brilliant idea of doing her own acrylic nails. Why I thought I'd be able to do them beautifully when I hadn't done nails since cosmo school, is beyond me, but I was up for the challenge, I guess Well, it turned out (you guessed it) to be a complete disaster. I did them Wednesday night and Thursday morning wanted them off. I was pressed for time because of work and bc of leaving for San Diego today (Friday).The owner and his wife were more than accommodating. He pushed back his gym session Thursday evening bc he knew this was a 'nail emergency' and his wife took over to do the nail art design. I had a picture from Pinterest that I showed them and they matched it as closely as possible, and it turned out very nice. I posted a picture (mine is the blue, gold glitter, and peacock feather).They were all very friendly and welcoming and you can tell they really enjoy doing nails-it shows in their work and what perfectionists they are.I asked how long they'd been there and he said since 2000 which was really surprising to me because the place is so clean it looks like they just opened.So, as a nail salon it really doesn't get much better than this. They've won me over which really doesn't happen often since they're pretty much on every corner.Had to spread the word.Kelsey

"I've been going to this Spa for several years now.  The ambiance is great.  While waiting for my spa treatment, I relax in their quiet room and enjoy a glass of wine and some snacks. The owner, Maryann, gives excellent facials and does amazing permanent makeup.  I had my eyebrows and eyeliner done.  It looks so natural.  She knows what she's doing!  I get my massages here too and even bikini waxes.  If you want a great haircut and color, see Brandon or Kim.  It's awesome to be able to come to one place for all these services and know that you'll be taken care of.  I would recommend this spa to anyone.

"Always 5 stars for Julie! She's the only one I'll let touch my hands and feet. I followed her from Luxy nail salon, it's worth the extra 5 min to get my nails done.

"This is my new go-to place for pampering. Lots of services to choose from! I'm still exploring the options but I love my facials by Wendy. Top notch pro! And Maryann's vascular treatment for facial blemishes is nothing short of amazing. (There's a bit of a healing process to plan for, but the results are remarkable!) The support staff is warm and friendly, the spa area is cozy and relaxing, and mimosas are served as you prepare to  let your cares melt away. The spa is a challenge to find the first time, but well worth the effort to keep looking. Next time I'll be back for a couple's spa day. Can't wait!

"I randomly found this place through a spawish gift card. What a find!I'm a last minute lucy, I called for a full head of highlights, base and cut appointment for the next day and they were extremely accommodating, getting me right in and setting me up with Leslie. She was fantastic, very nice, welcoming and a wizard with foil (and there was a lot of foil!) It had been a LONG time since I had my hair done. When you're that neglectful and asking so much you never really know what end result you're going to get but I was pleasantly surprised. Leslie was very thorough and carefully in transforming me back into the natural blonde I should have been. Looks like I found my new hair magician...

"Three girlfriends and myself had a fabulous spa day here.  We flew into Las Vegas, rented a car and went straight to the spa.  I had arranged all of our appointments with Jackie and we can't praise her enough for the great professional service she gave us.  We each had facials, massages, manis and pedis and in between treatments we relaxed in the nicely appointed lounge area  where we were served mimosas and snacks.  Each of us were so happy with our treatments, the package price was very reasonable and we all left refreshed and ready to start our vacation in Las Vegas. Highly recommend this spa.  Everyone is very friendly and attentive.  We hope to return again and make this our first stop before going any place else.  Thank you Jackie and to all the staff that made the start of our vacation so great.  I rated the price as moderate because compared to what the big casino spas want for just a massage...this is priced so fair for the package we received. Sylvia R.

"If your in need of any permanent makeup this is the place!  I have been to many permanent makeup places over the years and this place exceeds.  Min is the artist and she does outstanding work.She listens to how you want your makeup done, the color the shape and when she finishes it's just as you described it.I had my eyebrows done.  This is not something you want to trust anyone doing, but after I was refered to Min, I thought I'd try it.  I was pleased.
",1
"I had my eyebrows tattooed 5 years ago by Min and she does free follow-up annual touch-ups for up to 5 years. So... I had them touched up at least twice. Scheduling the free follow-ups are about 2 months out so it's not like you can just walk in. However, it's pretty cool that she offers it.I was very happy with my brows and have since gone in for some of the facial with LED light treatment packages to reduce the age spots freckles on my face. The process of ridding some of the larger dark spots include burning them off and then staying OUT OF THE SUN while the skin heals back a lighter more blended tone to the rest of your face. She also gives you a bleaching cream to put on the skin to further ensure lightening of the spots. It worked! My face looks more clear than before the treatments. I'll be returning to try out the 3D eyebrows and will update the review once it's done.
",1
"I have since gone back for my 3D eyebrows and I'm very happy with them. Pricing is affordable and really awesome that I no longer have to pencil in my eyebrows or worry about rubbing my eyebrows off during the day. I've uploaded a picture of my 3D eyebrows after having them done about a year ago and since having 2 touch ups. I go back about once every 3 to 4 months. Recently I paid for 5 dermabrasion facials and 16 LED light treatments. Unfortunately my schedule SUCKS ass lately and I can't seem to find time to actually go back and DO the facials. Waaaah.

"AWESOME! Fast, easy, professional.

"Min has been doing permanent makeup for something around 30+ years! I got my eyebrows done by her about a year ago.Pros:- Min is very experienced  - Permanent makeup comes with 5 free appointments for touch ups - Competitive prices- Rooms are clean - Variety of services offered- Friendly and helpful staffConsultbefore the tattooing: An assistant draws in the shape you want with an eyeliner pencil. I did have some doubt right before I got my brows done. My natural eyebrows were very thin and each were very different in shape, length, etc, and it's always been difficult to draw them on evenly. But, the assistant was very patient and helpful and spent probably half an hour making my eyebrows the shape I wanted them. Getting them tattooed: Min, having been doing this for so long, is confident in what she does, so she does move a little fast. But be assured, she knows exactly what she's doing. I told her I was still a little unsure of the shape of my right brow but she said not to worry, she would fix it, and she picked a color that would look good on me. Obviously when you're about to have something tattooed onto your face, you want to be 100% sure about everything before you start. I had a little doubt about the shape of the right brow and if the color was too dark, but I couldn't be more happy with the results. My brows look very natural and people are surprised when I tell them they're tattooed because of how subtle and natural they are. OVERALL: Would recommend! Experienced and friendly. Great prices. I'm very happy with my permanent eyebrows!

"I love coming to min's.  I been coming since I was 17 and now I'm 27. I only trust Min. Her staff is always polite and knowledgeable.

"Had 3d eyebrows and full lips done this last Monday. I am very, very happy with the results. I look totally natural. Min is very professional and accommodating. Her assistant is very sweet and pleasant. I was a really big baby about the pain to my lips when they were done but Min worked with me and got me through it (lips hurt a lot!). I will go back in 3 months to have the touchups done and maybe get eyeliner done too. I would recommend Min's Permanent Makeup for anyone looking to enhance there looks with a very talented makeup tattoo artist.

"My stylist is Danyl and she is the best hair stylist, colorist I have ever met. Her talent, nohow and current knowledge with the latest movement in hair is refreshing and worth every bit she charges and more. She doesn't over price, she gives her all to you during your appointment and her personality is an A+. She is innovative and fresh. Soon the salon will be moving to a new building right up the street and I believe that this will only amplify her cliential, so if you want a great stylist...BOOK NOW.

"I am a bit psycho when it comes to my locks. I have never gone to the same stylist more than 2 or 3 times because they could never get it right. I bet I have tried 100 salons in Vegas over the years and was never satisfied. They could either color well, but cut disastrously, or cut great but couldn't style right, etc.  Your stylist has a huge impact on your appearance, ya knowAfter extensive research on finding an awesome colorist, Kim at Montage was recommended. After my first visit, I was completely transformed. I swear I looked like a different person! The attention, care and great price cannot be matched anywhere in this town.  I believe a cutcolor from Kim is reasonably priced given the competition (she smokes them!) and the quality of service she provides. Kim has been my stylist for eight years now and I can't even imagine going to anyone else - it would totally feel like cheating. I have never had a bad haircut or color. So many people have asked me about my hair and several friends and coworkers are now loyal to her as well.Oh and the new Montage is just beautiful, very impressive, with a Merle Norman studio attached to it!  And they sell all the products from Moroccanoil....yummmmmm!

"This is a review I wrote for Tammy back in December 2011 (nothing has changed, my hair still looks and feels amazing):Tammy Lord is maybe the 1 most amazing hairdresser ever and I am hating myself as I write this review since everyone is going to want to go to her after (and I will never get in to see her) but still, she needs to props she deserves!!! I don't really know how she hasn't been reviewed yet by anyone else but I guess I will be the first. Tammy has taken my hair from major BLEH to people think my hair looks amazing 6 months+ after its been done by Tammy. Perfect color, perfect cuts EVERY TIME. I guess what spurned this review after so long(I've been her client for a few years) is that I just had my hair done here in San Diego by someone else and I almost cried when he took the towel off my head. The color was NOT right. He used the bleach for the highlights but totally effed up my low-lights (Tammy, if you are reading this, I'm coming in in January...I need you). They do not match my hair AT ALL. My sister and mom go to Tammy as well. They came down to see me for Thanksgiving last week, took one look at my hair and said...why is it orange You need to go see Tammy ASAP. To top it off, he cut these randoms bits of my hair different odd lengths ""to make it healthy"" so my hair looks all choppy and short in some places and long in others. It's just awful. And if you've seen my profile pic, you'll see my hair and see how beautiful it is thanks only to Tammy (pic was taken in February, 2 months after she did it). So it's true folks. Tammy is a miracle worker. She's fixed my hair before when its been botched by these people here in SD and I'm sure this won't be the last time she'll have to do it. She's also incredibly smart, interesting, funny and will always make you feel better about yourself after sitting in her chair for a few hours. It's like a therapy session + hair therapy session...what could be better And don't even let me forget her head massages...OMG. I gotta stop here because now, Tammy is going to be busier than ever. Love love love you Tammy!UPDATE (1112012): I still go to Tammy even though I don't live in Las Vegas anymore. I have 100% complete faith in her and will never go see anyone else.

"GREAT SHOP!! WHEN YOU'RE IN VEGAS YOU MUST SEE ALICE!  we were visiting and read the great reviews on yelp so decided to give this shop a shot.  The heat, sun and pool had killed my girls hair and since it's vegas she wanted to look hot for a night out .... so we went with a new cut and put some lifecolor back in her hair. This salon is really nice and spacious - they invested some money in the decor. Alice knew exactly what to do with her hair.   Always nice to have your girl turning heads as you walk around town.

When I called the Montage, they said Cindie did brows but she wasn't in, they gave me her cell number and said I could call her directly.

The salon is higher end and quite nice, the staff were friendly and nice, Cindie was there ready for me. The room was very clean and comfortable. Cindie is very experienced, doing permanent makeup since 1991! She drew the perfect brows on me and we got to work immediately! Quick, easy, minimal pain and Cindie was an absolute pleasure! I am so happy with my new brows!!! A+++++

"I went to Theresa for a skin condition on my arms and legs that I have had for years.  The dermatologists prescribed creams that did absolutely nothing.  She knew right away what treatments would help my condition and the best part was I could do them at home myself for very little money.  My arms are now completely healed & my legs are almost cleared.  I am actually able to grow hair again where I was not able to before.  Theresa is professional & very informative.  I got quite an education.  I can't say thank you enough for what she did for me.  I will only trust my skin to her.  Thanks, Theresa

"So many people compliment my lashes.  I have had lash extensions since Feb of this year.  I went and had a new fresh set applied last month. She has great attention to detail and is a professional perfectionist.  I absolutely love my  lashes now more than I ever had.  My makeup routine is quick and simple because I can simply go light and not worry about eyeliners and mascaras.  They last several weeks too!  Her prices for full sets and touchups are extremely reasonable.  I live in N. Phx but its undoubtably worth the trip!  I recommend her to anyone looking to give lash extensions a try.   Be sure to check out her gallery onlineCheck out their website for deals as well!

The place is in the Moda Solons building suitr 107 but don't be surprised its not a suite really just a small room. When I went  in she explained everything as she was doing it an is a really great person, great conversation. She made it all relaxing and I didn't feel a thing.

Her attention to detail with the lashes was impressive and I will be a long time repeat customer due to her excellent service.Also be sure to check in to get an extra 10% off services!

Joanne was amazingly kind, accommodating, and responsive to all of my complicated appointment booking needs (I reside in Flagstaff and wished to make the trip to Surprise just for Theresa's permanent makeup artistry) and Theresa simply has to be the very best in the business! Not only was the procedure for permanent eyeliner and brows discussed thoroughly with me prior to choosing a single color, I was made to feel completely at ease and fully confident in my choice to proceed. As one would expect from a talent like Theresa, the results of my permanent makeup are absolutely perfect and, simply put, stunning. In fact, I was making my way through a local grocery store less than 30 minutes post procedure and was stopped twice in the aisles for compliments on the color of my eyes. I my book, that's a five star review for Forever Young Aesthetics right there!A million thanks are owed to Theresa and Joanne for their phenomenal customer service and the fantastic results! When you can enter a business a customer and leave a friend, you know you've found something truly special.

"Karla is by far the best when it comes to permanent Make-up and caring about people!  Karla fixed my brows, that were gun metal black and too arched, and made them look nice and brown again.  Karla also removed a lipliner I had done in Vegas too by someone else (BIG MISTAKE) but I had not know about Karla at the time; but Karla removed the lipliner that was placed above my natural lip line and saved my face!!!!I would NOT recommend anyone else but Karla and Wake Up in Your Makeup if you are thinking about geting any type of permanent makeup.

"I honestly don't where to even start! My friend and I decided to get our nails done after school so we looked for a Groupon and found Holly's Nail & Spa. We purchased our Groupon's and called to book an appointment for almond acrylic sets. We found pictures of what we wanted and showed our nail technicians, Susan and Holly. They were very polite, patient and made sure we had a mutual understanding of what us the clients were wanting. Throughout the manicures they were very thorough and held conversations with us. I enjoyed conversating with my technician, Holly, she was fun and very energetic while she gave me my manicure. Once she finished shaping my nails and lead me to the washing station I glanced at my nails and my mouth dropped. I have NEVER hady nails look so perfect in my entire life. Each nails was perfectly even, smooth, and the exact shape I wanted (mind you this was before they were polished and designed). Soon after my friend Devon texted me saying ""OMG I'm in love""! Once Holly began polishing she coated each nail multiple times and very evenly. I had asked for glitter on my index finger, thinking it was extra, to my surprise it was not! I am just in shock at how gorgeous my nails look and Holly will be my new nail technician for as along as I live in Arizona. Thank you again Holly and Susan, and I will be returning soon. If you are considering going to visit this nail salon I recommend you stop considering and call to book your appointment as soon as possible, your money will be well spent!

"I had never had permanent makeup done and had lost my brows due to chemo and age. Denise was patient and matched the color I asked for. I was concerned because I'm blonde and didn't want brows that looked too dark or unnatural. I've had nothing but compliments from everyone and love the work she's done. I highly recommend her work.

"Denise did a wonderful job on my eyes. I had the eyeliner on the top and bottom done. It is a tattoo so needless to say it was a little painful. What beauty is painless! I did let my anxiety get the best of me and poor Denise had to stop a million times!

"Denise is very professional and does an exceptional job. I would recommend her to anyone. She takes the time to explain everything and answers all your questions. Would not go anywhere else.

"Denise was very friendly upon meeting. She first had me draw on my eyebrows with a pencil to get an idea of what I want. She then made some suggestions that were very helpful and exactly what I wanted! She seems very knowledgeable and experienced. The procedure didn't take long. She used a numbing cream to help reduce the pain. After she finished, she went over after care. So far, I like the work but I need to wait for it to heal which can take a few weeks to see final results. I would definitely see Denise again and recommend her to anyone wanting cosmetic tattooing!

"I first got permanent brows about 6 or 7 years ago. I was fortunate that the lady I picked to do them for me in Tempe was pretty good. The shape was something I could live with but the color turned reddish brown, not good for my skin tone. I had her touch them up a year later and again, I could live with the result because no brow is going to be knockout amazing, right In a couple of years I got lip and eyeliner done. The lip liner I am totally happy with, the eyeliner was spotty and a bit uneven in places, but eyeliner rocks! Last year I found Denise when she ran a special on eyeliner. She redid mine, evened out the rough spots and recommended that I go darker than what I asked for. She was right and it looks wonderful. I finally decided recently that my brows had faded way too much to be ok, I was forced to fill in with pencil each day, which to me is why I got permanent brows in the first place, so that makeup application wasn't necessary every day, right So I called Denise who happened to be running another special, and set up an appointment to do my brows last Thursday at noon. She had me draw the shape plus bring the pencil so she could be sure to match the shade. When I got home I couldn't stop staring at them in the mirror. The lines were so nice, they looked awesome. Plus all the red tone was gone, none peeking through. Today is Tuesday. I took good care to maintain a light layer of Vaseline and didn't rub. This evening they are done, fully shed and beautiful. I couldn't be happier. They are amazing, the color is perfect and they look so good I won't need to fill with pencil.When I'm ready, I will go back for an eyeliner refresher. Denise gets my business. Thank you, Denise!

"If I could give Denise more than five stars I would. A few days ago I had my eyebrows tattooed. Today they look perfectly normal, shaped beautifully, and completely natural. Denise was very professional and friendly. The building was decorated super cute and it was clean. I will recommend Denise to all my friends.

"I originally called Julianne yesterday (thurs aug 1) to schedule an appointment, and I saw her today at noon. She is located at the district, in green valley. She is room number 9 **inside** of Sola salon behind the cheesecake factory.As soon as I walked into the lobby, she was drawn to me. She was warm, friendly and introduced herself. We went into her personal room, which is glass (she has privacy drapes). She sat me down in a very comfortable recliner, and told me a little about herself before we started to discuss my mistake.....I mean, tattoo.Julianne is certified in micro-pigmentation, which means she knows a lot about skin. She is a member of the SPCP (http:www.spcp.orgthinking-of-getting-a-cosmetic-tattoofind-a-technician).She does tattoo removal with natural saline. The saline removal process is a non-laser ink extraction  alternative, very similar to the regular tattoo process in that it uses similar equipment and procedures.  But instead of pushing ink into the skin, the saline removal system uses a special solution - mostly of sea salt -to create an osmotic condition. As the cells lift due to osmosis, they push the ink  into the scab and out of the skin. Saline tattoo removal generally requires 50% to 75% fewer treatments than laser tattoo removal, and unlike laser removal -- which relies on wavelengths to target  only specific colors -- saline tattoo removal method is effective on all colors of ink and on all areas of the body. (http:dragonflyink.comtattoo-removal)I have been nervous with laser, seeing as how it actually burns skin.She told me that she would work on a few 2 inch sections at a time, so that my body could heal properly and deal with the scabs correctly...about 5 weeks. She would also numb the area as well. Normally, she only does small tattoos (my tattoo is 30 square inches), but she told me she is willing to work with me, and that if I am willing to commit, so is she. At $100 an hour, my husband and I feel that this is a better way then $400 a session laser that will take 7-12 sessions.I can not wait to schedule with her in these next few weeks!She is a true gem personality wise, and I can't wait to work with her. She seems to really care about who she does procedures on, and what she does. I read the filtered review on this place, and it seems very positive.I will do updates!
",1
"Alright, the day has finally came, the day for removal to begin.Julianne is nothing but PROFESSIONAL, I was so impressed by our last visit.The removal starts with her taking a sterile needle, (which she opens in front of me) and scratching it over the tattoo, to allow the pain medicine to seep in.Then, the fun part starts. She takes her tattoo gun, and dips it into a solution of saline. With the pain medicine, I was very comfortable...of course, there were some tender spots (it's just like getting the tattoo all over again.) We are doing two small sections, with two different solutions to see which one works better with my skin, and how I heal with them. We will of course use the one that is most effective. Unlike laser, it is not a ""one size"" fits all approach! She sends me off with a care package, and very detailed instructions on how to treat the wound for proper healing. We have had communication, making sure that I am doing well... I don't even get that from my doctor!Today, is the second day with the wound, and it is sensitive to touch, and some clothing.. like my bra because of it's location. I am excited to see how I heal in the next few weeks!

"Yet another day with Mrs. Julianne....This day was filled with ""once again"" (s), and some new items.((Something New!)) Please note, that she is no longer located in room 9.She has MOVED to room 15.[Sola Salons, The district GVR]The room is larger, and decorated lovely. There is a pin up feel to this room....risque pictures included ! ;)My first session a few months ago was a ""test"" strip, testing two different solutions to see which one worked more effectively with my skin type and the mistake.................I mean, tattoo. **Once again**I am warmly greeted by Julianne. She had ran out to get an ultra soft blanket for my support (and was still on time!)**Once again**Before pulling out utensils, Julianne examines the previously treated spot, addresses my questionsconcerns. **Once again**It is all about ME. My comfort and what would help make our session more productive. Our first session had me on my side, and this time I was on my stomach. Julianne also gets me in the ""mood"" with music.....music that I actually like. No elevator or country music here ! (by my choice, I'm sure if you wanted country, or classical, she would pull up Pandora for you....Which she offered to do for me).How can I not get in the mood of tattoo removal when JayZ and Drake is on!! LOL.((Something new!)) She now has a comfort fishy! Luckily, I used her pinky fishy to have more support for my neckhead, and fishy didn't have to soak up any of my tears. ((something new!)) The recliner is gone. In its' place is a new chair, that reminds me of one at the dentist's office. In a faboosh SNAKE print, of course! **Once again**clean, and sterile tools are open in front of me, with Julianne putting on a fresh pair of gloves. The products she used on me were fresh, she mixed them in front of me...They haven't been sitting around for hours, or days.The anticipation is almost worse than the actual pain. We start with a numbing process, and get to work. Julianne takes my mind off the pain by having great conversation. I don't think there was a thing that we DIDN'T talk about today...haha. Which is awesome. Who wants to sit in silence when you're getting needles dug into you, and salt solution pumped inside you That would be awkward and painful!My pictures are posted. The letters (that have a pinkpurple circle around them) are almost invisible. This is their second treatment. The center looks like a big mass of sunscreen, but that is a salt solution that we decided to leave on. I would rather have a warm, friendly, consistent, thoughtful, professional, quirky longer removal process than to have a quick solution and be treated like some cash cow number. And I'd rather not have my super fair skin burned up by a laser. Well, now that I've confessed my strange love for Julianne.....More updates, and pictures to come!THANKS AGAIN JULIANNE!!!!*****1062014********It has been brought to my attention that Mrs. Julianne has bought a laser and will have it up and running in December ! Saline and laser tattoo removal will be offered! Exciting !

"Julianne is so talented!!!  She has done life changing work on my daughter who is now gleaming with confidence.  Julianne is so kind and very patient, and she definitely stands behind her work.  I am so grateful for her and her talents.

"I went to see Julianne about five months ago to have permanent eyeliner put on. I have tremors and I am no longer able to apply eyeliner. She is the most wonderful,Professional and kind understanding lady I have ever met. She made me feel like a queen for the day. She did such a fantastic job. I have never been so pleased about having anything done with my eyes. It is such a relief not having to worry about putting on eyeliner when my head is shaking so bad. And Julianne really understood that. I would recommend her for any tattoo removal, permanent eyeliner, tattoo eyebrows, and so much more of the things that she is able to do. We played around with make up application and she made me look so wonderful. I would give anything to be as skilled as she is. So if you're going to have anything done, tattoo eyeliner, tattooed eyebrows, make up application, tattoo removal, and so many other services she is the place to go. So if you want to feel beautiful and that you really matter then go see Julianne. Instead of five stars I give her 10. Thank you Julianne for making my eyes look so great. Love you

"I think Julianne is so kind and caring about her clients. I went to see her again yesterday and she did a fantastic job on my eyeliner. I have trouble putting on eyeliner. So it is so wonderful to have permanent eyeliner. I would recommend her to anyone who has special needs with the services that she provides. Such as tattoo removal, permanent eyeliner, and permanent eyebrows. And so many more services. She is now doing permanent hair removal. So I am so excited to begin that service. She makes you feel like you really count. She is the most meticulous person I have ever been to. I would recommend her 100% to anyone who needs services done that she provides.Thank you Julianne for always making me feel special.

"I have been going to Christine for 6 years now. She and her staff are warm, welcoming, and extremely talented. The salon is relaxing refuge full of positive energy, and the conversation matches the haircut (which is always top notch). Because of Christine, Katie and the rest of the crew, I always look forward to haircut day.

"You know how you say, ""I want a big change!"" but then you get in the stylist's chair and you're like, ""I'm looking for a change, but only take about an inch off,"" and then you still want to cry when you leave the salon bc you're hair is too shortI lost 4 inches of hair and got bangs and I only wanted to cry a little bit, when she made the first snip!  I freaking loved my hair.  LOVED.MY.HAIR.  Bangs! Bangs!  And not the kind that you thought would make you look like Zooey Deschanel but instead you look like you are 10 and your mom got your hair cut at Fantastic Sams and never, ever, ever lay right!Bangs!  Like long, sweeping bangs that fell right and made all my friends say, ""I wish I could pull of bangs!""I LOVE THIS PLACE.  They moved to Lawrenceville a few years ago, and I havent been to the new salon yet bc its been that long since I've had my haircut which is so sad.  It's like witch craft, what they do with hair, and I need some magic.I highly recommend this salon.

"Gotta give a big THANKS! to this Walgreens.  I found myself there shoeless with an overheated dog and they had no problem letting me come in with the dog to buy some water for him.  It is rare for a big chain store to be so dog and barefoot friendly!

"5 stars just based on the Estee lauder counter. The girls Lisa and Ann are extremely professional with their customers. For example I get courtesy calls reminding me of special limited offers for face cleanser and serums. One time I received a call from Ann that they just received a special shipment of only a handful of gift sets for the holidays and that they could put one on hold for me. Since this stuff is pricey, the associates make sure that your money is well spent. They even help with the fragrances too. Got several men's fragrancees (Polo red, Aqua Di Gio, John Paul Gultier, CK Euphoria, Dolce and Gabana Sport) and complimentary body wash, duffle bags, and trial bottles too. The Boston Store charge card is also nice because you can save on luxury items that never go on sale like cosmetics and fragrance. So all in all I base the ratings just on the two departments I visit most often. This is not the typical department store that I am used to for clothes or shoes since it caters mostly to older folks but that's ok. I don't go to Boston Store for clothes or shoes. Home decor isn't too bad either. Saw several glass Santas and nativity sets that would look great if only I had more space

"Kevin the massage therapist is great. Listened carefully what I had to say and took care with my shoulder. Amber the receptionist is also great.

"Tiffany is, by far, the best stylist I've ever had.  I recently moved to DC and have let my hair go for 6 months because I knew I'd be back home in Madison around Christmas and could sneak into Ultimate and get my hair done right.When I first started going to Tiffany, I did what every girl does post-break-up.  I sat in her chair and told her I didn't care what she did with my hair but that I needed something different.  She gave me the perfect cut and color.  I was stopped multiple times by strangers asking me where I had gotten my hair cut.  It was stylish and professional - plus, I could just blow dry it into shape, no need to curl or use a straightening iron.Love this place!
",1
"I LOVE Ultimate! A friend referred me to Alyssa and she is who has done my hair for the past two years! She's great and always makes me hair better than I imagined. The salon is nice. Other reviews say they are pricey but you get what you pay for. I get a paraffin dip and neckscalp massage when I get my hair done. I'm not sitting there all day like other places. The front desk is very friendly and I even get mailed coupons for discounted services. I will be going back as long as I'm living in Madison. :)
",1
"Since moving to DC a year and a half ago, I continue returning to Madison frequently to get my hair done by Tiffany.  She's the only one I'll let touch my hair and I always leave feeling like a million bucks!  Not only is she a wonderful stylist, she's become a good friend of mine and I don't think I'm the only client of hers that feels that way.

"My sister and I decided to give our mom a complete ""makeover"" as a gift. I called multiple salons to inquire if they would be able to strip color out of my mom's hair. (She decided to stop coloring her hair and let her hair grow out, so she had greywhite on top and dark brown a few inches down.)Many of the salons said that it could not be done. When I spoke with someone at the Ultimate Spa Salon, they stated that they would be able to lighten the color so it would blend better with her natural hair color. The stylist was very nice, discussed what she was going to be doing.  She put lightener on my mom's hair a few times. I was nervous that it wasn't going to work.  She got a new hairstyle, and when it was all done, she looked FABULOUS!  I was very pleased with how it came out.  It was pricey to have it done, but when it comes to a drastic change, I'd say it's worth it!

"I'm basically an upbeat positive person...but some days I'm not my normal corky self. I arrived at Perry Monge flumoxed and in a bad mood--a special event meant that all nearby lots cost $12 for parking. Spending $12 for parking is spendy for a day in San Francisco...but in Phoenix for an hour Please. I mentioned this to the poised woman at the check-in desk who said that next time I should park in the lot at their building where they validated parking. She then brough out a yummy iced tea for me to sip while filling out the new client form. I went to the bathroom, which featured a delightful scented candle, and then Sandy () brought me to the changing room and then my chair. A surprise: shortly after sitting down in the barber chair a woman brought me over to have my shampoo--and gave me a brief massage first. The massageshampoo woman had a very positive energy to her. Marina cut my hair and, although she was not much of a talker, was upbeat and gave me a great cut. I've been looking for a great place in Phoenix and found it. No one will ever compare to my beloved Cid at Barbarella in San Francisco, but I do have a new favorite salon locally in the Valley of the Sun.

"Perry has been cutting my hair for about 4 to 5 years.  Whenever I walk out of there I cannot believe how my hair looks, and I oftern get complete strangers complimenting my cut.  Perry does a great job of taking my preferences and developing cuts that flatter me. What more can I askThe  massage before the shampoo is standard and more than once I've fallen asleep.  Once a couple years ago, in the late afernoon of a particularly frustrating day at work, they asked if I wanted anything to drink.  I said, only if you have vodka.  Next thing I know, a clear drink on ice shows up...and tasted suspiciously like vodka.  No that's customer service.
",1
"I absolutely love Perry Monge Salon!  I have been going there since 2004 and it has never disappointed.  The entire staff is friendly and makes you feel right at home.  Marina is amazing with hair...I only wish she could style my hair every morning!  The extra perks beyond an amazing hair cut are the chair massage before your wash and the hand massage during your cut!  I spend 75% of my time in Dallas and 25% of my time in Phoenix, but insist on only having my hair cut at Perry Monge!

"There is no doubting that I am an Aveda girl. Being in Phoenix and having plenty of Aveda salons around you would think I'd be beauty-heaven. But when I left Cleveland I was very hesitant to leave my hairdresser so I scheduled my hair appointments around when I'd be flying home. Well, as one could image, that become very expensive, so I finally decided to take a chance with Perry Monage downtown. I'm so glad I did! From the moment I walked in to the stylist, they were spot-on with customer service and they did an amazing job with my cut and color, too! There was a little up-selling me with products which I wasn't use to and I must admit, I did cave but I mean, Aveda, hello Can we say amazing!I'm still in love with Aveda and I'm now in love with Perry Monage.

"Best hair cut in town. Clean facility, friendly staff, and they are always very welcoming. Definately recommend getting your hair cut here...actually, I recommend getting them all cut - HA! (hair cut humor is just awful) If you are in to hair products, they have a great selection on Aveda stuff.

"I love this place! The customer service is second to none. The front desk staff is always friendly and helpful. I have a great hairstylist, and the other services I have received have been wonderful. Even when I am there just on my lunch break to pick up a few things, I am always offered something to drink. Products are recommended, but there is no pressure to make any purchases. It's comfortable, clean, and the staff is always on time. Yay for Perry Monge!!

"I was in the market for a new stylist since mine fled the Phoenix scene in search of cooler weather in Colorado. I went to my Aveda store to pick up some products and there was a stylist from Perry Monge, Marie Luce ( sp) gave me a coupon for 20.00 off so I decided to give it a try.OMG. From the moment I walked in I felt like royalty. I think I was getting the first timeservice but not only did I get one of the best haircuts, a styling, a 5 minute back massage, a very thorough hand massage, a facial ( yep),eyebrow waxing, a make-up refresher and an iced cappuccino. I wound up buying 3 products but I always buy something Aveda when I go so it wasn't a hard sell.I love my new look-my skin looks amazing and the total cost was 122.00 What! I had a 20.00 off coupon but still....It was brilliant marketing. I have found a new stylist and I will be faithful in getting a facial each time I go because it's so worth it. I highly recommend Marie Luce, she is amazing!

"Marina Ochoa. Amazing. 2 months later and I'm still getting compliments on the cut, and how healthy it looks. I've been going there for about 4-5 years, and will continue to do so!Marina will LISTEN to you. Tell her what you want, and she will give you ideas and suggestions. She won't push anything, including products. Though the products she recommends are always topnotch. She won't make you feel like you have to purchase anything. The staff is always very cheerful and happy to assist you with any questions. Tell Marina, Maria sent you :)

"called at 5:15pm.  they closed at 5:30 but told me to come by.  I wish I knew the name of the woman who washed, cut and styled my hair as well as plied me with champagne AND did my makeup.  I am not from Phoenix but if I was I would never go anywher else.

"I have been going to the Perry Monge Salon for about 14 years.  I love this place!!  If you are Latina, have curly hair, and cannot find anyone to cut your hair andor style it because of the curl, this is your place!  Saturdays are busy, but I try to avoid them.  I am lucky, I work downtown so I am able to make an appt. right after work and not have to deal with the craziness of Saturdays.  Being a client for so long, I have tried their spa, waxing services, and of course hair services, and and happy with everything!  I have even recommended this salon to many friends and family, all of whom are still loyal clients.  An added bonus, my husband and I joined the Aveda Pure Privilege program, it took us approx. 4 years of saving our points, but in 2011, we had a 6 night stay in Jamaica!  It was absolutely wonderful.  We stayed at the Caves in Negril complete with complimentary massages.  Since then we have saved another 44,000 points and are looking forward to booking our 3 night stay in Antigua next year when we reach 50,000 points.

"EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE HERE! I've used the pharmacy (drive through at night) and store during the day and both were excellent experiences. By accident I left an item behind in the store after a purchase and the employees, especially the manager and assistant managers, were all VERY helpful in keeping it safe for me until I was able to retrieve it.

"This is the best bike store I've walked into.  Their primary focus is on racing bikes, but (as I'm not a racer) the service stays top notch in much lower price ranges.Got greeted by the staff, and my girlfriend and I got the luxury of absolutely no pressure as we walked around and looked at bikes.  She explained what she was looking for, and the staff explained what they had and what price range she was looking at.  I wound up talking to another person working there, and let them try to find a bike that fit.  (I'm 6'8"", and as I found out, fit pretty well on an XXL Scott 65cm frame.)Anyways, back to my girlfriend's experience.  What impressed me was after they had a bike they thought was a winner, they let her go on a test ride around the neighborhood there.  And then when she came back in two minutes, told her that wasn't ideal, and sent her back out, with instructions to take the second left and try it on a hill.  After she figured out yes, that was the bike, the guy spent at least half an hour fitting the bike to her; he wound up switching out the stem, adding a seat with a little more travel, and getting everything just so.  There was no hurry.  There was no pressure.The amount of interest that the staff showed in getting each person the just-so fit gets five stars; if you want a bike that fits, it's worth it to browse here.And, update: I went out the other day, and asked for a price on a bike costing about 25% of the bike I tooled around on there two weeks ago.  Without batting an eye, and without a hint of bike snobbery, the owner ran off to figure out what it'd cost me.  I talked to him about the differences between a double and triple, and he spent twenty minutes explaining the pros and cons, and gave a strong suggestion on the double.  That said, the price he quoted me was also 10% under the price quoted by another shop on the same exact bike.  I asked for the price of an upgrade to a single part on the new bike, and he quoted me about half the price I expected from doing research on the internet.  Customer-friendly, well priced, super-high-quality bicycles.  A+++.Edit, 4 years later: Glen, Beth, and the rest of the crew here are still there, and still awesome.  My girlfriend is now my wife.  My lowend Trek road bike now has more miles on it.  :-)It's still a much longer drive to get to Big Bang, but for any work on my bike, I'm glad to make the drive.  Friends have terrific luck with Pittsburgh Pro, which is nearer,  and I'll occasionally stop there on a ride; that said, for drop-off-the-bike work, Big Bang is my absolute go-to.

"This is the best experience I've had at a bike store in the Pittsburgh area.  I have been shopping around for a couple months for a new road bike (which was going to be my first road bike ever, meaning that I'm fairly clueless about how to pick one out).  Also, since I'm a student, I don't have particularly deep pockets.At Big Bang, I was greeted basically the moment I walked in the door.  I'm kind of shy when I know that I don't really know what I'm doing, but I wasn't pressured or harassed in any way by the staff.  Even though my price range was pretty low, they still tried their hardest to find a bike that suited my needs, and they found a bike that fitted me perfectly (and gave me an *excellent* deal on the price).  They take a lot of care to make sure you're properly fitted to the bike.Also, this is one of the few bike stores I've been to where test riding is gleefully encouraged, rather than grudgingly allowed.  Definitely it's the only bike store where they'll tell you ""You haven't tried it out enough, go climb up the hill on  it!"" -- they definitely put the emphasis on matching rider with bike, rather than making a quick sale.I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who's looking for a road bike, whether they're a seasoned racer or a neophyte rider like me.

"I wrote this review right after I had bought my bike.  I would like to update to reflect further experiences I've had with BBB.So, first of all, one of the shifters on my bike turned out to be defective (not super-unusual for the Shimano short-reach shifters, also totally not the shop's fault -- these things happen).  Since it was covered under warranty, BBB switched it out for a new set of shifters, at no cost to me.  I had my bike back in a couple days, no muss no fuss.My husband got a used road bike from Craigslist, and we brought it in for a tuneup.  The bike had several things wrong with it, due to a shoddy assembly job, and BBB basically took the entire bike apart and rebuilt it, cleaning it and replacing various worn-out bits.  I can't remember the total cost of this, but it was under $100.I would totally recommend BBB, due to their general awesomeness.  I haven't had any of the tuneup-related woes that other people have had with this shop, even when bringing in a bike that I haven't bought there.

"I created an account just to review this shop, it's that awesome.This is by far the premier shop in all of western PA, and arguably the state. Glenn the shop owner is one of the most knowledgeable men in the U.S. when it comes to cycling.  Having spent time in Europe, and with some of the biggest names in the industry, he truly knows what he's talking about.Furthermore; he's a pleasure to talk to, incredibly friendly and passionate as anything about the sport.  As for bike fitting, this is the only shop I would go to, Glenn's knowledge and background can't be competed with, and he is incredibly thorough.Yes, they equipment is expensive, but that's a result of the quality they carry..not them setting prices high. Cycling is expensive, end of story. If you're looking to pick up your next huffy, go to walmart. If you want a quality bike that is going to fit you, and operate perfectly: go to big bang.

"When you walk out of Big Bang Bikes you know you are buying a bike that fits YOU!  Glenn is amazing and he will help you reach your specific goals!  He has amazing passion and knowledge to make you more efficient and comfortable.  The best bike shop...by far.  Great prices and service.  We live in the north and won't hesitate to make the extra drive for anything bike related.

"This place is the absolute BEST to purchase a bike! I have been searching for a bike for a while now and every place I have gone to have not been NEAR has helpful as Glenn. The one guy in the shop helped pick me a bike for what I needed and Glenn fit me perfectly to the bike. They also helped me with the bike rack on my car and changed my bike saddle for me! Ohhhh and they gave me the best price on the bike and accessories!!!  Wonderful service. Absolutely will go back! ... Can't wait!

"I've got to be honest, I don't think I've ever been as blown away by customer service as I was here. I went in about half an hour before closing, was not rushed at all. I basically just walked in and said I was interested in a road bike but knew very little about them (I'm a MTBr). I was helped by Glenn, who, within two minutes, had me sitting on a bike, measuring me and adjusting things, and explaining the physics behind positioning and angles and the difference between the male and female physique on a road bike. At no point did he try to upsell anything (in fact, he didn't even ask me about a budget). He just gave me a few things to think about before I invest in something new. He was very obviously focused on getting me the product that will give me the most efficiency and power for my needs. So very impressed...this is absolutely where I will be buying my bike.
",1
"If you're in the market for a high quality bike, whether it be road, mountain, racing, or hybrid, go to see Glenn at BBB.  It's very clear that he loves his shop and his job.  I explained my needs and preferences to him and he quickly fitted me with a bike that suited my needs.   I actually bought my Trek 7300 over 3 years ago and I absolutely love it!  He sells only the highest quality bikes and equipment.  Highly recommended.

"Big Bang Bicycles is phenomenal! Amazing selection and service! I live in the San Francisco, Bay Area with plenty of premium bicycle shops available, but I do most of my cycling shopping at Big Bang Bicycles when I visit family in Pittsburgh. This shop carries top gear and has in stock tons of options so you can see, feel and evaluate them first hand to know what's going to give you the best feel and performance. Glenn, the owner, is very knowledgeable, friendly and you can feel his passion for cycling and making sure you get the right product and fit for you.  Even if you're not in the Pittsburgh area but you know what you want -- send your order to Big Bang Bicycles and I'm certain you'll have a great experience. Awesome shop! Thank you Glenn and team!

"Okay these guys are really good guys, they provided free bike tune-ups along the MS 150 route if you guys are familiar with that.

I never get a pretentious d-bag attitude when I come here.

"This is a great little bike shop! I went here looking for a hybrid and tried out a couple of different models. One of the bikes I wanted to try they didn't have assembled in my size yet, but Rob said they would assemble it in my size and have it available for me to test ride either that afternoon or the next day. I went back the next day to try it out, and though I ended up liking the other (less expensive) model better, I thought it was great that he was willing to assemble a bike just so that I could try it out to be sure of my decision. He also threw in a bottle cage and kickstand for free when I bought the bike! They may not have the biggest selection, but this is a really amazing LBS that goes above and beyond for its customers.

"yeah. it's true alright. though it is cramped and messy and the old dude is grumpy, he has a heart of gold and this place is one of the very best. like best on earth. I always seem to go in frustrated and leave happy. this is likely a combination of the fact that I go with a broken bike that leaves fixed and the fact that the cost of fixing is so..reasonable. I recently replaced my brakes and the ones the old guy gave me were missing a screw so he upgraded me to the next nicer ones for free. this guy is really a treasure. and this place is too.

I inherited a bike my dad had purchased in college, and hard a part break, I knew that Kraynick's would be the only place able to help, even though at the time there were still Schwinn ""authorized"" dealers in the area. Here's the exchange: Me: ""I have an old Schwinn three-speed, probably from 1969 or '70, and it has this little washer with a raised part that fits in the groove between the fork and the rear axle. That part broke."" Him: ""A Collegiate or a Speedster"" Me (amazed): ""Speedster."" At which point he turned around to a wall of tiny drawers that seemed to stretch from floor to ceiling and appeared to have no intelligible labeling, pull open a single drawer, and produce the part I needed. It cost something like 30 cents... Places like this pretty much do not exist anymore, the shop is like a museum of bicycle parts (and the upper stories of the building are reportedly just as full). If the recurring rumors of its closing  Mr. Kraynick's retirement are any indication, it may not be here forever. FIND ANY EXCUSE to get here while it's still around!

"Kraynick's Bike Shop is a diamond in the rough... even if the diamond itself seems rough. It's messy sometimes and definitely cramped. But if you can deal with that, it is a great resource for Pittsburgh cyclists. There are six racks in the back where patrons can work on their bikes, and Gerry will sell you the necessary parts at discount rates.Many times I've gone in to fix ""just one quick thing"" and then three hours later I finally leave. It can be intimidating if you don't know much about bike mechanics, but other people there are usually helpful and friendly, and though he doesn't always radiate warmth, Gerry has helped me with a number of issues.In short, a great resource and way to learn a lot and save money if you have the time.

"Some drunk asshole fell into my back tire and completely ruined it. Rather then go to Trek and spend a good $100 for a new tire and the labor I headed to Kraynicks.I spent around 3 hours fixing not just my back tire, but my shoes, shifters, and I even cleaned up my chain and gears. I love that you go in to fix a simple issue but end up spending hours there. You can't help it. Gerry and John are great people and their willing to help you because they just love what they do rather than to just make a profit. I already want to go back. And yes best bike shop in existence is a pretty accurate statement.
",1
"Great spot for weird or obscure parts, general maintenance items, and to  borrow a wrench or two.  Gerry is like a wise eccentric uncle.   I remember going there for my first time in the early 90's and it hasn't changed in almost 20 years.
",1
"Kraynick's is a real gem for Pittsburgh.  This isn't the place to take your high-end carbon frame bike, but Jerry will help you get your commuter, beater, or frame you found trashed in a ditch in the woods back on the road.  (Seriously, there was a guy in there salvaging an old MTB frame he found in a ditch in the woods.)  Be forewarned: he's pretty typical of a lot of old school Pittsburghers: very gruff at first, but actually a nice guy when he warms up to you.I haven't had a bike in ten years and decided out of nowhere to build one around an old frame and a new internal gear hub.  I bought a few high-end components online and the rest from Jerry.  Despite bringing in outside parts, Jerry was still gushing with help, and, after several weeks and 3-4 visits, I'm riding a bike that I built from scratch after going in with no mechanical knowledge of bikes at all.  He doesn't carry new super-high-end components, but the stuff he does carry is solid, and he has every weird bracket or screw or cable guide you can imagine from decades of scrounging parts.  He can help you with any weird setup you want.  (Mine's definitely out-of-the-ordinary.)One warning: this is your standard old Pittsburgh small business, so he doesn't take credit cards.  It's a little annoying considering that you might be spending over $100 on parts and service, but there's an ATM down the block.
",1
"While I was a little skeptical walking into the place, I loved the experience in the end.  EVERYTHING you need, or could possibly ever think of needing is there in the shop, in multiples.  If you don't know what you're looking for, or how to fix it, Gerry will help you.  As will the 6 other bike fanatics who are in the shop working on their own bikes.  The prices can't be beat.  And, while you have to do the work yourself, it's really rewarding to walk out of there with a bike you fixed yourself.  Same repairs at REI or Dick's would have been two to three times as much.  Would definitely go back for more!

"I love this Banana! There are always sales and promotions going on, so there are always bargains to be had. The store is always clean, and the staff is very friendly and knowledgeable about the product.I love that there are three floors to explore, two for women and one for men. The merchandising manager, Dean, has styled the store beautifully. I love looking at the styling on the mannequins to get ideas for outfits.The shoes have drastically improved over the years, and I absolutely love the Abby flats. They are extremely comfortable while still being stylish. They get new colors seasonally, which makes me a happy girl!

"As a former BR employee, I'm very hard on my shopping experiences at Banana Republic as a customer. However, I had a great time shopping here with my husband on Saturday! We shopped on all 3 floors and received multiple offers for assistance. My husband was the focus of the trip, and the guys on the men's floor were very helpful. They asked what we were shopping for, guided us in the right direction, and set up a fitting room for him while we were still browsing. Next time I needwant to shop at Banana, this will definitely be the store that I head to!

"I consider Dicks to be by far the best sporting good store in Charlotte or the surrounding areas. It has pretty much everything from basketball equipment to under armor clothing. They also carry things like exercise equipment, guns, heart monitors, weight lifting gear, etc, etc.They even have a climbing wall (at least the one at South Park mall does).

"Just went to Don's the other day to get my tennis racket re-strung.  The store was pretty busy (right after work - 5ish), but Don somehow was still able to provide personal service as he always does.You pretty much can get everything Tennis in this store, and if Don doesn't have it, he will most likely order it for you if you want to wait for it.You can either drop your rackets off and come back later to pick them up - most of the time I only have one to string and I just wait for it while browsing at the new products, maybe hitting some with the makeshift  hitting cage that Don has in the back of the store.Don is pretty old school so no creditdebit cards... just cash or check.  I always make sure I make a pit stop at the ATM before I go and see Don.
",1
"I love Don's!  Don is one of the most charismatic individuals you'll meet, and he loves tennis!  They have everything from rackets to balls to ball machines to wrist bands to novelty items to grips and dampeners...the list goes on!The best part about this place  THEY'LL HAVE YOUR RACKET STRUNG THE SAME DAY!!! I've been coming here ever since!  His stringers are pretty good, too, so don't go to Dick's or other sporting goods stores.  Go to Don's.

"I've bought shoes, a sweet 3-compartment insulated Head bag, grip, and had my rackets restrung there several times. Always satisfied by their professionalism, speed, and courtesy. There's no shoddy salesman tactics, no unkept promises about restringing (done same day or next), and I always leave happy.I highly recommend Don's to all tennis players, new and experienced.Thanks Don's

"I am in the market for an entry-level shotgun for skeet and field birds.  Heard about this place and thought I would give it a try after work yesterday.  I arrived 10 minutes before closing (5:50pm) and was greeted enthusiastically when I walked in.  I told the greeter that I was new to the store and to firearms in general.  After a quick discussion  about what I was looking for, he immediately introduced me to an extraordinarily knowledgeable associate.  By the way, at 5:50pm on a monday, this place was PACKED.  But there seemed to be 30 or more associates working, so there was no waiting.  Since I was new to skeet shooting, my person helped me look at different fits and helped me with some shouldering and sighting techniques.  The prices seem in-line with what you would find anywhere else.  I was not ready to buy that day, but I am confident I will buy there when the time is right!

"Lemme be clear.  I don't own a gun.  I'm not into shooting guns, or particularly even holding one.  (My hands shake and I start feeling nauseous.) But I gotta say, after being in a few different gun shops for work...this place really takes the cake.  I agree with Dave S.  that Hyatt is a very highly respected shop.  It's in fact one of the top 10 largest in volume gun dealers in the entire country.  (One of the store employees even printed out the article to show me.) You'll see the vast selection of firearms on the walls, in the cases...and all the employees I talked to know their stuff inside and out.  I was told the story behind machine guns, and the history behind certain handguns.  The place is almost ALWAYS packed (even on Black Friday...when they don't offer any discountssales) and what I admire is how the salespeople take their time with each customer no matter how busy it is.  The fact the customers all wait patiently and don't get mad...now that's loyalty.

"I've started attending a defensive pistol shooting club and one of my friends has lent me a gun to use, but I need some of the accessories to go with it. A proper holster, some speed loaders, a cleaning kit, a trigger lock and a bunch of 'dummy' bullets so that I can safely practice reloading. I headed to Hyatt because they have everything!The staff is very helpful and were more than patient to point out where stuff was in the large shop and provide expert recommendations. They have a great selection of all of the stuff I wanted, but I think that the prices were quite high. If you are buying something that can ship in the mail (i.e., not a gun or live rounds), then you'll want to get it from eBay or one of the sporting supply shops online. You'll save a ton.
",1
"Great selection and don't be fooled by the prices because they haggle and you can get a very competitive deal there. If you don't like to haggle then check out their website for their online deals. That is where you find the usual rock-bottom pricing for the firearms they carry. I'm like a kid in a candy store when I go to Hyatt's. It's located in the hood but don't let that stop you. Once inside you will feel very safe as every employee is carrying heat! Don't have a gun Go there! Don't want a gun Good, it will be easy to take your food when the zombie apocalypse happens.

"Alexis below posted about not needing a gun and gave the store a three star rating.   Sorry sweetheart.  YOU DO need a gun and here's why. The day  you need one you may not have one.  Then what I teach firearms and gun safety classes and have had many women lately telling me why they decided to sign up and get a concealed carry permit.  They also didn't think they needed a gun until they were assaulted.   Women are looked on as victims by any perp who wants to control or harm them.  A gun is an equalizer.  You may never use a  gun for self defense but there might come a day when you need one you won't have one.  Consider the woman at Luby's cafeteria and whom on the ONE day she didn't have one, she lost both her parents due to leaving her gun at home.  Consider the lying hypocrite Gabby Giffords who was shot in the head. She maybe would have been able to save herself and others.  Consider the kids at Columbine if only ONE teacher had a gun.  Consider the Washington Navy yard.   Consider Amanda Collins who recently testified in Colorado about being denied the right to carry on campus and ended up being raped.  Don't think for a moment you don't need one because you live in Dilworth.  There are still robberies, assaults, etc that occur there.  And please, don't blame the gun store or its employees for suggesting a common sense thought.  You may come to regret doing so in the future.

"My shotgun (870 express) was having trouble getting the last shell to chamber properly.  I took it in and on the spot they identified the problem (worn out spring) and had the replacement part in stock.  For $10 and 20 min of my time my gun is working properly now.  Very happy with my experience with Hyatt and I will return.

"Hyatt Gun Shop should be a lesson to every other business on Earth about customer service.  Every single employee is helpful and friendly.  There's none of the elitist attitude that is typical of many gun stores.  They're knowledgeable but don't make you feel like a moron.  On a practical note, I've purchased two firearms here and in both cases prices were better on their online store.  You're probably best off buying what you want (if you already know what you want) online, then picking it up in store.  My most recent purchase was this way, and I payed about $100 less online than the price tag said when the guy behind the counter handed it to me.  Granted I've only bought two guns here, but I suspect such will be the case more often than not.Ammo prices reflect the free market.  All the ammo I've bought here has been on par with gunbroker.com (I checked on my phone before buying), which I think is the best indicator of market conditions.  People complaining about the prices obviously don't understand supply and demand.  The demand right now is significantly higher than supply.  There are two ways a business can react to that.  1) They can take the approach that Walmart has and restrict how many boxes each customer can purchase per day (which still leads to shortages as we have seen), or 2) They can raise the price which Hyatt and most others have done, reasonably in my opinion.  Yes, prices are high and that sucks, but with this approach it is still available if you are willing to pay.  Notice how Hyatt has plenty of selection, anything you want from what I saw.  It's not Hyatt's fault that the demand is so high right now (you have the government to thank for that).I've never used their gunsmithing services, so I can't speak to them.I'll be taking some classes with them soon, and given the impressive backgrounds of the guys teaching them, I suspect they will be awesome.This is a great, great store and I highly recommend it.
",1
"Hyatt's has two extremely strong reasons why you should shop there: Selection and Service.   They have the best selection of firearms, east of the Mississippi river.   And the level of service is unmatched.   There are several ""experienced"" gunsmiths on duty every day and if you need something fixed, it can usually be done while you wait.  The staff knows firearms and won't BS you.  The prices are higher than online, however they will accept a reasonable offer.   And if you are not happy, they will make it right.

"I just ordered a knife from their online store.  It turns out their picture was wrong and I got the wrong blade.

"Though Jessie Brown's isn't in the most accessible or likely location, it is easily one of my favorite places to buy gear and apparel. I've been coming here for the past couple of years and have always found items that were difficult to come by, deals that couldn't be resisted and always helpful staff. Though some of the gentlemen tend to have a bit of an attitude, they are always willing to help you find what you're looking for. The layout and decor is really welcoming and has a great feel. These guys have a great selection from different brands. North Face, Arcteryx, Patagonia, Marmot, and some others. I also really dig that they have a good selection of climbing shoes and gear. Their shoe selection is always packed with all different levels of outdoor need. I've never purchased one from these guys, but they have a killer selection of knives, too. In the past couple of years I've purchased plenty of MSR camp stove canisters from these guys. They always have a plethora. Also picked up a nice Thermarest from here. Most recently, my wife and I were looking for a nice mid-layer jacket for the winter for her. We checked out a few different options in the women's section and ended up scoring a great deal on a hooded zip from Patagonia. It was on crazy sale, too. Don't remember exactly how much we ended up paying, but I know it was close to 60% off from the previous year. If I'm ever looking for something particular, Jessie Brown's always has it or at least something comparable. Love coming to this local shop!

"McMullans is awesome. I really like everything about this place. The staff is very friendly. The food is great. The Beer selection is good, with alot of imports as well as my favorite Miller Lite...:) They make fun of me for ordering Miller Lite in an Irish pub, but I get a Guinness from time to time...to mix it up.  Tuesday night pub trivia is alot of fun. This is my favorite Irish pub in town, plus I can avoid the whole strip to get to it. Too many pubs are in the hotels....McMullans is a much better option.

"If you are looking for a place to meet up with friends, then run, don't walk, to McMullan's Irish Pub. Maybe I was high from winning $50 on bingo earlier that night (HUGE winnings from someone who usually gambles about $1 per Vegas trip, on penny slots no less), but I was really taken with this little gem of a place. It's such a well-hidden secret that I'm guessing the only the locals go here, but once you step inside, you will be transported to the Emerald Isle. The pub is run by an Irish gent, and hey, my waitress was Irish too, so there are some authenticity points. I played a show on this particular evening and the crowd was enthusiastic, polite, and focused on the music. (I guess my expectations were that of playing to a bunch of rowdy footballers (so maybe the pub is not THAT authentic). I sold some cds, met some new fans, and sat back to watch the headlining band Darby O'Gill and the Little People. Things got particularly raunchy when they covered ""Baby It's Cold Outside"". I mean, hey, they also play a song called ""Got So Drunk I Crapped Myself"" and have an album called ""Christmas Songs for drunken Athiests"" , so you kind of know what you're in for. Darby O'Gill is the house band...make sure you get there on a Wednesday night to check them out. What to order: Guiness, a Veggie Burger, and Mashed Potatoes (w a sprig of Rosemary).

"This is my four day review of McMullan's Irish Pub. Just to qualify, I flew from Orlando Florida to Las Vegas just to spend four days in this specific Irish Pub. I may be a bit biased.The pub has three distinct sections. At one end is a bar with video poker machines. These are the multi-denominational multi game machines so you have choices. The bar also has a lot of promotions such as a free spin for prizes for every four of a kind you hit. Smoking is permitted in this room - picture old vegas and you get the picture. The middle section is more like a traditional Irish Pub - no gaming and lots of private seating for meals. Of course the Guinness is a proper poor - no sense reviewing an Irish pub that can't do that. The back is another bar that is mostly for private events and the like. It's got a full bar and plenty of room for a decent get together.The Shepherd's Pie is wonderful as is the Farmhouse Irish Breakfast. (Before you ask - white and black pudding is sausage) The service is great and personable 24 hours a day.We got in at 1:30am Christmas Morning and headed to McMullan's right after checking into the hotel. A night cap of a couple of Guinness while we watched the marathon of A Christmas Story on TV. After catching a few winks we were back again for Christmas breakfast of a few more Guinness and Corned Beef Hash and Eggs - wonderful.We repeated this similar pattern until the 27th when we came back for a private party. The service for our party was fantastic! My wife made all of the arrangements and said that Brian McMullan was wonderful to work with.All in All I'm pretty stingy with my five star reviews. This place is definately worth every star.

"this is the first time I've been in an Irish pub or have had Irish food...and i absolutely love it..we weren't planning on having dinner here..we just saw that there was not wait for a table...so we stepped in....i'm not a huge beer drinker but my sisters are..and they loved it...our waiter even had a thick irish accent..so freaking adorable...but the food was absolutely fabulous...i had the braised beef and my sisters had the pork tenderloin....we basically licked the plate...this will definitely be one of the ""have to go to"" places in vegas

"In my humble and somewhat besotted opinion the McMullan family run the single best Irish pub in Las Vegas.  Unlike the vast majority of bars in town, this is not a corporate operation run by MBAs from afar.  Instead, the eponymous McMullans are there every day.  Furthermore, they are extremely involved in the community.  Their ""St. Baldrick's"" charity drive raises donations in six figures for children with cancer every year.  McMullan's Pub features all the beverages that you would expect in an Irish joint with the food being a definite step above usual bar fare. (I'm partial to the fish & chips, myself.)  However, the social experience, good music and the ""craic"" is what you go for here and you get a full heaping serving of it on every visit.

"We recently had our wedding reception in the private room at McMullan's.  It was outstanding.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  The food was delicious.  Best of all, the prices were soooo reasonable.  Our budget was tiny but we were able to have a full dinner including an open bar for our guests!Brian, the owner, stopped in to make sure that our party was going well and that everything was to our liking.I picked McMullan's off Yelp and I'm sooo glad we did.They went out of their way to make sure that everything was perfect, including creating a makeshift cake stand for my wedding cake.We had the irish sausage rolls which were phenomenal, as well as stuffed mushrooms, chicken pot pie and the fish and chips.  HIGHLY recommend the fish and chips.My only complaint was that the main entrees weren't served at the same time so people gobbled up the fish and chips in 2 seconds and some people had to wait 10 minutes before the next entree came out.  That could have been timed a little better so that everyone could have gotten some of everything instead of it being staggered so much.All in all though, I highly highly highly recommend McMullan's.

"Shepards pie was amazing.  Fish & Chips are pure money and definately start with the warm curry and chips.  Our waitress was Irish which really added to the ambiance.  The only caution I give you is that the Guinness is as close to fresh as I have tasted this side of the Atlantic, and they go down very easy.  A few nights they have live authentic Irish folk music.  We went twice in the 4 days we were in Vegas.

"Had a wonderfully positive experience this evening. I ordered the Irish onion soup, along with the buffalo sliders. The homemade potato chips are flipping amazing!! So flavorful.

"Nice little Irish pub in Karlsruhe, where you can find whichever Anglophiles and English-speakers aren't occupying the stools of the Bray Head (t'other Irish pub, near Durlacher Tor).Scruffy's has gorgeous dark wood everything, from barstools to ceiling beams, English-speaking bartenders and British beers on tap, and some truly fun music nights with performances from various local bands. I've had a really nice time every time I've been there.

"I've been to McCarold's several times and will definitely be back several times more. They have a great beer and scotch selection  and the atmosphere is always friendly and chill.Their kitchen also makes great pub food: make sure you try their onion rings! They have TVs, but they're on only when the Habs are playing, which is great (I typically dislike TVs at bars).Only drawback is that you need to remember it is cash only.

"Enjoy coming here to watch a game of football or basketball. They have football food specials. There happy hour is half off on pizzas and drinks. If you like a Ruben try the Sean Patrick's signature pizza. Amazing. Also try the Sean Patrick's chips, it's their take on Nachos. All their burgers are well cooked and have awesome flavor. They opened up a new cigar lounge next to the pool table and shuffle board. Its the only PT's bar with a cigar lounge. It's has comfortable seating, two big screen tvs, and 3 humidors filled with cigars. Gets busy during a football game so come early to grab seating in there.Will always recommend Sean Patricks.

"Simply the most unique night life experience that Charlotte has to offer.If you don't like 80's music, or similarly, don't have any sense of humor or humility, this place isn't for you.  There are dozens of meat market dance clubs available in the Uptown area.  However, if you're looking for a place to get drunk and dance to Micheal Jackson hits, or sip a beer and watch replays from 80's dunk competitions, this place is going to thrill you.  Most important, the vibe here is unlike any dance club I've been to.  You're far more likely to see a Sid Vicious look-alike or a break dancing session form in the middle of the floor than you are to see a shoving match or a fight break out.  80's music has a way of draining the aggression from testosterone pumped drunkards.  And that provides for the most enjoyable dancing experience I've had in Charlotte.Everyone looks ridiculous when they dance to 80's music.  So if you're accustomed (like I am) of looking ridiculous when you dance, you'll love The Breakfast Club.

"Terrific lunch spot!  Their cubano sandwiches are excellent...and always go with the fries...skinny, perfectly made fries.  Their Mojitos and Caipirinhas are the very best in town...dinner seemed a bit overpriced, but the food is still excellent.  The other nice part of Latorres is that its in the heart of downtown, so plan a nice dinner or happy hour before heading out to hit some more classic bars, pubs or clubs in Charlotte.

"Yum yum yum!!! LaTorre's is one of my favorite lunch spots and I'd highly recommend it to anyone who hasn't been!  My personal fave is the Pollo Chipotle sandwich with skinny fries.  Their food is amazing and the prices aren't too bad either.I have a slight issue with LaTorre's and here it is:  Once upon a time, I asked for the Cubano sandwich but with NO mustard.  Well, Mr. Waiter kindly informed me that their sandwiches are pre-made and they are unable to alter them in any way.  Hmm...pre-made hot sandwiches that are deliciously devine  I'm a skeptic.  After asking around, I found an inside source that said that their sandwiches are NOT pre-made but the managerschefs say that so that they don't get overwhelmed with nit-picky custom orders by my fellow corporate cube monkeys during the lunch rush.  My point:  the next time you want your Cubano with no mustard or extra sauce, don't believe the hype and make them customize it for you!  By the way, my spy happens to be an employee so I know it's true.  All in all, this place is great.

"The food is good, but to me, the desserts are what really make Latorre's special. They do this crazy thing with burned sugar that is magical.They have great lunch specials. It's a little pricey for just me, but it's just right for a business lunch with a client. It makes you look smart and sassy and quirky and fun.There's lots of vegetarian options, which is always a good thing. Everything is presented beautifully, which is always fun. Some of the food seems almost too pretty to eat. Salsa night is also a good time. The crowd is relaxed and willing to teach a dorky newbie like myself. I've honestly never had a bad time here, night or day. Charlotte needs more places with so much character.

"My favorite venue in CU.Affordable tickets.Excellent sound.Easy access to drinking with the bar wrapped around the ""center"" wall. And cheap drinks.Having been to venues all over the Midwest, I always find myself wanting to be at the Highdive for a show.  Especially considering a show or tour that would sell-out in Chicago might just reach capacity down in Champaign.How I miss it.

"I've never been here for a show...well, let me clarify.I used to come here tons as an undergrad for various Asian parties, and I still come here most times I've visited as an undergrad.  Things usually devolve into a shit show.Which, honestly, is a good thing, and it's what I'm shooting for when I want to forget about the real world for a weekend.  Sure, it's off campus, but it does have a giant dance floorstage and some awesome people behind the bar. Last time I was here I just kept asking for either A) something awesome or B) something alcoholic.  Never was disappointed once.If anyone you know is planning a party at the HD, be sure to clear your schedule and hit it up. You won't regret it (and you might not remember it).

"My and my main yelper came from Indianapolis to watch Corb Lund play at The Highdive.  It's an intimate concert venuebar, and we had a great time.  Parking was a breeze, we found plenty of spaces on a Saturday night right in front of the venue.If you're coming to a show, get there early to snag seating.  We found great seats up in balcony, which had it's own bar.  Were the bar stools and benches comfortable  Hell no.  Not at all, but the awesome drink prices made up for the sore buns.  Maybe it's because I'm used to paying upwards of $8 for a mixed drink, but $4.50 Wild Turkey mixers made for a great night!  Service was quick, and I never had to wait around at the bar to get a drink which was nice.All in all, a great place to grab a cheap drink and listen to some live music.

"Folks, this is your quintessential small town concert venue.  Great prices, great service, great music.  I came from way out of town for an act that I couldn't pass up: the Corb Lund Band.  Canadian Honky-Tonk at its finest!  What I like most was the vibes - this place has character.  You can tell the building is old, but from what it looks like, it is in great condition.  The mood lighting is red and dim and the decor has a 60s retro-modern twist.  I like it.  If it's open, try to grab a seat on the upstairs balcony, especially if seats are limited down below.  The view and sound is fantastic.Ticket prices are right on the mark - most shows that I saw are under $20, most well below that.  Corb was $15, and from the performance we got, I'd say it was well worth it.  What also blew me away was the drink prices, I got an above rail whiskey mixer for under $5.  Maybe I'm not used to small town prices, but this was an unexpected surprise.All towns would be so lucky to have a music venue like The Highdive.  I have to agree with Jess S. on her review; there are not many places like this in the Midwest, and surely not in Indy.  Keep booking the gigs, Highdive, I'll keep ordering Wild Turkey and Ginger Ales.

"This bar is pure vintage.  Chester Street is where my club life began.  I spent the good majority of my nights (between the ages of 19 - 22) at Chester Street.  It is still my all-time favorite club to this day as far as atmosphere, music, and engineering.  The dance floor is massive with a giant mirror in the back.  There are speakers to dance upon (or used to be), which is an added bonus.  The bars are offset from the dance floor, which alleviates any added congestion (like I see too frequently at the STL bars).  It was extremely economical at the time - I think cover was maybe $2 on the hoppin' nights, and you could easily drink yourself stupid for $20-30.  It was a hell of a lot of fun, and I am in the process of actually planning a trip back soon....long over due.  CU is a fun town period.  C Street is a nice little gem snug in the middle of the city where people can be themselves & dance the night away to the best clubhouse beats.

"What is this magical place you call C Street I used to be afraid of this place as a closed-minded junior. ""It's too far, I won't like the crowd"" I told myself (read: I'm a straight male). But I gave it a shot one day and wow. C Street has the best DJ's and dance floor onnear campus. You can truly dance like a dying flounder and it's totally acceptable (at least late enough in the night). From what I hear from my friends who are girls, they really enjoy it because there aren't guys constantly trying to dry hump them into oblivion. If you want to let loose and get a good leg workout, go to C Street with a group of friends and let the music take control.ps. Yeah, there are still the creepers who hang at the bar and there is typically cover on the weekends, but it is still exponentially better than any other dance bar in CU.

"The first time I went to Karamba's it was for Pride. I went for after hours and it was amazing! I paid my $5 cover fee and went into what looked like an industrial style bar. There were tables being hung from the celing and there were also a backdoor to the outside patio as well as a the ladies restroom. When we went deeper into the club, the blue hued bar gave way to the deep red dance floor. There were tables for dancing on as well as a plush looking chill section. The dance floor was PACKED with men grinding up on men, with women griding up on women and the ocassional straight couple peppered into the crowd as well as a few large groups of women dancing together. Oddly enough there's often a lot of straight women who go there with their bffs so they can dance in peace. There's some chairs and more hanging tables surrounding the dance floor. Then there's the outside patio... there's a few water foutains and a ton of patio chairs, benches and tables. Sometimes it feels like the patio is where the real party is at! Since that weekend, I've been a regular there. I'm sure if you venture there for afterhours some Friday or Saturday night you'll see yours truely tearing it up on the dance floor to some of the hottest hip-hop and reggeton around! If you do, pull me away from my friends and say hi! Hope to see ya'll there!

"GREAT music and tons of fun! LOVE the music!! Fridays is mainly for ""cheros"" akaguys that wear pointy boots with matching belts as they play that kind of music. Notreally my thing but can be fun if you got your buzz going. Saturdays is hip hop,reggaeton, and house music which is the main day it gets POPIN!  After 2 it turns 18and over-never really stayed after 2am so don't know how that it. NOTE: Karambas is not a place to go looking for guys or a dress to impress kind ofplace.  It kind of reminds me of a club I used to go to in Juarez except with alot moreeye candy.  The atmosphere is very fun and people don't really go there to mingle itsmore of a place to with your friends and have a good time without having to impressanyone.  From experience usually the people who don't like going here are the people who are looking for someone else or sad to say ugly lol not to be rude but its true.Bathrooms: Yea they're kinda small but um im there to party... if your worried about thebathrooms LMAO please don't go out or maybe drag a urinal with you.  Prices: People say their over priced but honestly i thought they were cheap... if yourhard up for cash look extra sexy so a cute Latino will buy your drinks for u duh!

"It doesn't matter what anybody says about dance night clubs, you have to see for yourself because this club is absolutely incredible they have an amazing sound system and laser light, this is definitely where I would want to be on the weekend if I'm looking for a dance club. This club is so good it has received the best of Phoenix Award several years in a roll, none of the Latino dance clubs have survived only this club because the owner knows what he's doing and provides great music and entertainment you have to go stop in and see this place if you're looking for a Latino club this is really the only place in Arizona to go.  Also the club has a food taco stand outside which is good and also an amazing outdoor patio that's absolutely beautiful it also has there are areas in the club that are sort of tucked away where you can sit with friends and drink and have a really great time. I am LMAO at all these little young tweakers who are posting bad reviews because they had a bad time give me break they have no clue what a really good dance club is all about, and their one time bad experience has nothing to do with the quality of a club. Maybe if they weren't so high they could have enjoyed the club lol.

"I am a bit partial to this bar... Our Band (Screaming Ant) plays there all the time. The bar it'self  has been around along time and shows it's age... But what's inside are the nicest folks I ever ran across in my life...  It has pool, Large tv's for Sport games! Live Music!The entertainment draws from some of the best rock  bands in the valley and brings some good ole rock and roll that you you just don't find anywhere else!Now,  besides the playing there I have no relations with anyone in the place, and all I know is that when I ask the owner if I could use the bar for an event to raise money for my sister, who has been diagnosed with cancer. With out a blink of an he said yes and they have been great help at helping me organize the event.The bar has a huge parking lot and easy access!The Bartender and waitresses or really on their game.  I remembered as I left the place that I was really happy and I wanted to go back. When we get Gigs there our band get's excited that is because the crowds are fun and it seems like we make new friends everything we play.

"Bring your student ID for discounts.Instead of paying 92 bucks at Fred Astaire, this is a cheap alternate cheap option.Of course its not as technical and personal as Fred Astaire, but I'm saying $ value-wise.There are beginner group lessons (I think it was every Friday 7 PM its been a while...),followed by intermediate group lessons.I think I paid around 10 bucks or below.Then the floor is open for all sorts of dances.Great way to have fun, practice, and learn new stuff.There are refreshments too, which is awesome : )

"I have taken several group lessons on Tuesday evenings for West Coast Swing. Instructor Robert Campos is one of the best WCS instructors in the valley. His instruction is clear and he demonstrates great ability at handling large crowds. His classes are very popular so expect large crowds. Getting personal attention can be problematic but fortunately Robert has an assistant to help people. Partners are rotated often so expect to meet lots of other people who love to dance. There is a meat market aspect to these large group classes but I always enjoy the opportunities to meet beautiful ladies. After rotating to dozens of partners it's easy to break the ice to get them onto the dance floor.After most of the group lessons Paragon keeps the floor open for several hours. The music and dancing is always good. I like the dance afterwards to practice what I learned in the group lesson.  Friday night is the best ballroom party in the valley. They start by giving a group lesson in a different ballroom style every week. The lessons are excellent quality. Once the lessons are over the large floor is devoted to ballroom and the smaller one to West Coast Swing. Snacks are served and dances last until midnight. The East Valley is very lucky to have a studio like Paragon. Sometimes I feel I spend more time there than I do at home!

"I came here for the first time and didn't know what to expect. It turned out to be a lot of fun! First, (we went on a Friday) it's $7 cash at the door to get in. At 7:30 the dance lesson began....or was supposed to (it started more around 7:45) The lesson of the night was West Coast swing. Apparently they teach different genres of dance every week, you need to check their website to see what they are offering for that week. They split off the beginners from the intermediateadvance dancers. Us beginners were put in a smaller dance room studio (to my releif, as I have never danced West Coast Swing, and was nervous to be in front of advanced students...)After an hour of class (which goes by very fast!) they have an open dance floor until midnight. Most of the people there are people who simply love dance. They switch up the music to a different genre for every song, i.e. waltz, foxtrot, salsa, rumba, swing...etc. Even if you are not a great dancer, or only know one genre of dance, it's certainly fun to watch everyone! There are some really good pros and amateurs, no one really cares what you look like out there, everyone is just there to dance! (There were people there of many age groups as well....from early 20's to 60's or 70's!)I love that you can just drop in for a class. No sign up or commitment necessary! I'm looking forward to dropping in again soon!

"This place was DELICIOUS!!  My parents saw a recommendation to visit this place from Rick Sebak's ""25 Things I Like About Pittsburgh"" and he's usually pretty accurate.  His recommendations were to try the Reuben, Fish Sandwich and Open-Faced Steak Sandwich.  We went early afternoon for a late lunch today (a Saturday) and were seated right away.  The staff is extremely friendly.  My Mom & I each had the fish sandwich, while my Dad & Brother had a Reuben sandwich.  The fish was very good, but the Reuben was to die for!  Both dishes were massive, and could very easily be shared between two people.  On top of being extremely large portions, it was incredibly affordable.  The giant fish sandwich was $8 and the giant Reuben was $7.50.  Our drinks were always filled and we were checked on several times during the meal.  We will definitely be back!!!  Oh and a bit of advice ahead of time - they take CASH ONLY.  So come prepared, but I'm pretty sure I saw an ATM there as well.  And I do believe they are closed on Sundays & Mondays.

"This place should have a lot more reviews - but I'm glad it doesn't, they don't need to get any busier.Its been there ages, and looks it. If you're all about ambiance, don't bother. If you pretend you're in a movie set in Pittsburgh 30 years ago it works pretty well. The service is sometimes hit or miss. Most of girls are good, one is very slow, one is amazing. They are all friendly and usually a few different people will check in to make sure that you're happy. Everything is made fresh so be prepared that nothing comes flying out of that kitchen - busy times it can take a good while to get food. The food is AWESOME! Worth any little complaints I might think up before it gets there. Once its on the table, I forget them all.-Fish Sandwiich-Salmon (huge and delicious)-Flounder-Shrimp a few ways (""Norfolk"" style is oily for my taste, and I never had it growing up in Norfolk.)-Hawkins St Special-Prime Rib (sized for two, watch it)The prices are low, the portions are large, and just about everything on the menu  is delicious. I'm not one to pick a place because they give you a lot of food, but if you like a good value and don't want to compromise on taste, this place is a gem.

"After a morning of Thrift Store hunting, a friend and I were thinking of lunch, and he suggested Emil's after he'd seen Chris Sebak do a bit on it and had tried it a time or two before, and I had not. He said they had a decent Reuben, but to be prepared to step back in time.Well, seeing as how I'm kind of addicted to late 40's and early 50's, and the whole Rat Pack scene, stepping back in time is a welcomed change in da burgh...as long as it doesn't involve 1979, which I can see all around me every day.And yet another shot at finding a decent Reuben in da burgh...well, that's like hunting the Holy Grail. So looking under one more bush certainly wouldn't hurt.So off we go right at lunchtime in the middle of...where exactly were we At first I thought we were lost, driving around a handful of very rather dismal looking blocks in what looked like a neighborhood that had been blighted by the building of a highway. And then...AHA! Here it is! And yep, there it was. This little unassuming building with an add-on entrance with what looked like a very old hand painted sign stating quite simply 'Emil's. We walked in the front door, and entered another world. Another time, and another place. Oh, and any Big BurritoSousa foodies might as well stop reading now. I wouldn't want to see you walk in, roll your eyes and say 'Reaaaaaalllly'This is about as old world barloungerestaurant as it gets. Plain, with a dark wood bar on one side, plain white walls with no yinzer pics, good sturdy chairs and actual white linens on the tables. This is the kind of neighborhood dive that I could see Frank and Dino pulling a few tables together for some poker, a fish sammich, and some cheap scotch. And THAT is exactly what I love.Oh...but good food counts too. We each had a Reuben, and my friend had a side of fries. The Reubens were decent, but not NY awesome. A little too thick on the bread, but overall, tasty and definitely filling. Not too skimpy on the meat. I seriously CRAVE a true, good NY Reuben, but since I can't afford to travel right now, what I find in da burgh will have to do. But as we sat and ate, burgers came out to an adjoining table. Those were some big thick burgers. A steak went past for the table behind us. That was HUGE! And when we asked about it, the waitress said 'Yeah, it's huge and really good, and he only charges $12.99 for it, ain't that nuts' Another table of five came in, and wham. Fish sandwiches PILED with breaded fish that looked amazing. Yeah, I want that, that, that and THAT!My friend also mentioned that they have a Chicken Parm special one day of the week that is only served UNTIL 4 pm, and that it is fantastic. If only I could GET there on that week day before 4...The waitress did a good job, especially since there was quite a growing crowd at lunchtime on a Saturday, and only one of her. She kept up and was very friendly. They only have Pepsi products, so I had a brewed iced tea, which was very fresh, and she did pop by to ask about refills as often as she could. As the lunch hour went on, they were getting busy.Emil's is no frills, good portions, very reasonable prices, VERY comfortable neighborhood hole in the wall...kind of like Cheers, but in a blue collar neighborhood in the 1950's. Fan-freakin-tastic! I could feel at home here.You definitely want to hit Mapquest or plug in your GPS though. I am not sure that I could find it again on my own...it really is a hidden gem. I will be making my friend take me back until I can memorize where the heck it is.Addendum: 2nd visit for the fish sandwich. Excellent. Truly. A pound of fish on a fish-shaped bun (as opposed to da burgh's seemingly popular hamburger bun). The fish was flavorful, the batter excellent, and for just $8. This may have been the best fish sandwich I've yet to have in da burgh.

"Duke...the owner...is the man.  He's a true Pittsburgher and he loves everyone from Pittsburgh.  He looks like he'll beat you up but he's a softy with a big heart.  Look for the bald guy with the raspy voice and make friends...he'll hook you up.  He's also totally into the development of other Pittsburgh businesses and he hosts events for local startups.  Ask him for a tour of the old Eat n Park next door...I believe his intention is still to turn it into an incubator of sorts.  Fortunately, the bar is close enough to the waterfront that it's just far enough out of the ghetto...the crowd is certainly decent.  Definitely have some beers on the porch in the summer...especially in the rain (lower level is covered).  Very relaxing atmosphere.  I wish my company was located in the area so we could frequent Dukes more steadily (we're on the north side).  Still worth the drive to feel at home, have a good bite and some cold beers.

"Visited for the MCG Holiday Jazz event and this place exceeded my expectations on all levels -- food, service, ambience, and entertainment.Food:  We ordered a small cheese platter.  The chef actually came out and explained the cheeses on our plate.  Nice touch, though I have to admit to not necessarily knowing which cheese went with which explanation.  Nonetheless, all were quite tasty and better than I would have imagined a simple cheese platter would be.  I ordered fish tacos which were quite tasty and my husband ordered the pork tenderloin, the Novemberfest special, which was also tasty from the bite I acquired from him, as were the squash bites I ""stole"".  Service:  Greeted immediately upon arrival and ushered to our table right away, despite being very early for our reservations.  Offered drinks as soon as we arrived at our table and our server was always there when needed but not pushy when we weren't in need.Ambience:  We sat in the small dining area next to the bar and near the stage.  Cozy, quaint, warm feel to it.  Nice venue to hear the jazz band while still being able to carry on a quiet conversation.Entertainment:  I've been trying to like jazz for awhile now and not all that successfully.  Last night was a winner for jazz band quality and for the vocalist's quality.  Very nice, indeed.

"Wow my Mom,husband and I had dinner there yesterday from a ad in the paper with Valentine's specials for the whole month of February. We ordered the Surf and Turf special. It started with a salad I had their classic which was HUGE and SUPER DELISH !!! The classic salad was a generous amount of spring mix,tomato,cucumber,purple onion,peppercini.   They have so many salad dressing choices not your ordinary blahzay boring choices. The spinach salad was also AMAZING spinach walnuts,feta,cranberries. The Caesar is what you would expect generous portion but average.Then a soup choice of French onion or soup de jour  (soup of the day) my husband had the french onion Wow he said it was prepared perfect and how french onion should be served a nice crock full and nice amount of cheese covering and balance of bread and soup. My mom and I had the soup of the day which was a roasted red pepper mushroom soup this was a soup we had never experienced and boy was it fabbie definitely a soup we shall enjoy again.Now the main course.a 6 oz Filet Mignon and 4-5 oz Lobster tail , Twice baked potato, Fresh white asparagus. The steak was cooked PERFECT my Mom and I ordered med rare my husband ordered his med and there was not an issue with either.If all this wasn't enough choice of homemade desserts  was carrot cake    or brownie a la mode.we all chose the brownie a la mode. It was HUGE the brownie was like a 4x4 brownie with a HUGE scoop of ice cream. Service was EXCELLENT our waitress was on top of things couldn't ask for better what an amazing establishment !

My only complaint is that there wasn't enough. It was juicy inside and so crispy on the outside. The fries that came along with the chicken were decent, but the fried chicken outshines them so much. It came with coleslaw as well, but it wasn't anything special. Standard coleslaw mix. Anything that was wrong with the rest of the food I received was immediately forgiven when I started eating the chicken. I also got the cheese sticks which are never a disappointment. I can't stop raving about the chicken, though.... GO. EAT CAIN'S FRIED CHICKEN! NOW!

"My wife and I wanted to try Cain's after we got a Yelp email around Halloween that highlighted the best Bloody Mary's in Pittsburgh. We bookmarked the places and figured eventually we'd hit them all. I called on a Wednesday in February one afternoon asking what time they served breakfast on Sunday's. My wife and I were celebrating our 1 year anniversary and wanted to grab brunch after we had gone for massages in the morning, somewhere laid back that we could also watch the olympics. When I called I didn't see the Yelp page that mentioned no reservations so I asked anyway. I spoke to Joe Demarco(sp) who was AWESOME! When I told Joey that we wouldn't be able to make it there until 12:30 (they stop serving breakfast at noon) he told me not to worry and that they'd make an exception for us. When we arrived on Sunday they had a table cleared and were ready for us. The food was fantastic! I got the Harvest Benedict (sauteed spinach and a veggie burger with a poached egg smothered in hollandaise). As a vegeterian I like to see stuff like this on the menu, creative veggie fare. The homefries were crispy and well done, and the hollandaise was rich and creamy. The bloody mary bar was a pretty cool idea as well. We had 2 each and enjoyed switching it up a little with the mixers and the various toppings. Nice job with pickles and the blue cheese stuffed olives! The wait staff was super friendly and extremely kind. When we got our bill we were told that Joey had gotten our first round of drinks! Way to go Cain's! You delivered a solid meal, excellent service and a great atmosphere. We'll definitely bring friends here and come back soon!

"I was fortunate enough to find this restaurant for a delicious lunch while traveling in the area.  I went off and performed my seminar then decided to return for a late supper. I sat at the bar and was served by a young woman whom I had assumed was the owner based on her superb professional demeanor. She informed me she was a 'very new' server.  WOW Araci's, hold on to this gem.  As it was late, I decided to create my own supper from various appetizers. One was better than the next, by the way, but I also wanted to point out that this 'very new' server had such a unique way of suggesting additional culinary delights, even this seasoned traveler was hooked, and glad he was! Everything she suggested was perfect.  My only regret is I don't live closer to Pittsburgh so I might be able to return.

Skip the other appetizers and start with the angry shrimp.  They do a really good job with a filet mignon.  The salmon picata looked yummy, but since it wasn't mine, I didn't get to taste it.  If you don't want a big meal, they have all the usual sandwiches and burgers.  For dessert, have the banana bread pudding or some yummy chocolate fudge cake!  Or, if you're not feeling fancy, just throw back a few beers and bacon cheddar burger.  It's that kind of place, too.

"Stick to basics and this is the best place in or around the 'burgh.  First time go with a friend and sit at the counter.  Short order cooking at it's best, it's like a floor show with the actor's backs to you.  Breakfast has no losers.  Eggs, omelets, pancakes, waffles, breakfast sandwiches to order, the ever popular mixed grill, get a 12 Louie instead of home fries (although they good as is) and don't forget the italian toast.Frequently voted the best burger in Pittsburgh for a reason.  As for ambiance, well lets just say I don't think there are two matching plates or coffee mugs in the joint.  But the coffee's good and hot and refreshed often as the service is good, andlocal with many long time folks working here.  If I don't get there for awhile I need to go through detox because I feel too healthy.

"Cheap, unpretentious, and, for this, one of my favorite breakfast joints in the country.  Simply put I LOVE it here.  The mixed grill, the sausage and egg on a biscuit, the home fries.  This it the very definition of diner.  Thank you Gab 'n' Eat!

"Okay, let's first set expectations.  This place is a true DIVE...this is not for the NYC foodie crowd.  If you want a down home, large portion awesome breakfast, this is the place.  The place is packed with happy diners, the server was very friendly in a busy grandma kind of way.  The best part - they have ""dippy"" eggs on the menu and define the degree of dippy you can order.  For anyone who has never heard of a ""dippy"" egg - this means sunny side up or over medium where the eggs are still runny and you can dip your bread in them.  The eggs were great - I ordered mine over medium, the breakfast potatoes were fab - no complicated additives like peppers or onions - just plain good potatoes cooked in fat - the best part - the fresh Italian bread.  YUM!!!

"I've lived in Pittsburgh for 6 years, and in Carnegie for over 2 years, and by far, this is the best greasy spoon joint I've found. If you can stomach the wait (no reservations, naturally), you'll enjoy overflowing plates of goodness, thanks to the well-seasoned griddle where all of the food is made. Here are the highlights:-Cheap: Breakfast for two can be well under $10, with lunch around the same.-Crowded: Get there early and expect to wait. They close pretty early on the weekends too (oddly, at 12:45pm)-Cash only-Huge portions: When ordering fries or homefries, always get the half order, unless you're a lumberjack-About those homefries: They're often undercooked. I've had better, believe me. My favorite things to eat in life are potato products.-My favorite item: hot sausage sandwich on thick Italian toast, with cheese, lettuce, tomato and mayo

"Love this place.  Never had a bad meal.  Good portions and great people.  Be ready to stand in line.

"My favorite breakfast place.  Have good sandwiches also.  Stopped again for Bfast and had the mixed grill--get the small portion unless you are a real MAN!  Mixed grill has sausage, (could it be Ricci's), eggs, onions, and home fries, soooo goooooooood!  Use Mancini's bread for toast, got the raisin toast - Yum.  Have had many other items and just love the food.  If you like to watch a true cook, sit at the counter.  Banter with the cook and staff and patrons is fun!Lunch is good, sausage sandwich, hamburgers and other lunch meats fried on the grill.Gets busy for Bfast so you may have to wait.Remember it is a diner.  Don't expect fancy decor.

"Great breakfast place. Come hungry. Look for Dick, my dad, and Gino at the counter every a.m. about 0830 and say hi. Try the mixed grill (half).

"BEST DINER IN THE COUNRTY!!! We've been to many famous diners across the country and we still give  Gab and Eat the best rating !! I was a little intimidated when I first walked in and there was like 2 pounds of butter just sitting on top of the homefires on the grill.  If you are looking for a healthy breakfast they probably can accomodate you, but Everything I ate was clearly the opposite of healthy.  After trying like every meal they have I would recommend the mix grill(half unless you are sharing) adding cajun seasoning with the texas toast.  Burgers are great too.It's hard to find a place that makes a better breakfast than you could make by yourself at home, but this place does it.  The atmosphere is classy, old school Americana.

"Best French toast ever!! Love the friendly atmosphere, and especially the breakfast. Never been disappointed. You have to try French toast with raisin bread too... yummy!

"Great Diner!  Their breakfast is the best in the area!  Lots of  choices and always good.  Love the unique mugs they use for coffee and all the writing on the wall.  Get there early otherwise you will not get a seat!  They have homemade hotsweet sausage and texas toast.

Her arm was broken or smth but she still dis a great job!Strawberry lemonade was just smth i have been craving for for so long but did not know what it was :) Strawberry milkshake, nachos and t bone steak is smth we never stop ordering!Its always nice when u go late at night like us, it is not crowded, not noisy, nice music playing and always nice people around. If you want smth quick and it is late at night then i would say Denny's!

"On a random Sunday morning I went in search of a good breakfast spot.  I decided to explore the McKees Rocks neighborhood and came upon Marge's Place.  I hadn't heard much about this place, but after reading the few reviews I could find, I decided to give it a try.  Inside, it's bigger than I expected but still has that down home diner feel.  My guess is that most of the people there were regulars.  The wait staff was friendly to those they knew but also welcoming to me, someone they had never seen before.  I picked a table in the corner so I could observe what I imagine was a typical Sunday morning.  I ordered the breakfast special: 2 scrambled eggs with bacon, potatoes and toast.  Any place that has Mancini's Italian toast already gets thumbs up in my book.  Being in McKees Rocks, though, they really don't have a choice.  The potatoes were thin sliced with onions and very flavorful.  The only way I can think of to describe the bacon is...porkier.  Is that even a word  I just don't know how else to descibe it.  The combination of foods was served in generous portions at a great price (under $5).  One random note: I liked the tables and chairs.  They were comfortable not just for sitting and enjoying a cup of coffee with my morning paper but also very comfortable for sitting and eating.  Good distance between the table and chairs.  That may sound silly, and I thought so, too, at first.  But when I go to a place and the booth is too wide or too narrow, it can hinder my enjoyment.  Not only will I return, but I will also recommend Marge's Place to anyone in the area.  It was a surprisingly good find.  I like places like neighborhood businesses like this where they make everyone feel like they belong.

"I have live around this area all my life and My family would go here and I would always decline to go, that is until Saturday my brother asked me if I wanted to go to breakfast and I had to say yes (just posted on facebook that I wanted to go to breakfast and nobody wanted to go with me) Lets get to the review I am glad I said yes there homefries are awesome the eggs were just right. I would definitely go here again.

"I'm new to Pittsburgh so I wanted to try out all the local spots first and let me tell you... This spot is definitely worth a try! It's a cute diner with a lot of local charm. The prices are awesome and the food is even better! I had the cinnamon raisin french toast with the home fries and a coffee. All of it was really good. I'm not a complainer but I'm picky and honestly...I have nothing but good things to say about this place. I highly recommend you stop by and give it a try! You can thank me later. ;)

"Great service, friendly staff, great food, great prices. What more can you ask for in a small town breakfast place Will definitely be back

"I love this place. Normally, it would have been 4.5 stars, but since they moved to a smoke free environment, it gets a 5 star rating. The staff is quick, friendly and very ""with it."" This is a true family business and the food is fantastic. I love the jumbot! It's amazing and hearty. The coffee isn't the best, but the food makes up for it. The french toast and pancakes are lovely too. This is not the place to go if you are dieting as they are GENEROUS with the butter. I like this place way better than Pamelas, which, apart from the strawberry crepes, doesn't really do it for me. It was recently on the Food Network too so I'm not the only one that feels that way!
",1
"Let's start with the conclusion - this place is the very best breakfast diner in Pittsburgh.  Why  In very large part, because *everything* on the menu is made fresh daily.  This includes the ham, which the restaurant roasts every morning, complete with their own glaze.  The ham is cut from the bone to order, absolutely succulent, with a hint of clove.  The ham alone is reason enough to visit this place, but that isn't even the best offering.First are the pancakes, which includes specialty pancakes like apple and cinnamon and pumpkin - all of which (including buttermilk pancakes) are among the very best pancakes I've ever eaten.  The batter is prepared fresh every morning.  They have a slightly crispy exterior (plenty of butter and sugar in the batter) and fluffy center.  The apple and cinnamon pancakes are so good that I don't even eat them with syrup lest I mask the subtle flavors of cinnamon, cream, vanilla, and apples in the batter - a dusting of powdered sugar and a smear of half-melted butter is all that's needed to elicit an involuntary eyes-rolling-into-the-back-of-the-head expression of pleasure.  Seriously, these pancakes are DAMN good!Second, all the egg entrees are fabulous!  Try the eggs benedict - that juicy ham, fresh cut from the bone, piled high atop two thick slabs of toasted Italian bread, topped with sunny-side-up eggs, and freshly prepared hollandaise.  Fantastic.  The omelets are great, and the ""jumbot"" - an ""everything in the prep table"" hash of stuff and scrambled eggs will satisfy the heartiest of diners.The food here is really top-notch.  I realize that it's just a diner, but when I see and taste food this good, and this lovingly prepared, I want to see *everything* as perfect as most of the food.  With that in mind, I'd really like to see the restaurant offer real maple syrup - not the imitation ""table syrup"" stuff that I've seen them pour from a milk-carton-type paper container into the syrup bottles!  I'd gladly even pay a $1 premium to have real syrup with those delectable pancakes.  Also, I'd beg them to consider making their own biscuits, and possible serving them with a sausage (or sausage and herb) gravy.  I'd *crawl* to the Dor-Stop from my home to eat there!This place is PACKED on the weekends - be prepared to wait unless you get there very early.  The wait, however, will be worth it.  I eat here at least once nearly every weekend for breakfast.

"Went this this morning and I am wondering why the hell it tool me so long to go here. Awesome food, fresh and the staff was even better. Won't eat anywhere else for breakfast in the burg! Gotta get here
",1
"OMG!  Hands down the best pancakes I have ever put in my mouth. Sometimes I day dream about Dor Stop pancakes.  Too bad I live 6 hours away or I'd go there everyday.  The service was just ok, but the place was packed and the food was well worth the wait.
",1
"My breakfast was absolutely phenomenal. I specifically ordered the ham and eggs because it included their famous potato pancakes. They did not disappoint I tried every trick in the book to get what they put in them but no luck. I even promised some things I should be ashamed of LOL I would definitely recommend that if you are anywhere within 50 miles you need to make a trip here!
",1
"The Dor-Stop restaurant has an enchanting, old fashioned look inside and out that effectively conveys its main appeal: good simple cooking at reasonable prices. The menu has typical diner favorites. I ordered the ham off the bone breakfast (with their special ham, potato pancakes, eggs, and toast) and true to form, it was very good (ham was still relatively moist despite having been on the griddle) and was reasonably priced at about $7.   I went around lunch time on a weekday and the restaurant was about half full, so I didn't have to wait. Food came quickly and service was good (even though the young waitress oddly addressed me as ""honey"" every time).  As I was finishing up, an older gentleman, seemingly a ""regular,"" came in and was greeted warmly by the waitstaff. He took a seat at the counter and the staff told him what specials they could make for him. (He ended up getting a chicken salad sandwich on texas toast plus a bowl of soup.) And he chatted with the staff as he enjoyed his lunch. I'm guessing that this guy like many others are regulars here and know what a great place this is and keep coming back.

"I had no idea that this restaurant was ""legendary"" when I decided to eat there this morning with my family.  I was severely hungover and just needed some grease, and the concierge at my mother's hotel happened to recommend this place.The restaurant is ""cozy"" (read: small) and situated in a really quaint neighborhood at the top of a massive (and somewhat scary) hill. The restaurant itself was buzzing and had a great neighborhood vibe. Despite it being *packed,* we were seated right away.The menu wasn't too fussy but there were a lot of options. I ordered the dor-stop burger (burger with sauteed onions and green peppers, american cheese and two slices of texas toast) and fries. My husband got the mushroom swiss burger with onion rings and we split our meals. The food was simple enough but amazingly delicious. I think they battered the onion rings in crack. I also ordered an orange juice, which I could tell was fresh squeezed.The portion sizes were reasonable too! Not gigantic, which I appreciate. I finished my meal feeling like a brand new woman. I think I'll look for reasons to come to Pittsburgh now that I know this restaurant exists. Yum.

"If you ever need an explanation of what a bottomless cup of coffee truly signifies, check out the Dor-Stop.In addition to that lesson, the you will experience the following:-Hotcakes so good you don't need to add syrup (mine were oatmeal raisin, like eating the amazing hybrid of a cookie and pancake)-Potato pancakes so good that you'll wish you had multiple orders-Slabs of ham. So good.Add in the great service, ease to find parking, and decent prices and this place is truly a gem. Don't let the wait scare you unless you have a large group - people flow out of there pretty quickly, and for 2 people on a Sunday we only had to wait 10 minutes (and they gave us free samples while we waited). And it is definitely worth the wait.

"Like many others before me I came to the Dor-Stop with high expectations and let me tell you, my expectations were exceeded.My girlfriend and I have been looking for a new breakfast spot for a while and the Dor-Stop has always been high on my list to try.The place is classic, still has a bar counter, kitschy items adorn the walls and the a feeling that you are dining in your grandmother's restaurant. The place is always packed but we were quickly seated and like many have stated before my coffee cup never fell below 34 full before it was refilled.Now lets get to the nitty gritty: the food.I got the pancake breakfast, usually a very simple and easy breakfast but when the breakfast came I was so impressed. The hotcakes are so different, some would even say magical. They are so fluffy and moist and complimented their super crispy bacon. I almost wanted to fold the entire breakfast up and eat a giant pancake eggarito. My mouth is watering thinking about it.My girlfriend got the breakfast sandwich which was very well done. Their ham is so succulent and tender. They cut it off the bone at the Dor-Stop and is shows. The sandwich is a work of art and is the classiest breakfast sandwich I have ever seen. I recommend this place to anyone and will definitely come back to try some other types of pancakes. They are the best in the city.Oh and try the potato pancakes, they will rock your world.

"I called on Memorial Day and said ""I was just checking if you're open today."" ""No,"" she snapped, ""we're closed, ya jest woke me up!"" Well, with customer service like that, I knew this had to be a real diner.And boy oh boy was I right. Hotcakes thick and soft as fresh cookies, something called ""jumbot"" (which seems to be Pittsburghese for ""whatever we scraped off the grill"", but boy is it good), and good luck finding the bottom of a cup of coffee, because they'll never let you get low enough to see it.Maybe these aren't the hugest pancakes in town (that honor goes to the MANcakes at Eggs-R-Us in Crafton), but they sure are delicious. Well worth a few minutes' wait for a table.

"This place has more heart than a cardiac surgeon's office, and more personality than the Meyers Briggs Test. Ba dum dum.But in all seriousness, that's what makes this a five star review rather than a four. Mama Ros runs the shop along with her life love Mike, and she and he will treat you as one of their own kids (but, you know, in like a warm, life-affirming way rather than creepy).Saying that they're not in it for the money would be an understatement. The food is great diner breakfastlunch fare at extremely reasonable prices (and by ""extremely reasonable"", I mean that it's freaking cheap). Mama Ros and Mike really just want to feed you. They give food to the homeless, and every Thanksgiving they host a huge donation-based Thanksgiving dinner for all those who can't afford throwing a feast themselves or who can't be with their families during the holiday (or who would rather avoid being with their families in favor of the awesome Thanksgiving party that is Mama Ros's turkey dinner).Great food, a business that's truly for the community, and a home away from home experience. Place puts a smile on my face every time.

"If you are looking for a place that has high class  decor.... this place is definitely NOT for you at all.  If you want a REAL down to earth place without any fakeness... this is definitely the place for you.  This is a very tiny place that hold 18 people inside (plus two table on the outside)I love this place.   The food is great!!!!!The food is to die for.  Mama R. will make anything you want even though it may not be on the  menu.  The portions are very generous.  The place is owned by two awesome people (Mike and Ros).  They are definitely from the 60s era.  Don't let the employees scare you away.  They are ALL super nice people.They have body piercings and tatoos every where.  Immediately after walkingin I felt so comfortable. Thanks Ross for an awesome breakfast.PS.. This place only take cash.

"I was looking for a quick bite after an early morning work out and took a chance based on the yelp reviews. This place is a gem. ""Mom"" is a typical short order chef with years of experience under her belt. The food was hot, fresh and simple and the coffee was surprisingly good. Even though it is clearly a locals place (four people came and went whose food came without ordering it), the owner couple were welcoming and chatty. I heard all about their thanksgiving. They were closed Thursday and Friday to serve or deliver 300 meals to the needy in their community. 130 deliveries and others picked up. The community supports them financially but they cooked for nearly two weeks to make it happen. 100% gratuity well deserved. Keep it up mom!

"Need a cheap breakfast served to you by people that treat you like family as soon as you come in the door This is your spot.The food is solid dinner food. You will get a good meal at an excellent price, and probably a hug. The place is small, so if they are busy be prepared to stand and waitIt is what it is. A quirky place to grab a meal run by a really nice couple.I would be remiss to review this place and not mention the free Thanksgiving meal the Sandwich Shop does for those that have no place to go, can't afford it, or are shut in.

"I love Bruegger's. I'm a member of their ""Bottomless Mug Club"" which costs about $150 for the year and entitles me to unlimited free beverages for a year. Many times your receipt includes a survey to get a dollar-off coupon.Prepared bagels and sandwiches are a bit pricey but there are a lot of coupons and promotions available. The ""Last Night's Bagels"" are a great deal and if toasted, taste almost fresh.

"Without a doubt one of the nicest places I have ever had the pleasure of laying my head......having wine and cheese.......or breakfasting.The Inn on Negley is gorgeously appointed.  The individual rooms, all named for varieties of apple, are spectacular.  We were in the lovely Northern Spy.  The bed was wonderfully comfortable, the linens unbelievably soft and luxurious.  L'Occitane bath products smelled divine.  The Shadyside neighborhood outside of downtown is quiet but still conveniently located to all the Pittsburgh doings.Breakfast each morning, cooked by the hospitable Chef Jackie, is pure pleasure.  Each night on your pillow a menu card appears; check off what you'd like in the morning, what time you'll be eating, and drop it off in the dining room.  The next day, Jackie is ready and waiting with a fresh fruit plate, the pastry of the day, and fantastically strong and flavorful coffee.  Omelets and fritattas are made with local produce and eggs.  Irish oatmeal is served with milk from a nearby creamery.  Toast bread changes daily but is always whole-grain and delicious.  Breakfast meats are lean and filling.  Afternoons, iced tea and cookies are set out, and in the evenings wine and cheese served.  Enjoy them in a rocker on the front porch, relaxing on the back deck retreat, or in the privacy of your room.  Staff is not only eminently professional, but warm and gracious.  Heidi at the front desk was beyond helpful in making suggestions for what to do in the city or where to eat (I will be forever indebted to her for recommending what was probably our best meal of the trip at Soba).  If you ever find yourself in Pittsburgh, lodgings can't get much better than the Inn on Negley.That's probably sufficient gushing.

"Pittsburgh has a Four Seasons!From Paris to Shanghai, London to Bangkok, the care with which this little B&B operation is run in Pittsburgh exceeds the best that I have experienced in any of these cities.It may not have the conference facilities of a larger hotel, the business center, or in-house spa, but as a B&B, this is about as good as it gets. The structure in which the whole thing is held (do we call it a 'house') is old (perhaps we could say it generically to be 'victorian') with decor to match. These are far from our tastes, but they compensate (in our eyes) by taking good care of what they have. The TVs aren't even old flat screens, but they do stock the rooms thoroughly with l'occitane.Where this place really shines is in the staff and the food. I actually find this aspect to be _better_ or even _much_ better than many celebrated big-city five-star properties. When was the last time that the night staff pulled some food from the refrigerator (gratis) after a midnight arrival caused by flight delaysThey make everything in-house and it is all extraordinary. On this last visit, I indulged in their traditional french toast with a side of eggs. I forgot that this all includes an additional course in advance with fruit (not just big grocery store chucks of melon) and house-made cookies and muffins. On each visit, they mix these up. For this December visit, they did gingerbread cookies (of course). The Chef (Jackie), from NYC, could be gainfully employed high up the hierarchy of any top big-city restaurant.There is no elevator, so either pack light if you want a room on the 3rd floor or choose a 1st or 2nd floor room. The 1st floor room has double doors so I didn't find it any noisier than the others. You are in a city and on a reasonably busy street, so don't expect the charming home to be continued into a surrounding yard (although they do have an attractive new deck out back).

"Amazing!I recently hosted my friend's bridal shower here and everything was absolutely perfect!  Heidi went above and beyond helping me plan from 3 hours away, including taking pictures of the tea room and promptly responding to my many many emails. The Inn itself is gorgeous, and the staff was extremely professional and accommodating. A++++!!!

"just returned from a three day weekend at the inn with 12 sorority sisters from around the country.  It is understandable why the inn gets such rave reviews.  From the extraordinary service of the staff which was both accommodating AND anticipating, to the beautifully furnished and outfitted rooms  (I stayed in the Braeburn on the first floor which was large, comfortable, and filled with light), to the delicious breakfasts, it was an outstanding experience all around.  I am thrilled to spread the word and recommend your inn without reservation.

"What a wonderful location!  My sister's future MIL hosted her bridal shower here and with 11 people, we had our own private room.  It was tastefully decorated and beautiful.  The Inn on Negley also has a private parking lot in the back meant for their guests but street parking is plentiful around there, as well.The tea room is simply gorgeous and the variety of tea is plentiful and delicious!  They even had a blue & yellow tea for us (the bride's wedding colors) and I loved the fact that we could request a different type of tea the second time around.  The food was delicious from the cucumber finger sandwiches to the apricot scones.What a lovely spot for afternoon tea and I look forward to returning again to Pittsburgh - may want to stay there next time!

"I requested a stay at the Inn on Negley when traveling on business back to Pittsburgh.  I lived in town for 5 years and had not had an opportunity to return in more years than that I am afraid. This place was just what I needed. I sought a more personal experience than a canned commercial hotel could offer.I was so grateful to get to stay in this pristine, classy, comfortable Inn. The staff was welcoming, sweet, helpful, and kind. The room was lovely. The best part was waking up in the morning! Breakfast made me feel like a queen on her birthday. The food was perfect. Gorgeous and delicious. The carefully cut fresh fruit salad, coffee, french toast option, and housemade pastries were top shelf! The  creative meals and fresh ingredients were professionally planned, carefully prepared, and out of this world! I bought my host a gift certificate for brunch in thanks just so he could share in how fabulous the treatment is. I'd return in a heartbeat.

"Went for brunch with a group of ladies and we had a great time!  The inn is really lovely and it's a great if you want to try something new or different for brunch!Service is impeccable and the whole atmosphere is just so elegant!  The brunch service is basically a four course meal: fruit, breads, entree, dessert!  And you also have you choice of juices, coffee andor tea!All the things we tried were delicious!  There were so many things, I can barely remember.  They also serve Afternoon Tea, which I'm sure is fabulous!!! So, that's definitely next on my list!

"We absolutely loved our stay at the Inn on Negley!! There is so much to review and not enough space to do it. We stayed in the Cortland suite which was so comfortable and quiet. It was a room off by itself which I was unaware of at the time of booking. That made it so much better. The bed was extremely comfortable, the bathroom was spacious and the decor was spectacular. The only part I didn't quite like was the street noise early in the morning. The breakfast was insanely good with so many choices other than the typical continental. There were eggs, belgian waffles, pancakes, etc to choose from. Each morning breakfast began with a cup of fresh cut up fruit and a freshly baked pastry. The service was perfect with the proper amount of attention without being too invasive. The staff was one of the most polite and courteous I've ever encountered. Thank you so much for making our stay perfect. I hope to visit again some day.

"Um, hello, this place has been open for over 60 years.  On that fact  alone they receive 5 stars from me.Do they have some magic type of fryers that no one else in the world has I think so because I honestly couldn't tell my meal was fried at all. I had the fish, shrimp, and chips combo and every item was crispy, light, and as ungreasy as fried food can get.  The interior is old and outdated for sure and it's totally in the ""hood"" but who cares.  Darn good fish and chips IMHO.  ---PS, they have one of those pump thingies of ranch on their condiment bar so even if you don't like your meal just cover it in good old American ranch dressing.

"Strange...the reviews seem to be all over the place  for this the best seafood joint in town.  I think their 60 year operation speaks for itself.  I've been a semi-regular for years now and love their fish.  It's the best breading I've ever tried.  Almost as important as the fish, to me, is you must have good tartar sauce.  If it's crap you can have the best fish and you've still lost me as a customer.  KKL does it right....best, freshest fish and the best tartar in town.  A few have mentioned that it's not in the best neighborhood.  What does this really mean  Does location have some effect on a restaurants ability to cook food  Or does your concern for it's location say more about you...

"My Sister-in-law's mom forces her and my brother to take her to Knock Kneed Lobster every time she comes into town from Baltimore.  We met up with them .2 piece fish and shrimp wchips.  They even have pasta for the vegetarians!  The Mizithra Cheese Pasta was WAY WAY WAY better than The Spaghetti Factory!  We got a side of hush puppies...SOOOO YUMMY!  WAY WAY WAY better than Pete's Fish and Chips (which is still good).There is only 1 problem ... no Diet Coke ....Pepsi products :(
",1
"For the past 15 years or so, I have been a satisfied and happy customer of KKL.  I absolutely love everything about Knock Kneed.  The fish is among the best that you will find in the Phoenix area.  I am also a big fan of the okra.  The ambiance here is also quite enjoyable.  There is plenty of seating inside the restaurant and the nautical themed decorations make it one of a kind.You can't go wrong here!

"Got a craving for fish and chips Best place in town I think. Great Fish and Shrimp.

"I am a big fan of Knock Kneed Lobster!It really is a dive, but Jeannie behind the counter is one of the kindest people I have ever met in food service.  We had the King Crab Legs for only $15.95 with 2 sides.  Most of the side choices are deep fried, but the were all hand breaded and prepared when ordered. NO frozen and fried side orders here like most every other place you go.  This no-frills ""joint"" prepares each meal for the customer as they arrive.  I doubt that they even own a heat lamp.  Oh BTW...  Our meal was GREAT!  I shall return!

"If you want good fish and chips this is the place. hand filleted  very light batter on the fish, fries are old fashioned not processed and frozen elsewhere. The only place that compares is Spud Fish and Chips in Seattle WA on Greenlake.These are the best fish and chips in the World!
",1
"As far as basic fried fish and chips goes knock need has it down. Yes, it's a total dive hole in the wall and if you don't like the ambience get it to go.  Better than other local city chains.  They batter their own fish and if someone asked me where to go for good fried fish in the Phoenix area it would be Knock Kneed. Where they get the lobster part in their name I have no idea.

"My grand parents came here back when it was called ""lazy Lew's"" back in the 50's. The place is a total dive but it's fitting and its in an industrial part of phoenix. However the food is great and so is their home made hot sauce

"Just ate here for the first time today and it was awesome!!  Had the Catfish Sandwich and the best I have had since Chicago.. You need to eat here!!

"Get the fish! Skip the chips! Few things are better than a made-to-order, hand-breaded, fresh, fish sandwich. This catfish filet was NOT frozen. The cornmeal breading was very crunchy. Cooked perfectly. Light, flaky, NOT greasy at all. Just a perfect sandwich all around. Get this, the combo plate was only $6.50. Seriously Awesome.When asked if I wanted hot sauce or mayo on the sandwich, I replied, ""both."" BEST DECISION EVER! The hot sauce adds the necessary flavor to the mildly seasoned breading while the mayo provides the creaminess that a tartar sauce adds without the overwhelming tartar flavor. (Note: I'm not a big tartar sauce fan bc it hides the flavor of the fish).So, skip the fries. They're just frozen potatoes that don't taste like anything. I'm still giving Mandy's 5 stars, because the sandwich was truly exceptional. And honestly, didn't come for the fries. But ask them which sides are made on site. The onion rings and fried okra are probably good. PS-don't worry about it being catfish. It's seriously good.PPS-I grew up around a LOT of fish fries in Kentucky. No catfish has ever been this good. GO!
",1
"If you truly love fish this is the spot. I went in at Mandys and ordered the cat combo which includes three catfish three shrimp and chips, truly it was the best decision ever.
",1
"visited for the first time today,  and really liked it.  Mandy was very friendly and talked over the menu with me it being my first time.  The Cod was amazing and juicy not greasy! I really liked the homemade cocktail sauce.  I am glad I stopped in and I am sure I will be back.

"This location is isolated for being by the light rail. We stopped by on a Sunday at noon. There were no other customers at the time. The establishment is very clean and ventilated. The style has character and thankfully does not clutter the walls with kitchy decorations. The staff is very friendly as well as attentive. We ordered fried calamari rings and catfish shrimp combos with drinks. The prices are very reasonable, although there was a discrepancy on the chalk written price. The fish is freshly battered on the spot and the food is cooked in a timely manner. The batter and oil for each food item is specialized. The calamari rings were excellent with the marinara sauce. They were not too crunchy and not too rubbery, just perfect. The catfish came in three long strips over steak fries, three shrimp, and sides of sauces. Moist, tender, crunchy, and packed with flavor is how I would describe both the catfish and butterfly shrimp. The green tea reminds me of the imported teas in international markets in california. We will order from this place for office lunches in the future.
",1
"Surprisingly empty during lunch hour. No frills restaurant located off of the 28th Street Washington light rail station. Had the three piece catfish meal with fries,  shrimp, hush puppies and a large drink for under $12. Meal is cooked to order instead of sitting in a bin under a heat lamp waiting for you. Generous portions, scalding hot, and unlike those other places comes with more fish than breading. Flavorful and great value. Definitely will be back.
",1
"I stuffed myself...to an inappropriate level. Each piece of fish is perfectly crisp and fried. The oil is fresh so the fish is always light and fluffy on the inside and crunchy on the outside. They're secret is the cornmeal fry mixture they use. They also use it in their hushpuppies---TO DIE FOR!!! Next time i'm going for the slaw and sweet potato side.  This'll be my new late-night haunt for folks when they come to visit.
",1
"I was looking for Fish on a Friday with three kids in the car and didn't want to get out. No problem because Mandy ' s has a mother's most coveted convenience, a Drive through!  If you don't call ahead expect to wait because the fish is freshly cooked. Crispy, hot and delicious. We may have to make this a regular Friday event and add dessert. They have perfectly cooked sweet potatoes pie to satisfy that sweet tooth. Yum yum delicious Mandy's.

"Been there many times and never had anything but good food! The person that said that the Bulgogi was so-so must have killed their taste buds......best in town, and we have tried almost all of em. This is their 3 rd location over 20 years so they must be doing something right! Cash only, terrible location, and other drawbacks, but worth the drive for us from Summerlin.

"I love this hole in the wall Korean joint!  I have only ordered one dish from there and that's all I really need.  The Beef Bulgogi is amazing!  I get it spicy with noodles instead of rice.  Definitely worth a visit.

"Love this place, love the food, love the atmoshpere.  It seems like the menu is always changing here.Butternut squah croquettes are awesome, the black bean veggie burger is swell.

"A small English pub tucked away in  an alley behind harris teeter.  They have a huge outdoor eating area.  The inside has a large community table in the back for when the restaurant gets crowded.  They have an extensive beer selection.  As far as the food goes you have to be very careful.  I have tried many things on the menu and I have only been impressed by the bacon cheeseburger and the fish and chips.  But, the bacon cheeseburger is the best you'll get anywhere.  The food is also very affordable.

"Sir Ed's: Have to say I was there the first night they opened their doors and have been returning ever since. It has the best of many worlds, go early enough, it is a great Restaurant with a ""different"" menu than what you would expect (You have to try the Ostrich Meatloaf!). Go a little later in the evening, it is the classic ""pub"". I enjoy them both. I have been to restaurants and pubs all over Europe and the USA.  Sir Ed's ranks right up there with the best of them.It is a great place to go for a celebration or just to grab a beer in the evening. Draft selection is great, a true bonus if you like English beer! (and Guinness!) I have always found the staff to be outstanding..Over the years, they have had a couple that were not up to the task but thankfully they did not last. Bar Staff is always wonderful and accommodating and over the years have become friends. Great place to go!!!

"Oh my, I love Sir Ed's. It is without a doubt the best bar in Charlotte. Sir Ed's doesn't have the biggest beer list or any unique drinks, but they make up for it in quality. My last few years of college I came in about once a week, sometimes more. I chose Sir Eds for my first legal drinks. Now when I come back to Charlotte the trip isn't complete without a plate of Jamaican Jerk Chicken nachos and a beer. Sir Ed's has some of the best barpub food  you'll find. Worth coming just for dinner. In the springsummerfall, the patio is fantastic. My world felt like it fell apart when Sir Ed's closed briefly, and I am so happy they're back!

"Sir Ed's is a local's restaurant and bar and, as such, is perfect.Note to non-locals: you will find a warm welcome.Part of the attraction of Sir Ed's is the 'hidden' location down an alley between the ski store and Rack Room Shoes. Head down the stairs and through the door without the sign and you're in a special place.You'll find...A sensibly-priced menu with a curious mix of pub favorites, Mexican-inspired dishes, and some simply way-out-there items. There's plenty for the vegetarian and even the vegan.A great staff including two of Charlotte's top bartenders.A superb patio in the warmer months plus a great 'warm and cozy' feel in the winter.Full menu until 2 a.m. every nightmorning.A generally civilized atmosphere.You can hear what the person next to you is saying even when Sir Ed's is full.A great lunch menu with some excellent deals.Full bar with an always interesting selection of beers and wines.There's a reason that 'Sir Ed's virgins' become regulars. It's a special place.You also get free birthday on your dinner.Go to this link. http:eepurl.comg_TTA

"Jabari wings are the best wings in Charlotte.  Grilled to a perfect char, with a sweet ginger teriyaki sauce, they are perfect!Chicken fried chicken, black bean burger, fish & chips, butternut squash croquettes and jerk chicken nachos are also HIGHLY recommended.

"Half-price bottles on wine on Sunday! I don't think I need to say more, but I will. I just love this place. It's cozy and off the beaten path. The fish and chips were perfection as was the goat cheese fritters. I can't wait to go back...on a Sunday of course.

"The Avenue is just classic. Went there this weekend with friends. Their fish fry is great - but we went for steaks and prime rib. Some of the best in town easily! I love their shrimp too. I agree with Joe R - - its far from health food. I went with the baked potato instead of the hash browns just to lower my total grease intake. Very good food and great atmosphere and service!

"Coming from a city that has elevated the Friday Fish Fry to a culinary art form, I'm delighted to see the Avenue Fish Fry throwin' it down in Mad-town. The fish pieces are plump and juicy, the breading flavorful and the presentation always high quality and not overly greasy. Good selection of sides, nice old school Wisconsin atmoshphere. Be prepared to wait a long time for a table on a Friday night. Popular place.

"Growing up in a family that didn't really eat a lot of fish, I made it to my 30's without actually eating a ""fish boil.""  Visiting Madison, I decided the right thing to do was to finally sample this regional delicacy.  A little research led me to the Avenue Bar, a place that will now always hold a special place in my heart.What's not to love  It's been open since the mid-fifties and probably hasn't changed much since then.  It is like a combo dive barrestaurant, and is chaotic beyond belief on the weekends.  Packed with families, blue hairs, the beer and a shot crowd, Lions ClubMasonic order-types and various other characters, this is the kind of place Archie Bunker would have been right at home at and I was as well.  You can just tell these people have been coming in here for 50 years every Friday night - it's fantastic! One of the happiest crowds I've ever seen, people love this place. I agree with the other reviewers - make a reservation.The food was fantastic - I had the fish boil, my friend had the fish fry.  Insanely good - I don't even know how to put it into words, but that fish boil still haunts my dreams. Cod, potatoes, carrots, onion all cooked together in one heavenly mess - it sounds weird, but dammit, you have to eat it to believe it.  Hands down, one of the best meals I've ever eaten.  The fried cod was equally great,  it's a classic and they have it perfected here. This is artery clogging food at it's best,  I can't believe they don't make you sign a waiver before you eat here.Locally owned, great wait staff, very inexpensive, loaded with character - easily my favorite dining destination in Madison.
",1
"Their Friday fish-fry is to die for (stick with the traditional cod). No wonder they've been voted as the Madison's 1 fish-fry favorites year after year. Call ahead and make a reservation if you are planning to go for the Friday affair. The place is literally packed. My friend and I got lucky and was seated at the nice booth seat right next to the bar. While waiting for our food to come, we got to watch locals enjoying themselves at the bar. My bloody marry was a perfect accompaniment to the cod. I think my friend enjoyed his martini and perch as well.  The food is excellent, the service is excellent, and it's got the homey atmosphere - I have nothing to complain about this place.

"Great service. Solid food. Consistent and reliable. You will not be disappointed if you go to the Avenue for drinks or for dinner. A very good value for your dollar. Only thing that doesn't live up to billing is the dessert.

"I grew up in Wisconsin. Eating at Avenue Bar was like stepping right back into 1971. I could really sense my Wisconsin roots. Went for a Friday night fish fry, had the cod. Loved their Bloody Mary, and the Brandy Alexander brought tears of joy to my eyes. Oh yeah!!-- the fish fry was also great. A ""must visit"" place. They have a fish boil as well.
",1
"I love this place... It brought back so many Wisconsin memories since that is where I grew up... We had the  Brandy old fashion sweet... They make a good one and we had the fish fry--- yummm..... Many a Friday night was spent at the local fish fry places when we lived there.... The crowning touch was a brandy alexander.... They don't make them with ice cream any where but in Wisconsin--- to die for.....

"We stopped in the Avenue this past Saturday after the Badger-Beaver football game and were very pleased to see the live music behind the bar as usual for home games.   Very fun!Since being purchased by the Food Fight people, the Avenue has been different but the same.  The different is all good - cleaned up, remodeled bathrooms, spruced up all around.  Craig managing the bar is godsend for the Avenue.  The same is good too with nearly every staff member retained, great pours on drinks and good food and service.Most of the negative reviews on Yelp came at the tail end of the past era when things were not so good.It's really worth a try now.  Do it!  And support those Saturday afternoon musicians.

"Excellent service.  Excellent food.  We have passed this place up for years.  We always thought it was as the name says, a bar.  Yes, it has a bar but it is only a precursor to a wonderful meal.  We have enjoyed ourselves here many times.  I highly recommend you try it out.  You'll be hooked!!

"I walked in and I was taken back into time. I am a ""mature"" seasoned citizen. The Avenue reminded me of numerous restaturant & bars in Chicago. Not too bright, not too dim. Crowded and lots of lively conversation coming from the bar and restaurant. I came here for the FISH FRY. I heard it was top notch. They were right! Started off with an excellent New England clam chowder. There were substantial pieces of clams in the soup! Surprise, surprise! Very well seasoned. I did not even consider adding salt or pepper. I am sensitive to salt and it was not overdone. Next came the Fried Cod. It wasn't a Long John Silver's fry. It was more like a tempura batter. A light coating over two large fillets. I chose fries to accompany the plate. For a Friday night at 7:00pm, only had to wait 15 minutes. Very courteous and accommodating staff. Well, I will be back to try other items on the menu. But then again, maybe not. I have been to the top of the mountain! I like fish too. Give them a try.Johnny Chitown

"I have not much to review as of now, but will update later, as  I have just booked Quivey's for my wedding in August 2009. If anyone has had thier wedding here and would like to share with me photos, I am planning the wedding long distance and it would be greatly appreciated.So far, I have talked with the business event manager 3 times and she was great each time. I had a long list of questions before I put down a small deposit and she answered each one!

"Love the Stable Grill. Great drinks, great food, great atmosphere. So romantic around Christmas. I just wish they had more variety on the menu. We try to go here often.
",1
"The consensus opinion among the eight people at our table is that Quivey's has the best Friday fish fry we've tried. It also has a really interesting ambiance, with a fun underground tunnel connecting the quieter, more formal seating in the Stone House to the more casual dining in the Stable Grill. For a night out with our family and a family of friends, it's a lot better to eat in the Stable Grill portion of the restaurant, rather than the (more formal) Stone House: the Stable is more suited to our boisterous group, but you'll still want to walk through the tunnel to the wine cave and the Stone House, just to look around if you have to wait for a table. (They do a brisk business, so it's best to call ahead.) Also, the cheese curds are only available in the Stable Grill portion (and the kids like these even better than the ones at The Old Fashioned, though the parents might split hairs on that one).
",1
"Great Fish Fry! Try the Parmesan potatoes, you will not be disappointing. Very affordable fish fry, great atmosphere and service. We tried the pudding for desert which was also delicious! We will be returning and recommending our friends. There are two restaurants, but on Fridays both serve the fish fry. The bar doesn't take reservations and is first come first serve. Usually a 30 min wait, so grab a beer! If you don't want to wait jump over the house and there usually is seating available. We are hoping to experience the barn next time.

"This is a review of their Thursday Nights Jazz in the Grove.We had a very enjoyable evening with some fantastic jazz.  We hope to go back again this year.This is a unique venue for Madison and I hope it continues.   We need more places like this.Thanks Quivey's!

"The Salomon salad for lunch was simply the best food I have eaten for 11 bucks.  The service was fantastic.  Sometimes I wonder if people who complain about bad service receive bad service because they are not the friendliest people themselves.  I also was here for a grooms dinner and there wasn't a complaint in the party.  My beef tenderloin was awesome!

"Fridat night fish fry!

"This is my favorite place for Friday fish fry. I can't find a better place in Madison.
",1
"My benchmark for reviews.  You're given the choice between the main house or the stable - the former caters to an older crowd, the latter a younger one.  Try the stable first - bigger menu, more affordable prices.  The food: flavorgasm-inducing.  The service: friendly, prompt, and non-obtrusive.  The setting: interesting and relatively quiet.  They make a nice drink too.  On a Friday, try the combo plate of fish and thank me later.  Bacon-wrapped pork, beef medallions, meatloaf, chicken... I'm already looking forward to returning.
",1
"If you ever live anywhere near Madison, you need to go to this place.  The bar in the stable serves drinks strong and perfectly poured.  Literally anything off the menu is going to burst with flavor.  The Stone House and the Stable Grill both offer really cool experiences; be sure to take a walk through the cool tunnel that serves as a wine cellar and connects the two.I think Quivey's Grove is best enjoyed when you're planning to spend an hour or so at the bar waiting for a table, preferably on one of those cold winter nights where it's so brutal that you can't stand the walk from the car to the restaurant door.  Quivey's practically exists to keep you warm.

"I love being in downtown Phoenix and this was a perfect lunch spot ! I love their other location as well on Camelback.  I'm always happy with their fresh food and great service - another must go if you haven't yet !
",1
"I'll start with the disclaimer that I REALLY like the people that work at this place which is downstairs from my work.  The food is always great quality and if you need a last minute ""gift,"" they have wine and many other goodies to make a  basket (which I have done).The happy hour serves local beers and their house wine is only $3.00 which makes it irresistible for a bargain shopper like me (and it's good too).Stop by and say hello to Ally, Pierce, Gloria and Dave - and rest of the gang.  People are not strangers there for long!

"I love the Duck! Best quality sandwich in town! Yeah they are a little expensive, but if it's good, I don't mind spending the money. Who wants cheap crap No thank you!I swung by on my way home the other day to grab some lunch for the boyfriend and I and I was a little worried about the parking situation.... but I was pleasantly surprised that there was no issue. Lunch in downtown had just wrapped up as it was about 2pm so it was fairly quiet. Pulled into a metered spot, that even had 45 minutes left on it from the last person, THANK YOU!I recommend either the turkey with provolone on a butter croissant OR the pastrami with swiss on sour dough. Make sure to grab some pickles when you check out, they are the best!

"you know that feeling of wanting to try something new and not wanting to settle for good-but-typical restaurants when you're visiting an area This place does the job for a good price.for it being a specialty sandwich shop (i.e. serving duck), it has reasonable prices (~$8.75) for their signature The Duckling sandwich, which is a like a thanksgiving sandwich with roasted duck breast (Turkey + roasted duck breast + cranberry and walnut relish + cream cheese).  MIND BLOWN. their bread is so soft. its like having pillowfuls of flavor in your mouth.fresh ingredients, so good.My friend had the Brieciutto sandwich (prosciutto, brie, sun-dried tomatoes + champagne mustard) the salty from the prosciutto (which, btw, was of excellent quality; not the waxy, can't-chew-through kind of prosciutto) and the sweet from the tomatoes and brie makes it pretty darn good.they also have so many gourmet snacks, bakery items and sweets on the counter, for the after lunch sweet tooth craving to seal it deal. but what I thought was the winner was their selection of bite-size gourmet cheesees (~$1.50 each) for you to sample with your lunch. I got 3: the Marble, triple creme blue, and the Prima Donna Gouda. if you care, here's the verdict: the marble was surprisingly the most pungent of all. triple creme was the winner, it being creamy and just the right amount of oomph. prima donna gouda was meh. fancy cheese without the price tag commitment oh yes pls. p.s. why is it so hard to spell prosciutto correctly
",1
"This is the kind of place that I would visit all the time if I lived nearby. The concept is solid (order what you want and it's written on your brown paper bag, and you pay when they call your name). I chose the spinach salad, which was great quality bacon, feta, and sundried tomatoes on a bed of spinach with a creamy mustard poppy dressing. People were so friendly here, that's what really made it worth it. There were plenty of tables available at noon on a weekday.

"Great tasting food, great service and has been around for years. Presence was a mystery to Me for awhile so maybe an Improvement could be better, more recognizable signage out front or up above. Other than that, it's a hidden gem here in downtown

"Great spot for a quick lunch if you're downtown.  They offer mainly sandwiches,  chips,  soups, Chilli, salads, cookies and coffeeteasoda. For lunch they pack it to go in a lunch sack. If you park in the parking garage of the building they are in they will validate for 2 hours!

"I've been going here since high school, now my kids go too as well as my office and friends.

"When we checked into the Plaza we saw this bar but didn't think anything of it and we weren't sure what it was. The appearance detours the place a bit, as walking by you can't see inside, so by just looking at it and comparing it to all the other bars downtown you wouldn't be able to judge it fairly by just looking at it.As I looked through our coupon book the hotel provided upon check in, there was a 2 for 1 drink coupon inside, and it was labeled the Drink. We weren't sure where the drink was, but decided to go hunting for it. We had to wait for our party to come down, so we made it our meeting point. We asked security where it was and they directed us to the bar we saw earlier.As we walked in and sat at the bar the bar tender was cool and made us anything we wanted. BTW check out the happy hour specials!The place was pretty big and very roomy. There is a good size stage, and a HUGE dance floor. There is also tons of seating. The vibe was sort of Rock n Roll with a taste of modern. A Nice balance.Long story short this place was happening by the end of the night. We felt very welcomed, and ended up staying here all night with our group. All the staff was super cool and friendly. At night a DJ came, he was awesome, and played anything the people wanted, and had a HUGE variety of music.

"Any place that accommodates with a special dietary menu for a little known disease gets five stars from me.  P.F. Chang's has a dedicated Gluten-Free Menu for those of us who suffer from celiac disease.  They also make sure to clean down the area they prepare the specialty dinner so as to avoid cross-contamination.  I don't know many other restaurants that go this far.Aside from the menu preference, I enjoy my overall experience every time.  Their menu is a bit different than that of what most people will be used to if you regularly eat a Chinese Take-Out or Buffet joints.  Don't expect this to be at all like that.  It's not a Buffet.  They don't sell ""General Tso's"" (though Chang's Spicy Chicken is recommended for those looking for something similar, it's my personal favorite) or other signature foods that you may expect.  They do sell very similar items with different names and a few of their own adjustments, just make sure to read the menu description and ask questions if you are not sure.  They also sell Sake, I believe they have a few different types.  The prices can get a bit more expensive than your average Chinese Restaurant depending on what you get but it's well worth it.  Portions are excellent and the taste is great.  I've yet to have one complaint and I have frequented this establishment several times over the span of a few years.The only downside, it can be a little crowded and a bit loud.  It's also very dark because of their lighting.  However, I think it sets the atmosphere.  It can be a romantic place or a casual place, I've been there for both.
",1
"We recently went here for a group dinner with friends.  I am unable to eat gluten and my server (Denice) was knowledgable and brought me special sauces as not to irritate my allergies.  She was amazingly accommodating and when my meal was too spicy (which was totally my fault) she got me something else.  I had the GF beef with broccoli and it was amazing.  She was personable and friendly and went beyond expectations to make sure our table enjoyed themselves.  We were there for a while and were all on separate checks.  I've been to eateries before where that was treated with great disdain.  Never once did I feel unwelcome.  I will go out of my way to eat here again.

"Great food, great atmosphere, little on the loud side but they have turned down the music since the last time we were here so it's much better, good service.

"I will say make a reservation since it's pretty busy on a weekend!  We got seated quickly with a reservation.  Our server was excellent despite how busy it was.  He was also helpful with recommendations and let me sample a couple wines before picking a bottle.  The manager was also great.  We weren't in love with one of the dishes and the manager came out and talked to us about what we were looking for and gave us a complimentary order of what he recommended.  I will say this - they know how to treat their customers. We'll definitely be back :)

"I ordered dinner one day and was very satisfied after my dinner.The food was delicious. I enjoyed it some much I bought lunch there the following day.The is now one of my best places to eat.I would recommend P.F. Chang's China Bistro to everyone.

"Our family loves this restaurant.  My children and I suffer from food allergies.   I have Celiac's Disease and their gluten free selection for a Chinese restaurant is great.  My children are a completely different ball game.  They have a rare disease called Eosinophilic Esophagitus where food attacks their body.  They are very limited on their food selctions due to not being able to consume any food with gluten, soy, eggs, dairy, nuts, tree nuts, fish, shellfish, amd corn.  This restaurant takes special care of my kids by making sure they get chicken that has not gone through the egg wash.  The servers and managers are all trained in how to be careful.  Our favorite manager is Joe and favorite server is Kevin.  Call ahead if you have any questions and they will answer your questions.

"This place hit the spot. Stopped here before a movie and ate at the bar. We got just what we wanted: quick service and some good eats. I recommend the fried green beans with aioli  -- soooo good! Who knew I liked green beans! And this trip I tried some sushi and got the spicy tuna roll. Although it was clearly not pieced together by an expert sushi chef, it was extremely fresh and delish (so who cares if it's not beautiful!)

"This is one of the greatest restaurants I have ever been to and I wish to god I had the kind of wit and vocabulary to accurately reflect the really really REALLY good meal I had here.  As soon as i walked in, I felt really special, which sounds corny and laughably pathetic but I'm not kidding...I felt like one of Angelina Jolie's adopted kids...really special.  The host was a chipper fellow who whisked our coats away and took us to our cozy nook on the second tier in full view of the slate waterfall cascading down the full length of the 3 story restaurant.  I was mesmerized.  Our waitress was a sophisticated, demure lady who catered to our every need and helped us navigate the wonderfully creative menu.We were given yummy complimentary scallop appetizers over baby veggies.  My sister and I immediately looked at each other and knew this was gonna be goodddddd...I would spell out every dish and how friggin' awesome it was but I'll post pictures instead...even the one of me crying at the end of the meal.  Be sure to read the captions...The bathroom was gorgeous showcasing cutting-edge design concepts which had me convinced there was a hidden camera shooting me for the next ""Bold look of Kohler"" commercial (in the non-creepiest way...I do realize I'm talking about hidden cameras in a public bathroom).I might have scoffed at my little sister for going to school in a sketchy place like Pittsburgh, but quite honestly, I just need to shut up and visit her more often.

"Soba Lounge appears to be the only sign of life in Shadyside.  Moderately trendy 20-40 something year old crowd makes the scene, and seem only too happy to make room for you.  Popped in here only for a nightcap after our lousy Taco Bellesque dinner at the Shady Grove and it was the highlight of the evening.  I've been coming here off and on for years, and the espresso martini is my favorite choice, at only $8 per glass!  Comprehensive beverage menu featuring some excellent wines as well as the darling cans of Sofia champagne.  As a matter of fact, this is the only bar that I have seen offer these besides Coppola's restaurant in North Beach.  if you don't know what they are, it's the grown up girl's take on those Minute Maid drink boxes that your mama packed in your lunch, and definitely a girly drink, but a bit pricy at $11 per can.  Next time I return, I plan to dine here and I can see Soba Lounge being my ""Bar away from SF Bars.""

"MMM my hubby and I went there for the first time tonight.  Its probably our new favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh.  After they took our coats, we were seated on the 2nd teir looking across to the waterfall wall... We were there a lil early for dinner (530ish) So we were theonly ones upstairs, it was really nice... and quiet.  Service was wonderful and relaxed. First, ordered the corn chowder, and the lobster maki for starters. I'm VERY picky about sushi, hubby loves it, and he can rarely get me to eat it.  It was delcious!!  I'm actually craving more now that I'm thinking about it.  The corn chowder was also very tastey... but after 3 or 4 bites you're mouth needs some time to cool down!! Its got some kick, but a good kick :)  Ohh, I almost forgot the complimentary appetizer that the chef sent out... I wasn't really listening to her explain it, but it was some sort of delcious hummus on a truffle infused chip... AMAZING.  They should put iton the menu :)  For entrees, I got the pad thai and hubby got the filet.  Both were really good, the filet especially.  Probably one of the best steaks I've had.  Hubby gobbled down the whole thing...  but i had to box up most of my pad thai... I think the sushi and the corn chowder filled me up... ANDi wanted to save room for a dessert.OMG.  We shared the frozen cashew terrine.  Orgasmic.  This will be our new regular place, i think :)

"THE place that I went for a nice conversation + cocktail combo in the 'burgh. Great atmosphere, great drinks, great food. Ahh, Soba. If only all Pittsburgh restaurants could be like you, the world would be a better place.

"A bit on the pricey side, but wow is this place great!Went here with my wife for our anniversary and it quickly has become my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh.  I would go here every week if I could afford it.My favorite of all the Big Burrito places...
",1
"Good beer specials when I've had their beer specials for the night.  Appetizers & entrees are usually perfectly sized, if not a little large.  The one exception is the fried calamari - the plate was probably about twice the size it needed to be!The complementary small-portioned appetizer (I know there's a name for that, but can't think of it off the top of my head) is always been delicious.  The seafood is extremely fresh, and all of the flavors are very good.  Attentive (but not at all annoying) service with friendly waitstaff, nice decor, and a great atmosphere for parties sized from 2 to 20.

"Soba is not only a great lounge but also a great restaurant.  Part of the Big Burrito Group, Soba has a pan-Asian cuisine.  The lounge area is somewhat small, but even when the bar is crowded it doesn't take too long to get a drink.The food is fabulous and the atmosphere in the dining area is anything but crowded.  Multiple floors and an outside deck gives you a number of choices on where to eat.

"A great way to spend the night.  Loved the seafood salad with soba noodles.   Asian cloppino and the filet have never disappointed.  Would love to try everything on the menu.

"I had read about Soba in Pittsburgh Magazine. I was intrigued when I saw that Soba was Numbero Uno according to a recent reader's poll. And doubly impressed that it was listed as one of the magazine's top 25 restaurants in the city. With a build up like that, I was very excited to dine here. We had an early evening reservation. The exterior is described as 3 story Victorian. Looked like a homely dump to me. Inside was a very different story. Sleek and modern, with a Zen like garden feel, we were excited as little kids to be lead to table on the 3rd floor near the bar area. I thought the atmosphere was tranquil and very romantic. I started with the thai corn chowder with crab meat. I was taken aback by the color, a sort of dreary garymustard. But it was very delicious, very spicy. My BBF had a salad that was very flavorful with chicken and fresh spring greens. We were also served an appetizer with cucumber and pita chips. For dinner, we had the filet mignon and the seafood hot pot. The filet was extremely thick and served with a nice vegetable mixture and potatoes.  The flavor was amazing.  The seafood looked delicious, I sampled the shrimp and they were very well seasoned. Dessert was also just as amazing. We shared the vanilla-roasted Asian pear served with a gingerbread biscuit, Asian pear sorbet and sabayon. We also shared a chai spiced creme caramel flan. It was so yummy with pumpkin seed brittle and vanilla chantilly. All in all a very special evening. Everything was wonderfully presented and service was very good.  I have to agree with the readers of Pittsburgh mag.

"This is one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh!  The corn chowder and filet are winners! The service is always top notch and the bar scene is great!

"If you like authentic Chinese food like me, you will love this place. I am actually surprised to see all these negative reasons here.I guess the trick here is that they have both authentic food and Americanized food. I never tried the Americanized dishes but the Chinese ones are decent. I always just order their specials, which are listed on the first page of their menu.My favorite dishes are: Chinese style mapo tofu, Beijing duck (you need to order it ahead), fish with the spicy sauce (The spicy flavor does not just come from the spicy dry red peppers but also sichuan peppers. It has a special tingling flavor and will make you feel like your tongue is on drug.),  and the pork stir fry with bamboo shoots.
",1
"I will say this is as good as it gets for vegetarian Chinese food! Plus they deliver to my apartment.I got the Kong Pao Wheat Gluten & Veggie Lo mein. It wasn't excessively spicy, but enough to make it flavorful. I ordered this for myself....I had a HUGE plate of both with some white rice & a spring roll. I literally still have enough for 2 more meals. With a total of $22.50, it was the best quick & tasty Sunday dinner for a non-meat eater!

"This is my favorite place in the area, and I would eat here everyday if I could. Their vegan options are extensive and amazingly delicious. The won-ton soup is vegan friendly too, at least that's what the server told me. Portion sizes are generous, the soy protein is to die for and the price is right. This place is a little piece of heaven for vegetarians and vegans, but omnis won't know the difference.I've visited this location a handful of times, and each experience has been nothing but pleasant. I have tried the fried mushrooms, the sesame soy protein, the orange soy protein, the sweet & sour soy protein, the wheat gluten veggie mix, the general tso soy protein and the hot and sour soup. My favorite is the sesame soy protein, but I plan to try all of the soy protein dishes at some point. The wheat gluten is tasty, but it's not the best I've ever had. I prefer the meaty and solid texture of the soy protein over tofu and wheat gluten. The spicy dishes are never spicy. You can always ask for extra chile paste like I do though. It's weird that they aren't spicy enough, but that could be because this area isn't as likely to have a preference for the spicy foods. My last visit here on April 1st was definitely the most memorable. The sweetest young male was our server. He forgot sesame on our sesame soy protein, and he apologized profusely and fixed it. He kept bringing us refills, especially on my diet coke. Restaurants can be a little stingy with soda refills, but he was generous. He also gave us free rice refills, and since we all love rice, we were immensely grateful. I can't say enough good things about this kid, but I hope the tip we left him conveyed our gratitude.China Palace is a win for sure!

"My favorite chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh. Clean, flavorful, close in proximity, priced right, friendly service, food comes out quickly, and they're probably the only ones open til 10pm! (since Pittsburgh is the ""city that sleeps""). The only dish I don't like and got confused with is their Walnut Shrimp. In the West Coast, it's glazed with coconut and its supposed to be sweet, but in this restaurant, its salty and does not have any coconut flavor, so I don't order it anymore. And I wish they delivered to the downtown area.
",1
"A good place for Chinese food, the service is good too. Also, the lunch special is a good bargain for a student. The manager is nice. The price (except lunch special) is a little higher than other places, but this is on Walnut St. so this is understandable. The suggestion is to provide more spicy foods (by ""spicy"" I mean really spicy:).

"Yinz don't know what the hell you're talking about, or order the wrong dish. Do yourself a favor order the Lemon Chicken with seshwan* sauce instead of lemon sauce.....Thank my later

"I've been going to Fujo's for the last 5 months or so and I must say that after a long day of work, their seafood su and dragon roll always hit the spot.  They also have Chinese food if you actually want your fish cooked.  And the service is consistently fast and friendly.  Five stars!

"This is the first time I've been here.  First of all the Singapore Noodles was the best I have ever tasted in my life and I've had several.  The waitress was great.  The bus boy literally came around every 5 minutes to make sure everyone had water and he took the dirty dishes away right away.  I don't mind saying I may eat here again tomorrow!

"While staying in Uptown Charlotte we decided on sushi for dinner. Based on a yelp search we looked for a reasonable priced, well reviewed, ready walking distance option from our hotel.  This one is rated with two $$.  Truthfully some of the best sushi I've ever had.  My boyfriend and I split 3 rolls; the coastal roll, panther roll, and the Godzilla roll.  They were not skimpy by any means, there was almost am entire roll left when I had to give up, so the man happily picked up the slack.  I'm only on town for the weekend, so I have no idea if they run specials throughout the week.  I will absolutely come back next time I'm here, and will recommend to my friend who live here and visit here (only 3 hours from home)
",1
"I was traveling for work and stayed at the Hilton so figured I would check Fujo out. Great service and really delicious sushi! The prices were very reasonable and the portions were large. I got a spicy tuna roll (always good) and a volcano roll and they were so good. I also got a rainbow martini, which was yummy. I'll definitely go back when I travel to Charlotte.
",1
"You know what's crazy I've been to this sushi joint like at least 20 times and this is the first time I've actually checked in. I gotta step my game up. Anyhow... Godzilla Sushi Roll is the truth! You can't go wrong, ordering that. I'm seriously stuffed after eating. I mean, the crunchy tempura outside, the savory sauce, the fresh avocado... The ingredients make love in my mouth. Seriously. In my opinion, there's no need to try anything else.Service is spot on. Every time I'm there, everyone is very attentive, and you can't beat the area. I always find a spot to park on 3rd street and when it's nice and warm out; eating outside just makes it all worthwhile. Even if I have to put quarters in the joint to park on a weekday. It's worth it! I go hard for some sushi, especially the Godzilla roll. Get on it!

"i am from Cali; and we love our sushi; was worried that i might never find good sushi while here. This place proved me wrong; great sushi; super quick for call ins and across fom my school; so excited! Might be a weekly place for me!!

"Bought a Groupon here to try it out, and decided to buy another because we knew we'd come back!Go for dinner, sit outside, and enjoy an amazing view of downtown, something you can't really get from many uptown restaurants. Views of many buildings, but set back from the street, just a really great location for evening.Sushi: they have interesting rolls like ones with sweet potatoes that I've never seen any where else. Really yummy sushi of all types.Drinks: really good mixed drinks and sake! Limited wine and beer.Service: Truly excellent!
",1
"I have had a lot of good sushi in Charlotte, but the Godzilla roll at Fujo just completely blew me away.  It is the best sushi I have ever had.  Delicious just doesn't fully describe it.  When the menu says ""Must try"" they aren't kidding.  It is spicy tuna and avocado fried tempura style and topped with special sauce.  The sauce was superb.  The roll is large, so it is a good one to share, but you won't want to because you will want to eat it all yourself.

"Have you ever left a place and thought: What took me so long to get here That happened to me at Fujo's. My girlfriends and I celebrated my birthday here and the sushi and drinks knocked my socks off. Yep, I'm officially a fan! I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for some good and reasonably priced sushi! We started with the steamed pork dumplings. Classic. I also ordered the Rainbow Martini-- it's cranberry vodka, pineapple and midori. The presentation was excellent and they were VERY heavy handed with the liquor.  And there's really just no need to go on and on about just how happy that made the birthday girl! That thing is delicious.But let's get to what everyone wants to know about...the sushi! I ordered the Godzilla Roll and decided after the first bite it's officially my ""go to"" roll when I'm here. I clearly see why it's mentioned in so many reviews and why it's listed as a ""must try"" on the menu. It's packed with spicy tuna, avocado and then deep fried tempura style. My goodness. How could you go wrong with that combination  Do yourself a favor and get over to Fujo's! It's definitely worth a try!

"Oh yea I'm a fan for sho!! So, my better and half and I frequent this place quite a bit!  It's awesome!  Make a reservation, they're always busy!  So for a surprise bday party, they were incredibly accommodating for the 12 people that I had invited and even allowed for me to bring an ice cream cake and borrow their ice box for it!  The waitress was a rock star by far this passed time.  She got every ones order correctly entered and the kitchen rocked it out!  I recommend the curry veggies!  Yum!!!  As far as the bday!  Oh yea, he was surprised and the cake was Epic World of Warcraft..with people coming from around the restaurant to check it out once the kitchen prepped it..  I hear I got some bonus points for this one :)

"This has to be my favorite place to eat.  The food is always consistent and worth waiting for.  I have never had a bad meal here.  I crave the orange peel shrimp occasionally and have to go get my fix!  Their lettuce wraps are the best around.  I've tried them from other restaurants and they don't hold a candle to PF Chang's.  It is very moderately priced and affordable but the ambiance of the establishment gives you the feel of a more upscale and expensive dining experience.  If you haven't been yet you have to try it!
",1
"Our family really loves PF Changs.  In fact, our 11-year-old wanted her birthday meal with the family here.  We really enjoy the happy hour specials, 3p-6p.  We get a little bit of everything off the appetizer menu that feeds a family of four perfectly.
",1
"My husband and I are frequent diners at PF Changs and we genuinely love it.  We typically steer-clear of chain restaurants, but we always make an exception for PF Changs.  We've been going there for years and we have never had a bad meal.  There are some dishes that we like better than others, but we have never had a sub-par dining experience.   The food is consistently good and the service is always excellent.My husband and I dined at PF Changs last night (Saturday night) and we brought another couple with us.  I made online reservations earlier in the day and had no trouble getting the time that I wanted (6:30).   When we arrived, the parking lot was expectedly full so we took advantage of the free valet parking.  The restaurant was very, very busy...there people waiting outside as well.  We arrived just after 6:30 and they had us seated within 5 minutes.  We started with drinks...Blue Moon for my husband, Asian Pear Mojito for me (Delicious!!!!), Bacardi & Coke and Red Wine for our friends.  For appertizers, we ordered Pork Dumplings and Chicken Lettuce Wraps.  When the runner brought the Chicken Lettuce Wraps, he made a comment that the 4 of us shouldn't have to share just one dish...so a few minutes later he arrived with another dish (and more lettuce), on the house.  Very nice way to start off our meal!   To me, it's those types of gestures that kicks PF Changs up a notch or two and we have had a handful of these types of gestures over the years.   The lettuce wraps were hot, fresh, flavorful, and delicious!  The Pork Dumplings were also very tasty!On to the entrees...Tuna Tataki Crisps for me.  They are so excellent!  Round, fried wonton as the vessel, topped with Seared Ahi Tuna topped with diced Ahi tuna, cucumber and scallions tossed in a citrus-sesame soy sauce.  The crisp wonton and the soft tasty tuna are perfect together!  Mongolian Beef for my husband.  This is the best Mongolian Beef that we have found to date.  The sauce is scrumptious, the meat is lean, tender and moist, and the scallions add a nice freshness to the dish.Our friends ordered Orange Peel Chicken and Dan Dan Noodles and they both loved their dishes!For the table to share...Garlic Noodles (my favorite).  I CRAVE these Noodles!  The menu describes this dish as ""Egg noodles tossed with garlic and chili pepper flakes"".  However, that description doesn't do it justice.  The noodles are tender, the sauce is savory, but not too powerful and it has a touch of sweetness, and it's topped with julienned cucumber and fresh Cilantro.  Outstanding served fresh, even better eaten cold (out of the fridge) the next day....if it makes it that long!   I've been known to order an extra to take to a cookout the next day.Pork Fried Rice (my husband's favorite).  Everyone has their fried rice preferences.  For us, we don't like sticky fried rice, we don't like it over seasoned (over salty), and we don't like too many veggies (especially the frozen peas and carrots that most take-out establishments like to use).  Chang's Fried Rice is made with egg, julienne carrots, bean sprouts, sliced scallions, and just the right amount of soy sauce.  Perfect!We completed our meal with a couple of dessert minis...Tiramisu and Lemon Dream.  Both were tasty and just the right size following a big meal.  Excellent meal, once again.  We all left full, satisfied, and happy.  We will continue to dine to PF Changs over and over again.  Yes, we really love it that much.  The dishes may not be ""authentic', but there is something to be said for consistently delicious Asian-inspired food.  For us, PF Changs is the restaurant equivalent of a familiar and reliable friend.  We all have many acquaintances that we enjoy, but the reliable friends are few and far between.P.S. I've posted pictures of the entrees.

"Best service in the world... I ordered my soup and 3 minutes there it was. Me and my family went because we were traveling and it was very close to are hotel. And the waiter was amazing... He was busy but kept our drinks full and cleaned up plates fast and since it was July 4 we asked if he knew any firework shows around and he told us the closest place...

"By far, my favorite Chinese restaurant in Charlotte.  Have been going to Great Wall for the past 12 years and no Chinese place in Charlotte has come close to replacing it.Food has always been good and is always consistent.  From the egg drop soup to the spring rolls to the entrees, everything is great.  I highly recommend the Shrimp and Broccoli, but really everything there is worth trying.Wait staff is very attentive, bordering on too attentive at times.  Food comes out fast and hot.  The owner is friendly and enjoys chatting.Good with large parties, there are two rooms in the back of the restaurant that can be joined or separated depending on the size of your party.

"My family has been coming here for over 20 years and I've always had a great meal. Great specials, diversity, and service. I think this is the best Chinese restaurant in the Charlotte area. The best egg drop soup I've ever had.

"The best Chinese place in Charlotte. (or Rock hill, SC) This restaurant should be tried by people that haven't liked Chinese food in the past because they do it right. My favorite is the beef and mixed vegetables. Ample portions, food (including the rice) perfectly cooked.Make sure (if ordering take out) to ask for some of the ""homemade mustard sauce"" to put on your spring roll or egg roll, it's great but be careful, it's HOT!
",1
"I'm not sure if the folks are reviewing the same restaurant that I have enjoyed since 1985. I live in Florida now but come back to Charlotte 4-5 times a year and the Great Wall is always a must destination. My order is always the same and it is always delicious- Great Wall Special Trio; spicy, no vegetables. Fried Rice and Hot & Sour soup.We have not been able to find good Chinese in North Florida. We would be so happy if we could get Chinese food the caliber of Great Wall!
",1
"If you speak Mandarin, you can request whatever Asian cuisine your heart desires.  Bliss!  Since my Chinese is about as rocky as a kindergarten students', I like to drag my parents with me.  We always order up a storm- not exactly sure how to translate the dishes ordered but I'm sure you get the point.  This is as authentic as authentic gets in Charlotte (even some of the foods on the regular menu).  Absolutely love the owner, the wait staff, and the food.Step out of your comfort zone.  That's how you'll get to experience the authentic.  Junk like sweet and sour chicken is not authentic.  Have fun!
",1
"Been coming here for years. Alex, Tiffany, Cathy and all the staff make me feel welcome. The food is always consistent and good. I generally take out but when dining in, the experience is always good. One thing you must do is spend some time looking at their salt water fish tanks. These tanks are incredible and worth visiting the restaurant just to enjoy them.
",1
"Been coming to the GW for almost thirty years!  Back in 1982 it was one of the few places to eat in the Carmel Commons area.  (Other than Little Ceasars, Mamma Rosas in Pineville & Chucky Cheese).  Yah, I'm old.  I remember when Winn-Dixie was still in Carmel Commons.    Family owned.  SUPER FRIENDLY managers.  Gets busy on weekends.  VERY fast take-out service.Once bumped into Jim & Tammy Baker during lunch. Standard ""American"" Chinese food.  Poo Poo platter fun with the flaming sterno cauldron.  THEY DO HAVE A REAL CHINESE MENU, but you'll need to ask for it.  Bar Area waiting.  Kids love the multiple fish tanks.  Fun place to people watch.  Don't worry if your kid spills fried rice all over the floor.  They won't fret about it.  Always ask for the house made mustard and duck sauce if you're getting take-out.  Bummed Baskin Robbins closed. . .as for years we'd stuff outselves on Beef & Brocoli and then waddle down for a pint of Mint Choc Chip.BE CAREFUL about drinking and driving.  CMPD and even Pineville patrol the area on a regular basis.  Better to get a cab than put yourself in that situation.

"I have been going to Great Wall since 1983. It has always been great and it's the restaurant by which I judge all other Chinese restaurants. It is consistent, reasonably prices, good services and delicious food. The staff is very courteous and I am always well served. If I ever do have a problem, they are more than compliant. Great place.

"I've been going to The Great wall of China South for quite a while. The owner Alex and the staff always accommodate to your liking. I am a pescatarian so I don't know how their meats are however I can tell you about a few of their dishes. My all time favorite dish is one of their specialties the ""Crispy Scallops"". The portion size is very generous & the scallops are sweet. This does not come with any vegetables. I recommend ordering the mixed vegetables with brown sauce. I always tell them to make the sauce spicy :) For appetizers the ""Steamed Veggie Dumplings"" are amazing with a sweet soy sauce. The ""Crab Rangoon"" is okay. The ""Spring Rolls"" are greasy but good. Make sure to have extra napkins. Also I've tried the ""Sa Cha Scallops"" during lunch and definitely a yummy dish! Although I like it very spicy. The restaurant is always clean and they have stayed consistent on everything for many years. Love this place!! Always keeps me coming back

"The BEST Chinese in charlotte. My boyfriend and I are regulars there. The food is amazing and the fish tanks are beautiful. If you are a vegetarian like myself they have plenty of option. I get the mixed veggies in brown sauce, SO GOOD!

"This is one of my favorite places to eat since I was a kid growing up here in Charlotte. We still go there a few times a year as a family when we have a large group together. Great place for birthdays as well. Always seems like the food is consistent and has remained solid over the years. Ingredient quality is much higher than other Hibachi places I have been to. Service is accommodating.  Recently I have been hitting the sushi bar sometimes and we have been very pleased with the nigiri and rolls. We have tried some of the newer sushi places that keep popping up but have realized that we should stick with Nakato's.

"Been a fan of this place since they moved to Pineville from the Independence location. Over the years we gave celebrated many birthdays & anniversaries here . Food is always yummy. You get a lot - so if you leave Hungry - I wonder what's wrong with you ... The appetizer soup and salad are just the beginning - I tend to stay with basic hibachi shrimp and filet which are always wonderful . The fried rice is the all time favorite item for me ! The chef that cooks are generally as entertaining as you want - the more you engage them the more fun it is ! For me - hands down there's no better Japanese steakhouse in Charlotte. Food is fresh - seafood is yummy - entertainment is always good !

"Our favorite dining place to go as a family.  Nakato's is our go to restaurant.  We love the food and hot sake!  Staff is friendly.  Though we love all of the chefs we are partial to (Carlos and Alan).  David the manager is very friendly too.

"Great experience. We went to celebrate my wife birthday.  Everybody had a good time with great meal. Portion on every dish are plenty. About service  excellent. .!

"Great little sushi place worth trying. I'm vegetarian so I can only speak for the vegetarian dishes but its tasty, fresh, and easy.

"I personally rank this place as the best sushi restaurant in town. They don't use msg and its safe for pregnant woman like me. I've tried muramoto, takara, but sushibox was the only place that i could finish my plate.

"I love this place! I wish I could get here more often, but something always comes up when they are open.I love their vegetarianvegan sushi options, it's quite impressive when compared to all the other places in Madison...Sushi Box has more than the standard choices that every place in Madison has. This is the best place in town for sushi.

"Sushi Box has been consistently great!! I love the small space and the owner is very friendly. Most of the sushi is very affordable. We will continue to be regular customers =)

"Love this spot. Great food, easy going setting. Come as you are! Owner is super sweet. Been here nearly a dozen times, and it is consistently good. Yum!

"Wow. I've been reading the other reviews and I'm honestly shocked.  I've been coming here since it first opened and no one knew anything about it.  I liked it better when it was small and unknown, but that's because I could enjoy it at my leisure.  The owner would often come out and chat up the customers and the business in a house was a fairly new phenomenon.The food has been consistently tasty and fairly priced. The only thing to change over the years is the architecture and decor.  I've taken all sorts of people here to eat and no one has ever disagreed that it was the best Chinese food.I have always had at least adequate service on First Fridays.  The rest of the time, the service is as wonderful as the food.

"I heard about this guy Sarah K. went out with on 1212. They didn't quite click, but he sounded up my alley. We totally hit it off and had all kinds of romantic dinners and wild nights. Then we got married and made tons of babies and they all grew up to become supreme court justices. This is how I feel about Fate.
",1
"I don't know what else I can say that hasn't already been said about Fate, but here goes. The food at Fate is like a warm spicy Asian orgasm on a plate. The martinis send me to another level of heaven. Johnny Chu is a genius and  I will cry if he ever leaves Phoenix.I think that about covers it.
",1
"I was actually pretty shocked to see any negative reviews for Fate on here.  The whole bun scenario listed a few reviews down sounds like a fiasco, but thankfully i've never had a negative experience there, and i've been there god only knows how many times.Fate is my favorite restaurant.  i discovered it late one night (well, early morning, actually) after helping a friend shoot a burlesque show downtown.  I was amazed that they were open that late (I think it was one...maybe two A.M.).  He insisted that I'd be amazed, and I was.  I have had to wait a few times to get in, but usually that was because it was First Friday.  It's understandable, because it's a small place (like most of the places downtown), and it's pretty popular.  Besides, you can always call ahead and make a reservation if you don't want to wait.  It's not a big deal.  The service the first time and each subsequent visit was excellent, and the food was brought out ridiculously fast.  The crab puffs are to die for, and I honestly have trouble narrowing down which martini is the best.  The pad thai martini is just amazingly weird enough to be good, but the spicy cucumber is out of this world.  I've tried a number of dishes, but I always come back to the spicy Saigon with shrimp.  I'm glad I don't live nearby, or I'd go there all the time.  This way it's always a treat when I go.
",1
"I love Fate! LOVE it. I love Fate so much, sometimes I want to take it behind the school and get it pregnant!Their green tea milk is AMAZING. I go cuckoo for it. For reals! Their little mushrooms are so good too. Oh my god, they are like little mini mushrooms. If keebler elf's, harvested mushrooms, these would be it! So good! If it's your first time, trust me: get the crab puffs, grab yourself a cool refreshing hulk-alishist Green Tea Milk, and go for the Hong Kong flat noodles. So good! And what about those little wafer cookies they give you at the end They are like air! But better! (...they have calories...maybe they are not like air...but in a perfect world Like Air!)

"This is by far my favorite restaurant ever.I have been coming to Fate for about five years now and never ONCE have I been disappointed with the food or the atmosphere. We are normally pretty lucky and we get Heather who is SUPER sweet and a great waitress. I see reviews about people complaining about the hostess. Yeah, they can be snobby and make life difficult but it is SO worth it.I would 100% recommend the hot and sour soup. It is amazing. Unfortunately I recently found out it has SHRIMP POWDER so I cannot eat it any more. Another tasty veggie friendly appetizer is the tofu wedges. They come with an amazing peanut sauce.I have had several entrees, but always come back to the Hong Kong Flat Rice with fried tofu. It is so amazing. Garlicy sauce. They have really amazing yellow curry too. They might put brown sugar in it because it is a little sweet, but perfectly so.The portions are always great, and you honestly CANNOT beat the atmosphere. It is an old house in the historic district turned restaurant and they display artwork from local artists. Stay away during artwalk though, or you will have to wait forever for a table. They are open really late on the weekends too.At least give Fate a shot once. If you don't like it I will let you punch me in the gut.
",1
"I must say Fate was the only positive thing I gained from an otherwise awful date. The food was fantastic. I had the green chicken curry. It had the perfect mixture of spices and it was not too spicy for a curry dish. I wasn't  expecting the curry sauce to be creamy. The sauce had a light green split pee hue, but despite the odd color the flavor was amazing. The meals were fairly priced. I believe my dinner was around the same price as my first drink...$10.00-$12.00. I enjoyed the artistic ambiance. The staff was polite and our food and drinks were delivered to us promptly. I have read other reviews about the hostess's being rude...luckily I haven't experienced that. Even if I had e negative staff experience I would still recommend Fate for the food alone.

"Yes!  This place was soooo good.  Several veggie options... delicious Yakisoba.  I'm looking forward to trying out their sister-restaurant, Eastwind.Went on a Saturday night and it was VERY busy.  I can't wait to go back, just not during peak hours.
",1
"This place has the best vegetarian sushi roll in town as well as overall good food. Service alters from unbelievably excellent to non-existent.
",1
"After reading the reviews, I just had to check out the Cherryblossom Noodle Cafe.  I was not disappointed...What a crazy little place!  I went with my brother and a friend.  I had the yakisoba (noodles with vegetable and sauce), my brother had the Udon noodle soup with tofu, and his friend has the tuna.  All three were such different dishes yet were all wonderful.  We couldn't stop raving about the flavor.  Who knew noodles could be so magical or tofu so flavorful!The service was actually quite wonderful.  Our waitress helped guide us to the meals we would like.  She also brought us the cool appetizer bread basket...banana bread, little cinnamon toasts, and rolls.  She also helped up each pick a desert :)Just an odd little place, Japanese and Italian noodles in a restaurant with plenty an Eiffel Tower decoration and a bright red British phone booth  Check it out :)

"My husband & I are addicted to Cherryblossom's ramen. Mr. T is Japanese & I lived in Japan for 4 years, so take my word it's authentic.The mix of foods is not so strange if you're familiar with restaurants in Japan. The ramen is Hakata style, made with a pork broth & may be heavyoily for some people, so why not please everybody Be sure to ask for ""Cha Shu Ramen"" to get a few more pieces of pork. (extra $)The salads are also fantastic; warm lightly fried (10)Shrimp on a fresh spring mix base with mango dressing,  Shanghai Duck salad, and the Chicken Caesar was perfect, not heavily dressed like some ""roadhouses."" Mr. T & our daughter loved the Eggplant in Miso Sauce, & even the California Roll was good.It's said Japan took the best of each country's cuisine. So there are French pastries, German beer, Italian pasta, and Indian curries. Save the banana bread for dessert if you can, or get one of their pastries. I've never have enough room.If you like good WHITE bread, buy one of the Pullman loaves on the table by the front door. My first extra 20 pounds in Japan came from the good bread! (No whole grain breads were available 30 years ago!)I think it's too small for groups over six.Maybe we'll see you there.Added 111807I think that their menus are not all alike, so if  ramen isn't on the menu you receive, you can still order it. (It's posted in Japanese on the wall.) For the basic, ask for ""Hakata Ramen."" For extra pork, ask for ""Cha-shu-men"" or ""Cha-shu-ramen.""Either way, there's really not much pork in it. That's why you need a delicious shrimp or duck salad.

"You know how everyone has that go-to place to take visiting friends and other out-of-town guests...this is mine.  I've taken my sister and her boyfriend, my cousin and her boyfriend, several other couples, and they've always LOVED this restaurant.Located in an unassuming little stripmall on Camelback (because creative contemporary architecture no longer exists in Arizona), the Cherry Blossom Noodle Cafe is so tucked away, you'd never know it existed.  Even if you did, you'd never know it was so damn good.Any how, a friend introduced me, and I am in love with this place for the following reasons:1. QUALITY.The food is ALWAYS excellent.  I've never had anything bad here and it's always fresh and tasty.  2. VARIETY.My boyfriend and I love this place because he can get REAL Chinese and I don't have to eat forture cookies and water.  The theme is noodles, so we encompass all Asian varieties and Italian as well.  They also have other Asian options such as a Japanese bento-box, sushi, edemame, etc.  It's weird that they come to your table with bread and they latter on you're eating tempura...but that's the appeal.  Great desserts too!3. AMBIANCE.I always describe it as Tokyo Disneyland.  It's like a Japanese take on European provincial.  There's a nice brick facade inside, nice fixtures, big, solid-hunk-of wood rustic tables, filagree metal light fixtures, etc.  It's just pleasant and romantic.4. STAFFThey've got that perky-Japanese thing down, even the non-Asian wait staff.  They're always smiling and helpful.  The girls are cute and perky. They're always just really nice people.So, come to the Cherry Blossom.  You can bring out-of-town friends and maybe convince them that that Valley isn't all Mexican or big-boxchain places.  BTW, since the place is small and intimate, small double-dating size groups are good, but this is no place for massive groups.

"Mmmmm....Korean Spicy Beef at it's finest! Their appetizer breads are fantastic as well.

"I got to do the ordering tonight... and it was a fabulous meal at CherryBlossom Noodle Cafe! I have never seen a restaurant that is so eclectic... you have traditional noodle dishes, both hot and cold, from Japan, along with Sushi; pasta dishes from Italy, and some items from SouthEast Asia! There is more than enough diversity in their menu to satisfy the most discriminating palate. Despite their diversity, CherryBlossom Noodle Cafe does not stray from the basic tenant of Japanese Cuisine: food items are never too salty or too sweet, and are never bland; you can call it cooking subtlety.For starters I ordered a California Summer Roll (Vietnamese) for my friend and myself. Unlike the Vietnamese Summer Roll spiced with mint, and usually accompanied by a lime dipping sauce; CherryBlossom's version was accompanied by a sauce comprised of sweet Sesame Seed  Soy Sauce dip. A Summer Roll contents include Shrimp, Rice Vermicelli, Crab strips, and Cabbage wrapped with a thin Rice Paper ""tortilla"". Anyone used to the Vietnamese version will see CherryBlossom's as probably a little bland... but you have to remember the philosophy behind Japanese cooking.My friend also had Miso Soup with his meal. Unlike the soup yesterday evening, he said the Miso Soup was very good.With every meal, you will also receive a bread basket ( http:cherryblossom-az.comcherry-bread.gif ). The basket contains three types of breads: a soft and warm French Roll; a slice from a dark and sweet Blueberry bread; and a crispy Butter Biscuit. There is enough variety in texture from all the breads to satisfy anyone.Main dishes...I ordered for my friend Grilled Orange Roughy. The Orange Roughy was grilled to perfection and was accompanied by a sweet and salty dipping sauce concoction. Sides consisted of Japanese sticky rice.I ordered for myself the Beef Nanban Soup with thin Soba (Wheat) Noodles, rather than the Udon Noodles, accompanied by a bowl of Japanese Sticky Rice. My friend does not drink, but I ordered the Rasperry Fruit Punch, a very good drink made from Raspberry Wine with Fruit Punch... essentially a Raspberry Wine Cooler (but stronger). This drink also had an umbrella ""thing"" spearing a whole strawberry! Very good and refreshing!I had my usual coffee after the meal which surprised me a little... an Amaretto laced coffee was brought out. The aroma was very enticing! Would make a coffee drinker out of anyone!100% of capacity, with 30% Asian; 20% Hispanic; rest Caucasian. First time I've been to a restaurant that was packed with NO seats left! A very popular spot!CherryBlossom is very heartily recommended so long as you remember the tenets of Japanese Cuisine... no extreme flavors... nothing will be extremely spicy, salty or sweet. This makes it easy to grab a little from this dish, and something from that dish without disrupting the flavor of either.There was something that was a little disconcerting, though... The state of the men's room. For such a highly rated establishment, it seemed like no one had checked on the men's room for about two to three hours... toilet paper thrown around, stains around the wash basin. Nothing really objectionable, but a little surprising considering the number of staff for such a small establishment. This establishment has to be aware that a restaurant is judged by it's back-room as well as it's front room. Won't take anything off... but it is highly noticeable considering...And the diners of CherryBlossom has to share the same restrooms with Tokyo Express (right next door), both of the businesses are probably owned by the same management group. The interesting tidbit is that we both spent MORE for a worse meal last night at Bamboo House... AMAZING! My friend said his dishes from the Summer Roll to the Grilled Fish was some of the freshest tasting dishes he ever had; good compliment from him. In fact, he wanted to go back to CherryBlossom the next evening... but this is my last night here in the Phoenix area.... sigh....(I really think everyone is reviewing CherryBlossom under the wrong spelling.... It's CherryBlossom, not ""Cherry Blossom"". Take a look at their sign or their website.)

"This place is good.  Really good.  I give it the 3 C's: casual, cute and relatively cheap.  Its a great place to go if everyone your eating with can't decide on what to eat... Pasta  Check.  Soup noodles  Check.  Sushi  Check.  The chicken parm and salmon pastas were delicious!  Can't wait to go back!
",1
"If you can get past the worn exterior, you are in for a treat.  This is easily one of my favorite restaurants in all of Phoenix, and I often made the trip down from Peoria to eat here.  The menu is very extensive to say the least... I was very impressed by their hard-to-find fusion items, such as Ika Mentaiko pasta (squid with spicy cod roe).  If you have an eclectic appetite, I recommend you come here!  Though I've never tried any of their more typical Italian offerings, their sushi and Asian noodle dishes are delicious!  They've also got an assortment of interesting cocktails--Saketini, anyone

"It's yet another Michael's, and it's a very good one. Recommended always. For those who love crafting, Michael's is a godsend.
",1
"I come here pretty frequently for art and craft supplies. Whatever Michaels doesn't have I just order online from a different retailer. Some items are pricey but you can still find some good deals. If you go all the way to the back of the store you can find interesting clearance items. Customer service is average. My favorite time to visit Michaels is when summer is about to end and all the fall and Halloween items are set out. Since I come here often, I know where everything I need is. However, the store could use a new layout.

Are you looking for -a selection of stuffed ratssunglasses shaped like martini glasses or dollar signs or heartscheap Pittsburgh mugs or magnetsIC Light or Steelers merchandiseold fashioned candyparty hatsOk, you get the idea. This store is STUFFED full of all kinds of things that you will suddenly absolutely need and it's reasonably priced. It's also the perfect place to buy some junk to take home to your friends :)

"This is always one of my favorite stops when visiting the Strip. A wide variety of party favors and Pittsburgh paraphernalia.

"This is SUCH  fun store!  I mean, what place can you go into, buy a Steelers mug, a candy necklace and some plates and napkins for a party  Want Pittsburgh themed merch  They've got it!  Need party supplies  They've got it!  Need a bouncy ball  They've got it!  You really need to step in here to get the full picture of everything they have to offer....because, it's basically everything!  I've come in here looking for one specific item and walked out with twenty non specific items.  That's just how it goes here!  Seriously, if you're throwing a themed party, looking for unique gift or need Steelers merchandise, this is the place for you because you'll more than likely find it...and walk out with more than you planned on getting!  But that's the fun of shopping here!

"I freakin' love this place. Anything you could possibly want, they've got it. And probably a lot of stuff that you don't want. I loved that everyone listed the crazy things they've seen there - they have all of that and so much more. 2 gems a friend got while we were there: a giant bottle of sriracha sauce & a fake tattoo sleeve. Ha!!All I got was a postcard, this was the only place I found in the Strip District that sold them. Will definitely be back, and will remember to leave plenty of room in my suitcase next time!

"This is a great little store.  I walked right in off the street and asked if I could have scraps of silk, wool, cotton, leather and polyester.  I was met with a ready smile and whisked through the store where one of the workers was gracious enough to assist me and cut small swatches of fabric from the rolls.  This store looks well stocked and I really appreciated getting the small swatches for free.  This location made it very easy for me to find what I was looking for. Thank you so very much Gene Sanes Upholstery.
",1
"My mom called me so giddy on the phone today, I thought she was going to tell me she won the lottery.  No.  Her sofa from Gene Sane arrived.  It made her just as happy.  She and I went to Gene Sane a few months ago and found fabric for a sofa and chair.  The fabric was not inexpensive.  Some of that they have is really beautiful designer fabric, some of it is not so special and I am convinced could be found elsewhere for less.  However, they did have excellent customer service throughout the entire upholstering process.  And my parents ended up getting two sofas and three chairs done there.My parents live in Oakland in a condo building with a ridiculously small elevator.  Gene Sanes went above and beyond to make sure this extremely long sofa from my grandma would fit in the elevator at my parents' building.  They brought the sofa mid-upholstery to the building just to make sure it would fit into the elevator.  That is such great customer service it is ridiculous.  It did fit, which is great, but their backup plan was to upholster it as two pieces which would then seamlessly be fit together as one inside the apartment.  This is the kind of stuff that high end places in NYC know how to do and even though they ended up not having to do it in this case, it was good to know they have the skills to do so.  They were also great with attention to detail of lining up all the stripes on all the cushions both front and back.  These are the kinds of things that make a big difference.
",1
"Gene Sanes remade boat cushions for our 28' sailboat interior.  Incredible craftsmanship and attention to detail. The cushions are beautiful. They also made coordinating curtains and throw pillows. Delivered on time (actually 1 week early) and very accommodating to my family who helped pick up the cushions in two waves. Thank you!!

"I love love love this store. It's a mecca of kooky gifts, books, cards, calendars, tshirts, jewelry, candles... pretty much everything you could ask for. I've spent over an hour just browsing, and around the holidays or birthdays, it's the best place to go if you have no idea what to get. You can pick up anything from a barista action figure to chocolate body paint to the complete set of Harry Potter hardback books. And don't forget the fizzy bath salts or the stick-on mustaches. You'll be hard pressed to NOT buy anything before you leave.
",1
"Despite the kooky spelling, Kards Unlimited is a great place to shop for a gift. The card selection is extensive, so if you go there in search of a card you're unlikely to head home empty-handed. Even better, there's a wide assortment of knick-knacks and books that are perfect as gifts or impulse purchases for yourself. It's easy to lose track of time as you wander up and down the narrow aisles.
",1
"Such a great store. They stock everything (EVERYTHING), including: cards, hand puppets, necklaces, books, etc... Kards Unlimited seems to take great care in choosing store products for sale. Definitely my favorite store on Walnut.

"I regret to say that I have walked past this store for four years and never went in. That's four years of gifts that I could have found in one place. The books, staionary, gift wrap, and kookyfun gifts are all instant inspiration. They have way too many things to classify the store or its demographic, but if you need something unique and have no idea of what it is just go in and look around. You'll find it.

"Probably THE best card and gift store in the East End of Pittsburgh, if not the entire city.  Even the picky and indecisive card shopper (such as myself) can find plenty of good choices.  Need a present to go along with that card  You can make a one-stop trip to Kards Unlimited.  There are toys for both kids and adults, gag gifts like beer goggles, books, bath and body products, ornaments and what is my favorite to look at, funky jewelry.  If you're shopping for a literary friend, a bunch of the paper collage-style necklace pendants incorporate literary references (Why, yes, I would like one!).  Even if you're not shopping for a lovable female book nerd, the jewelry is beautiful.The aisles can get cramped with people browsing, but you can't blame them--there's just so much to see.
",1
"They have a huge selection of greeting cards in the back, but I've usually come here to browse the books (lots of Kurt Vonnegut) or the stationary and other gifts like that (notepads like ""While you were out"" but with snarky commentary). Not only do you have a ton of options here, but they're very well curated options. One of the very best gift shops around!
",1
"Much more than just a card shop. A very unique store. Tons of pop culture stuff. Take your time and look around.

"I have to stop myself from stopping here once a week and stocking up on cards I don't yet need. Great card selection and perfect for gift shopping, they literally have something for everyone.  I go at least as often as I need a card for some occasion and they always have new things. A bit expensive but worth it to support this great store.

"A door sign reads ""hiring enthusiastic, energetic and humorous employees"" , so I walk-in. Immediately my expectations are exceeded as a lady behind the desk responds to a radio call from the staff upstairs announcing that her radio (which is strapped to her body) vibrates every time someone calls her and she ""kinda likes it"". I couldn't help but laugh out loud the first 30 seconds I walked through the door. Super savvy, humorous and fun: This is one novelty shop you don't want to pass up! I left with unique childrens books & hand puppets for my son, silly sticky notes for my secretary's desk, witty comic novels, and an irresistible coin pouch. It's more than shopping in here, it's a whole experience. Go in, get lots for awhile...

"One of the few non-people I have purposefully sought out and ""liked"" on Facebook, Kards Unlimited has the highest quality and variety of cards I've ever seen. Plus wacky tees. Plus random crap usually found in gift shops at the airport, only with infinitely more edge and non-bloated prices. I always stop in for a visit when I'm wandering around Walnut and I rarely leave empty handed.

"Somehow amid 18 credits both semesters of my senior year, I also managed to find time to do a whole lotta scrapbooking.  And this place pretty much carries everything and anything you need.  Printed papers, solid papers, pens and markers and pencils, stickers, die-cuts, acid-free adhesives, scissors, punches, and a great selection of albums.  I think they have classes, too, but being the *expert* scrapbooker I am (brushes hair off shoulder), I never checked those out though I'm sure they're a lot of fun.  Their workroom is well-stocked, and (*nerd alert!*) it is really fun & satisfying to lock yourself in a space like that with all the necessary tools and make an entire scrapbook in an evening or afternoon.Middleton is really close to Madisonthe UW Campus and convenient to get to.

"I am so absolutely disappointed that Pegasus closed! The name has been around for so long and many people know of it, even if they've never stepped foot in it. Pegasus was an amazing barclub to go to to dance, socialize and roam their 3-4 floors. The dance floor was spacious and there were so many places to go if you grew tired of dancing! I never had one bad night at Pegasus! Every night there was an amazing adventure! The staff was great and the people there were so much fun! I met some great people there and the crowd was almost always friendly and fun. I really hope that Pegasus comes back because Pittsburgh needs it!

"I can't find a complaint about this place.  Drinks are reasonable.  Only ever seems to be a $1 cover.  Couches for lounging.  Pool table.  Room for dancing if you want to (no one hardly seems to).Staff is super friendly.  During Pride it is a place you can stop into to get a drink cheaper than the beer tents outside.

"Hold up, time for an update on the review.  Still five stars, yes, but let me expand on it more than my two tiny paragraphs I had prior.Since I was there last they have done a remodel, a great remodel.  It doesn't feel so enclosed now.  Amazing what a bright color of paint on the wall and some new flooring can do for the way a place feels inside.  Also, big props for finally getting rid of the blinds on the only windows you have in the place (I have a feeling you used them to hide your embarrassment).  New floors and paint are not the only thing that was done for this remodel.  Remember those scary bathrooms  Yeah, no more.  They have nice, CLEAN bathrooms now.  The one thing that baffles me is the sink outside the bathrooms.  One sink.  Between the men's and women's bathroom.  Air dryer, no towels...weird, but it works.Another great thing was that they moved the pool table to the back.  To me, it felt like they were deterring you from entering on some nights.  I mean what would you think if you walked into a dim lit bar and saw some guys standing there with pool cues  With the moving of the pool table, it really does open it up at the front, more inviting if you will.Staff are still as nice as can be.  Polite and accommodating.$1 cover on most nights to walk in the door.  Yes there is a $10 minimum if you want to use  your card.*if you like karaoke, they have an odd little twist on it every first Thursday of the month.

"The drinks are cheap and the music is pretty good depending on the DJ that night. Its not that expensive to get in, either. I guess you can kinda say I'm a regular... its the only club that I have fun at and the crowd is never rude - drunk of course especially on free draft beer night but never rude in my opinion. hahah  Its a nicely sized place. I've had waaay too much fun at this club!! They have three bars in total (one in the main room right by the big dance floor), one in 'Divas', and another upstairs when they have that open. If you wanna get some air they have a nice outside patio too.Lately I do have to say that the drag shows that I have seen have been kiiiinda boring to be honest but that's not what I normally go there for unless they have special guests.  Reading the comments I realize people are all like 'this place is shady' and, yeah, kinda is but I don't expect something fancy unless its downtown. *lol*The only thing I don't like is the creepy straight dudes that show up and lurk around, especially on Fridays. They really don't take a hint. But that's with every club in my experience, sadly. xD And in my opinion Scorpio is kinda more-so for the guys. I'm a queer female and I find it hard to spot the girls who aren't just their for their gay bf. I've gone on every day they are open but Saturday - my friends say the crowd can be kinda ghetto.House liquor is free on Sundays, free draft beer on Wednesday. Other specials are normally only 3 bucks which is good in my book!  I read on another review that the drinks were weak but like every bar if you tip them well your bartender will treat your right.  If your looking for something fun to do with no frills and no pretentious people this is the place.

"wednesdays and sundays are the best nights i think..ive been going to this club since i was 18, now 35... its a guaranteed good time! :) they have great specials on some nights its all you can drink draft, sometimes its all you can drink well drinks or vodka...with admission of course, which has almost always been $10... if you love drag queens check out sunday nights, its the most fun! :) djs have changed over the years, i dont know who is the dj now but i know there will always be some good music to dance my a** off to. :) been going here for years and will probably go for many many more. proud this is one of the oldest gay clubs in nc! :) go scorpio!

"We love the Cash. It is one of the few bars that have a smoking patio that you can drink on.We have donated a lot of stuff to raffle off for charity events at the Cash. They always have a great turnout.The crowd is extremely diverse. The drinks are good and cheap, and the bar staff is very friendly.

"No matter your persuasion, there are good times to be had here.  The people watching is spectacular and everyone is super friendly... just watch out for the 70+ year old (!) tranny who looks just amazing, because she will drag your unwilling ass onto the dance floor to teach you to two-step!

"This is a great place to have fun.A great variety of music, mostly country, but good dancing country from the two step, to the ""neon moon"" song dance (cuz I don't know the name of that dance. lol), to coordinated dances to certain songs, and then just shaking your bootay to Madonna or something like that.Nice big dance floor and a good amount of seating.Smoking area out the side doors that's new where you can bring your drinks... nice touch since that new law came in.Bartenders are really nice and the drinks are strong.  The draft beer seems to get you drunker than normal for some reason... not sure why.Great place even to bring straight people... my friends always seem to have a blast when they go.Just really needs better parking. But that's not too much of an issue.

"Considering the fact that San Diego cannot support a lesbian clubbar, I was VERY impressed with this unpretentious place! We showed up on a rainy Friday night, place was a hoppin! A little bit o' butch, a little bit o' femme, a few trannys sprinkled in as well as some music and a great and active dance floor. I despise country music- but it sure was fun watching these folks do a little two step and beyond (damn, they were good!). They did also play a little hip-hopTop 40 to mix things up. Didn't spot any attitude here, everyone was friendly, smiling, laughing and having a good time, ourselves included!

"Only been in once but I loved it, this bar was one of the factors on moving down to this area. You will see me there alot. love the people and how nice the employees are. Both indoor and outdoor seating. I came from seattle and this bar is way better than any of the lesbian clubs on Capitol hill.

"I have to say, for us ladies who love ladies, there aren't many options for bars.  That being said, I think the Cash is pretty swell.  They aren't trying to be something they're not (ZGirl club, take notes!), they're not pretentious and there's never a waitcover to get in.  The bartenders are chill and remember you even if it's been a long time.  I love Kat and the other bartender (name unknown to me) with the lovely silver hair who always asks ""what'll it be, babe"".  The music isn't exactly my style, but they do throw a few booty-shakers in amongst the country ballads.  I love watching the dance floor, as most of the ladiesgentsothers know how to cut a rug.  They have a large outdoor patio for the folks who enjoy smoke and the drinks are cheap:)  Love what you do, don't change a thing!

"My new favorite bar in Phoenix! Dress anywhere from Casual to Fancy and you fit in. Two step, hip hop, slow dancing, line dancing. They have everything. The bar tenders are incredible and take care of you well! TIP EM BIG!!

"Trying very hard to be unbiased since this is my Saturday night spot for a year and a half now. The bar: I enjoy the employees attitude, the new country with some top 40, cupid shuffle, some throwback songs, and fairly priced drinks in this decent sized dive bar. For smokers, there's a large back patio area. An ATM is available in the darts room. Parking is in front, the back, or at Food City. The Cash has supported charities, held drag shows, and threw themed nights, like the most recent black out party, and  they also host poker games, dance lessons, and of course, karaoke. For busy nights, they have 3 bar tenders serving, 2 in the front and 1 in the rear. The crowd: If you're visiting or new transplant, compared to flashy Los Angeles, hipster Seattle, and melting pot NYC's lez scene (to name a few cities), I've noticed that this place has lots of butch lesbians, about an even number of femmes, tomboys, androgynous, and a small handful of ultra femmes. For the most part everyone's friendly. You'll see a wide age range here, along with some straights, gay boys, etc. I've also noticed a trend.... the Cash's bathrooms are never nasty and are always stocked with TP and paper towels lol.Come by, grab a drink, get your 2 step on, or twerk and grind, or just wiggle around... at The Cash, the Cheer's of Phoenix's lesbian population, and have a great time :)

"The first time I went to Karamba's it was for Pride. I went for after hours and it was amazing! I paid my $5 cover fee and went into what looked like an industrial style bar. There were tables being hung from the celing and there were also a backdoor to the outside patio as well as a the ladies restroom. When we went deeper into the club, the blue hued bar gave way to the deep red dance floor. There were tables for dancing on as well as a plush looking chill section. The dance floor was PACKED with men grinding up on men, with women griding up on women and the ocassional straight couple peppered into the crowd as well as a few large groups of women dancing together. Oddly enough there's often a lot of straight women who go there with their bffs so they can dance in peace. There's some chairs and more hanging tables surrounding the dance floor. Then there's the outside patio... there's a few water foutains and a ton of patio chairs, benches and tables. Sometimes it feels like the patio is where the real party is at! Since that weekend, I've been a regular there. I'm sure if you venture there for afterhours some Friday or Saturday night you'll see yours truely tearing it up on the dance floor to some of the hottest hip-hop and reggeton around! If you do, pull me away from my friends and say hi! Hope to see ya'll there!

"GREAT music and tons of fun! LOVE the music!! Fridays is mainly for ""cheros"" akaguys that wear pointy boots with matching belts as they play that kind of music. Notreally my thing but can be fun if you got your buzz going. Saturdays is hip hop,reggaeton, and house music which is the main day it gets POPIN!  After 2 it turns 18and over-never really stayed after 2am so don't know how that it. NOTE: Karambas is not a place to go looking for guys or a dress to impress kind ofplace.  It kind of reminds me of a club I used to go to in Juarez except with alot moreeye candy.  The atmosphere is very fun and people don't really go there to mingle itsmore of a place to with your friends and have a good time without having to impressanyone.  From experience usually the people who don't like going here are the people who are looking for someone else or sad to say ugly lol not to be rude but its true.Bathrooms: Yea they're kinda small but um im there to party... if your worried about thebathrooms LMAO please don't go out or maybe drag a urinal with you.  Prices: People say their over priced but honestly i thought they were cheap... if yourhard up for cash look extra sexy so a cute Latino will buy your drinks for u duh!

"It doesn't matter what anybody says about dance night clubs, you have to see for yourself because this club is absolutely incredible they have an amazing sound system and laser light, this is definitely where I would want to be on the weekend if I'm looking for a dance club. This club is so good it has received the best of Phoenix Award several years in a roll, none of the Latino dance clubs have survived only this club because the owner knows what he's doing and provides great music and entertainment you have to go stop in and see this place if you're looking for a Latino club this is really the only place in Arizona to go.  Also the club has a food taco stand outside which is good and also an amazing outdoor patio that's absolutely beautiful it also has there are areas in the club that are sort of tucked away where you can sit with friends and drink and have a really great time. I am LMAO at all these little young tweakers who are posting bad reviews because they had a bad time give me break they have no clue what a really good dance club is all about, and their one time bad experience has nothing to do with the quality of a club. Maybe if they weren't so high they could have enjoyed the club lol.

"Phoenix's best bar!  Everyone is welcome. Bored with the usual, join the interesting set at C7. Friday night's drag show starts about 10:30 and Daveena Ross is an elegant hostess. Bring $1s to help them fund college or make-up. If you like clones, stay away. If you like humanity, come on down!

"I haven't had a night out like this since Living in SF. These ladies had so much vibrance and personality! The show started slightly after 10:30 and I went in on a Friday to celebrate a friends birthday it was worth the wait! Drinks were cheap but the performance was not. The dive bar ambiance gave it a very comfortable feel, don't expect anything fancy except from the ladies. Small parking lot but lots of places to park nearby though! Kudos to the staff! We had a great night :)

"Plazma Rocks! Best place in CenPho to grab a spot at the bar, patio, or table. I say that cause there is always room. It's a shame the place is rarely packed, because this very cool neighborhood bar has a lot going for it.Great bartenders! A supper friendly owner, and the best drink prices north of Van Buren. There is always a drink special and lots to look at with all the TV's and music Videos, a few old school Pinball machines, darts, a big stage and a pool table.I like going for some of the drag shows, this is the type of place with newbies and the old standards like Celia, Miss Ebony, and Phedra.I think ther is karaoke a few times a week and strippers on Saturday nights, I have to get back for that. On my last visit we were shocked because even though the parking lot was empty there was a fun lively crowd inside. We found out that alot of people walk over from around the hood, and from the huge uber-gay apartment complex next door.I dont live close enough to walk and I dont drink and drive so I dont get in as often as I would like to, but the last time I was there was 5 Stars! Thanks guys for making me feel welcome.jv

"Had such a great time here. Plazma has a dive bar feel (as least when I went). Cocktails were cheap and strong.

"We had planned on going to the Rhythm Room, which is directly across the street, but they were still charging a full cover at midnight, and just wanting to have a late-night cocktail, we took our hard-earned cash to Friends.  Just as we walked in, a drag show was ending, which was a treat.  Only wishing we had gotten there sooner, we sat down and ordered drinks.  I was amazed at the selection of flavored vodkas and other booze they have.  Not feeling too adventurous in that area I ordered a Ketel One Citroen on the rocks.  Generously poured, I don't remember the price, but I am sure it wasn't too steep.  As the night went on the place thinned out, and soon the wife and I were the only two people in the place.  The bartender, Anthony, was a joy to talk to.  We ended up just hanging with him until it was time to go.  I would go back just to have a bartender that good. Hell, the place is called Friends, and I'd be his friend any day. He was full of conversation and laughs.  At the end of the night, he called us a cab and made sure I didn't leave anything behind in my Ketel One haze.  He nearly had to come out to the parking lot to give me a record I left on the bar from a concert we attended earlier in the evening.This place really is a comfortable and clean neighborhood bar that was welcoming to a random couple having a fun night on the town.  It was a great way to end a great night out.Also, I would totally wear a friends T-shirt if they have them.  I love the logo.

"This one time, at Apollos, some gay dudes asked my friend and I if we were real women. I knew I should have waxed my mustache before going out that night! But never mind that snafu- I always feel like a diva here!The girls and I have been to Apollos a handful of times for karaoke and I'm always a drunken mess every time I leave there. Well I certainly can't handle my liquor but the drinks are poured well here. They have cheap cheap drinks and the first  time I was there, I think the Pink Panther martinis did it for me. They were only $4 too!Great place to gather a bunch of friends for karaoke. Yes its a gay bar but the coolest one. I've always met great guys there. They are never interested in me but they are always so nice and willing to sing a duet with me. The karaoke host is always fun, not a mic hog like some places. My only complaint is that my gay friends like to sing lots of show tunes. BORING! There are definitely some great performers here and but most are here to have a good time so don't feel like you need to belt like Whitney Houston to come here. My favorite things about Apollos are:1) free fresh popcorn! best thing to munch on after you've had a lot to drink2) the ladies room never has a line because its mainly gay dudes that frequent this placeI love Apollos!

"I have been a student of the True Buddha School most of my life. The School is global, with the main headquarters in Redmond, Washington. I recently moved to Charlotte and was so pleased there was a temple here. The people here are some of the nicest I've met! The services are all mostly conducted in Chinese and the attendees are also mostly Chinese, so it can be very disconcerting for non-Chinese speakers. Don't be intimidated! Culturally, there are differences, but everyone is good people! :) On a day-to-day basis, the English is limited, but we definitely have quite a few English speakers dotted within. If you have questions or want to learn more, please feel free to call or stop by and try and make an appointment with an English speaker. We are usually there on Sundays. Regular weekly service (usually group cultivation + meditation) is from 11-1. You can feel free to come by and observe, and we can try and answer any questions you have before or afterwards. And you would be more than welcome to stay for lunch.There are also a number of books and brochures available that have been translated to English. Printed words only get you so far. The best thing to do is to track down an English-speaker and ask everything you've ever wanted to ask. There are no stupid questions, only ""teachers"" who may not know the best answer. :)Currently and at least through the end of the year (2014), we have a dharma class being taught in English from 1:30 to 3. It gets into some of the nitty gritty of Buddhism, so if you are a beginner, I'd recommend talking to someone before jumping into class. Either way, anyone and everyone is welcome.TBS is open to everyone, Chinese or not, and of any religious background!Our spiritual leader is Living Buddha Lian Sheng. Our dharma and our practice encompasses all Buddhist schools of Mahayana, Hinayana, and mostly Vajrayana. While other temples and societies may practice differently, we all believe in the same basic precepts of the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path.

"I consider myself a soul food connoisseur and when I tell you this place was the best, it was really the best.  I have tried every soul food joint in Charlotte and around the united states and consider this one to be at the top of my list.  Where should I begin  We took our family of five here after church.  The children all ordered the fried wings and loved them.  My husband ordered the meat loaf, loved it!  I ordered the smoked pork chops, loved it.  Between the five of us we had green beans, sweet potatoes, mac and cheese, turnips, rice and gravy and corn muffins.  They were all extra great with a special asterisk by the mac and cheese and sweet potatoes.  We continued on with the sweet potato pie and the cherry cheesecake.  Excellent, Excellent!  Extra ""woo woo"" that they do accept credit cards.  The price was reasonable because it included everything.  Our bill for five came up to $52.00.  That averages to $10.40 per person that included our wonderful sweet tea and dessert.  I will continue to return here.  Menu varies from day to day so call before you go.  I can't wait to see if they fry fish or serve liver and onions!!

"I can't complain when I arrive early for lunch. My fav sweet potatoes are soooooo good as ifs the cabbage. However, if I arrive after 12:301:00, the sweet potatoes are gone.

"Hickory Grove is the church where I vote and where my daughter plays soccer. My church, http:www.BranchChurch.org is in a rented facility and has no place to do baptisms. HG let us use their facility on a Friday night complete with sound guys... I think that's really cool!

"Central is my home church and has been for 15 years, so of course I love it. Our pastor is an amazing speaker, my favorite part being that he tells he truth and stands up for it even when he knows he will get a lot of hate mail and a lot of offended people who will leave the church to look for somewhere else where the pastor doesn't step on your toes and hold you accountable. I wouldn't call our music style quite contemporary in that when someone says ""contemporary Christian music"" I immediately think of Chris Tomlin, Brandon Heath, etc., and it's more of a gospel sound, if you have heard of The Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir our music is pretty much exactly the same. We do have a lot of energy in not only our worship but also some during the sermon. We have wonderful ministries for people of all ages, in church, out in the community, and around the world with our great missions department. The most common drawback for people is how big the church is. With over 8,000 members (I of course don't know exacts), and plenty who are not yet members, it can be overwhelming for someone used to smaller congregations. However we offer a shuttling service for satellite parking at both Providence and Country Day School if you want to skip out on the crowded parking lot, and the bus drops you off right at the front door of our sanctuary. Also if you feel that you can't get connected because of he huge crowd in services here's where our said ministries on campus comes in. We have many different options with Sunday school classes you can attend, not just by age or ""single"" or ""coues, but also different subjects (which I don't really know off the top of my head). So come check us out, although we are a great place to worship I know it might not be exactly what everyone wants. Well what can I say I LOVE MY CHURCH!!!

"It's a wonderful church! The pastor is straight to the point and is very honest about his own struggles in life.  He uses the pulpit to preach Jesus and steers clear of politics. He doesn't mince words about Biblical topics. The people are friendly and the choir is amazing.

"Spirit filled church; outstanding music.  The easiest (and not anywhere close to the whole story) description would be ""Pentacostal Lite"".  You're not going to see snakes or much in the way of speaking in tongues but if you are interested in a Church where Jesus is the center focus and worship is an active experience then this is the place for you.  Our family took a long time getting to visit here, but after going to many of the placid, dried up services at other places, we found this to be home.  Loran Livingston is Senior Pastor and gifted teacherspeakerminister.  The choir and musicians are world class and passionate performers.

"The real deal!  If you like your Catholicism quiet and personal with a little organ music and perhaps some donuts after mass, then St. Mary's downtown Phoenix is the parish for you.Originally built in 1881, it is the oldest Catholic Church in Phoenix.  Staffed by the Franciscans and located in the heart of Downtown Phoenix.  The masses are traditional, thoughtful and beautiful.  The choir is phenomenal and there is an innate sense of family there-even as a guest.

"If you are looking for a classic Catholic church in Phoenix, this is it. St. Mary's Basilica has a beautiful sounding choir, wonderful priests and a historically Catholic feel with architecture and structure. I think it has something to do with the fact that Pope John Paul II visited this basilica years ago for World Youth Day. I've been going to St. Mary's Basilica for years. Ironically enough, Father Vince, who is a priest at St. Mary's Basilica, used to be the priest at St Isidore's in Danville, California which was the church I went to when I was growing up. During the holidays, I make sure I attend mass at St. Mary's Basilica. There's something about the architecture, music, and Mass that makes this a perfect church for those times. However, it's also a great church for Sunday mass. Around 7 years ago, my sister married her husband at St Mary's Basilica  and I was lucky enough to be the Maid of Honor. The wedding was a full Mass and made it such a special day for my sister, her husband, myself and everyone who witnessed the ceremony. There isn't much more I can say about St. Mary's Basilica in this review, but I will end this by saying that each Mass is a different experience and it's based on the person attending, but be sure to visit this church and attend a Mass so see if it's right for you.

"While visiting in-laws for Christmas, I attended Midnight Mass at St. Mary's Basilica in downtown Phoenix, and it was one of the first times I understood why it is said that Catholics ""celebrate"" the mass.The Basilica is a beautiful piece of Spanish colonial architecture run by Franciscan Friars, crowned with bell towers, palms, and stained glass windows.The Christmas altar was lit with candles and bursting like a heart in love with the reds of dozens of poinsettias.Midnight mass lasted until 2am, but was so rapt with happiness, that few seemed to mind or notice. Instead, the mass kept ascending in circles like the incense. It was like a holy party, with all of creation joining in the celebration of its Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.The mass was sung and prayed much more than spoken. There were traditional carols, Latin chants, and pieces of Handel's Messiah. The choir did wonderfully as the happy voices of those gathered were all taken up and transfigured as if by one power.The celebrant was Father Vincente Mesi whose beautiful, crystalline voice sang out and chanted the prelude to the declaration of Christ's birth as well as the Gospel reading from the pulpit.By 2 am the people began to stream out of the church with the bells tolling from the towers unabashedly with good news, pounding with a rebellious happiness against the tall, dark downtown buildings and skyscrapers of Phoenix. The bells sang the happy triumph, the surprise victory of love and meekness, over the pride and might of the world.Many, though no doubt not all, felt they had encountered the mystery of a happiness and joy that strips and transcends all human understanding. Many, though no doubt not all, walked away with their hearts full of this sacred joy. Those who did were at least for a moment transformed by this eternity--this holy party which is Christmas.

"We are staying downtown and had decided to go to Sunday Mass in St. Mary's Basilica, one of the oldest churches in Phoenix.  From the outside, it's an mission style stucco exterior, while inside, all the alters are adorned with statues of the saints, and the pipe organ in the upper balcony is absolutely wonderful to hear.  Mass was very old school in that it was sung from start to finish.  It lasted 1 hour and 45 minutes.  Considering the Church is downtown, there were a large congregation present and not everyone looked like a tourist.  It's a beautiful old Church worth taking a look at.

"I attended Mas here last Sunday and so happy I did! Sunday before last, I was dragged to Mass at The Franciscan Renewal Center and it was not joy. It was far too Liberal -- it's simply not my preference as a Catholic.Walking towards the Cathedral, you just feel a sense of history -- it's simply beautiful. I adore so many Patron Saints so I love all the decorated alters. Choir is simply amazing! Times keep changing...but I prefer to celebrate Catholic Mass in a more traditional manor. I attend St. Francis Xavier and Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church on a regular basis but will definitely attend Mass here more often.

"If you are in the Phoenix downtown convention area and you are Catholic, you owe it to yourself to visit this Catholic Church. It is a church like no other. Its beauty is breath taking from the outside and when you step into this holy cathedral, you get a sense of belonging and feel the spirit overcome your body. It is a sacred place and an experience like no other.

"What the hell Yelp don't got Swish Awww hell nawww...Hehe that's my ghetto supa star!Ok so Swish is actually the first shabu shabu place in Vegas. I looked when I moved here. This was the only place. I needed something to get my shabu shabu fix taken care of. Shabu Shabu is when you get a hot pot of water or broth and you ""swish your meatveggiesseafood"" to cook it and eat. I have this thing with interactive food. I love to play with food. ""BE THE BOLOGNA SANDWICH!"" So you come into this strip mall not knowing this place is here. I'm sorry but this place was not easy to find. But yo support yo local businesses. The table setup is kinda cool. It's like a square counter with everyone having their own seperate hot pot. It's a very simple menu. Veggies, meat, kobe, or seafood. You get a healthy size....and a hungry size. They need like Hulk size. But then again this explains so many skinny asians. You can get a variety of apps from Edamame, seaweed salads, miso soup. But the good stuff comes in 2 forms Shabu Shabu form....or Sukiyaki form For dessert - have some Mochi ice cream and rub yer full belly. Mmmmm So this place did place in Best of Las Vegas Staff picks 2006. If you get lost it's on Sahara near Buffalo!Now I need to find a Japanese curry house....

Don't be intimidated by the ""make it yourself"" portion. The servers are crazy nice and help you out the whole time. I was ""that guy"" and screwed up my order about 4 times before figuring out what I wanted and the servers were accommodating and gracious the entire evening. How can you beat great food and watching crazy Asian TV They were playing some show that's a mix between MXC and American Gladiators. So intense! I love this place.

"One of my all time favorite places to eat in VEGAS!!  Way off the strip, it's best to come to Swish, when it's not peak eating hours.  The first time I came here, I arrived right about the time they opened.  This turned out to be a good thing.  By the time my friends and I were finishing up with our leisure lunch, the place was filling up quickly and nicely.The layout is waaay cool.  A large U shaped counter sits in the middle of the room.  Sitting out the outer edges, your server will provide you with a gas grill and give you your choice of shabu shabu or sukiyaki.  Or, loosely translated - wet (soupy) or dry meal (grilled)  You get to 'swish' your food yourself.  If you give a stupid enough look, your server might be as sympathetic as mine and help you out with the cooking.  Luckily, I've done this before, so no stupid looks here!  At least, not in regards to getting my cook on.The average plate is slightly price, but it is well worth it.  The owner and staff are awesome and friendly.  I try to hit up Swish, whenever I get the chance.  You should, too!

"There's only one way to describe this place. Perfect. Ok so no decor. And yeah you cook it yourself. I don't care. I love it.There is a happy hour. But grr. I think it ends at 5. So grab a bottle of Sake. Order the Kobe Beef in the Sukiyaki and enjoy life.The tofu. The edamame. Everything. It is pricey. Yes. I wish it wasn't.
",1
"This was the first REAL restaurant I ate at when I first moved here.  Then I ended up here 3 times in 2 weeks! I hear alot about price, but if you want quality, you gots ta pay for it!!!!  That said, the meat is good color, marbling.  The Kobe Chuck is definitely the STAR here, a bit darker in color, but the texture and flavor is hard to describe other than it's yummy for my tummy!  For the not so adventurous, there is the prime rib cuts, a bit smaller but still good.  they could be a bit more generous on the veggies, but then again I'm not here for the veggies...it's all about the BEEF!! The key to good shabu is the secret sauce, ponzu... you have to make your own lil sauce concoction with ponzu base, garlic, green onions, nanami togarashi (japanese pepper sprinkles,ask for it) be generous with it and a bit of chili paste.  add to the broth too....less the ponzu.  I'm not a big fan of the sesame sauce, but tasty too.  try not to overcook the meat, 10 to 12 seconds is all it takes.... can't forget to mention Angie and Marina, the 2 tallest asian girls ever, very nice and friendly....but watch out, 50% beer, sake 9 to 10pm and they just may have a drink with you.... til next time, good eating!

"I went to Swish for the first time last week and it was so amazing that I returned 2 days later and joined yelp to tell everyone about it. They have 2 portion sizes, one is healthy (smaller), and one is hungry. But the great thing is that if you do get the smaller portion you can add on just a little bit more at any time if you're still hungry. The place is pretty small, the counter is in a big U shape and your little hot pot is in front of you on a counter. The staff is really friendly and take good care of you. Happy hour is from 9pm till 10pm and that is 50% off, half of sake makes me happy. I had the Kobe Chuck and it is amazing, sliced so thin it almost falls apart. The chicken is amazing too. I'm just going to go ahead and say everything is amazing. They also have adorable bento boxes for lunch. They are vegetarian friendly which is very nice and the prices aren't that high. The Kobe chuck dinner is around $16. My only gripe with the place is they play some cheesy radio station all day.

"Very good place for shabu shabu.  If you are coming from the strip, make sure your cab driver takes the highway, it is much faster.  I had the Kobe chuck and it was very flavorful, with good veggies on the side too.  This place is a nice retreat from the crowded Strip restaurants if you want to get away for a while, and is the only shabu place near the Strip as far as I know.

"I love this restaurant one of my favorites. Everyone gets their own hot pot! The concept works. Very excited to go there again. I've already recommended it to most of my friends. I wish there was one closer to me.
",1
"Officially obsessed with this place. It's so nice to have incredibly tasty healthy fresh food when dieting (or just in general! ) . The $13.99 Kobe chuck lunch special is hands down one of the best food bargains in this city ! Incredible. I also have to give major props to my favorite server there for always accommodating my obnoxious and bizarre food requests. Today he made me a custom plate of low carb veggies (mushrooms, asparagus, and cabbage) instead of the usual mix! Very cool of them to say the least. Also have to add they have alternate noodle options if you don't like udon - just ask! Prices are awesome and the servers will bend over backwards for you. Highly recommend, especially for lunch !
",1
"This place is now on my list of, ""I don't care if I ate this earlier this week, I'll eat this again tonight!"" foods.  Yes, I know, that's not a very memorable or catchy list, but it gets the point across!  I think I have to get my sukiyaki fix every couple weeks, or else I start to crave it!When ordering your meal you're presented with several options: the type of meatchickenseafood, the portion size and shabu shabu or sukiyaki style.  Once those details are out of the way, food is brought to you almost immediately.  The waitress gets your stove going for you, and you're off!  Your choice of meat is brought out to you, along with an assortment of vegetables that include onions, green onions, asparagus, carrots, mushrooms and cabbage.  You also get some udon noodles and a bowl of rice.  Additional condiments are chili paste, radish and green onion that you can add to your broth.I've had the shabu shabu here before, but it wasn't something that I'll be eating again anytime soon.  The broth seemed quite plain and didn't seem to do much more than boil my veggies and meat.  The sukiyaki however, has won me over.  I love the sweetsoy sauce flavor of the broth itself, as well as the fact that the veggies and meat do take on the flavor of the sauce.  Bonus Tip: Checkout the front table by the entrance that has business cards and newspapers.  One of the newspapers is a Korean newspaper, and on the cover there is a coupon for Swish that gets you 10% off your meal! ;)

"This place finally opened up and it was definitely worth the wait. The restaurant isn't very busy since not a lot of people know that it is open yet. The decor is modern, the music is fun, the place is very clean and they also have 3 big screen TVs. The restaurant is Asian Fusion mixing, Thai, Chinese, and Korean dishes. Having never been to a restaurant like this, the staff  was very friendly and helpful in explaining the different things on the menu. My friend and I decided to try the shabu shabu (hot pot), the grill and we ordered pineapple fried rice as one of our sides. Every thing on the menu is very reasonably priced. For the shabu shabu, you get to pick out 2 sauces to cook your food in, we picked coconut milk and the spicy chinese ones. You also get to pick out the different  tray of meats and vegetables you want to cook in them. Each tray of food is individually priced but very reasonable. We picked chicken, beef, mushrooms, and a separate tray of veggies, every thing was very fresh. We also picked Korean short ribs for the grill. We had a lot of questions for our waitress, she helped us cook all our food and came to check on us several times in case we had any additional questions for her.  For dessert we tried the mango sticky rice, it was very refreshing. I was very impressed at how good the food was and how much food we got for the price we paid. I would definitely recommend this place to every one. It is a hidden treasure.

"I've driven past this place more than a handful of times waiting for it to say ""OPEN""Luckily, it finally is! I'm so glad I've kept my eye on this place because it was exceptional! Although it hasn't had it's ""Grand Opening"" the service was exceptional, they answered ALL my questions. We had shabu, which included Original broth and spicy oriental broth with:- Beef- Scallops- Tofu- Vegetables- Extra enoki mushroomsIf you do come, please ask for their peanut sauce! It is delicious and flavorful and my mouth is watering because of it. I will definitely be back!

"I had the pleasure of dining at Shabu Grill last week with my family. It's now my favorite place for Shabu Shabu. Great ambience, unique Shabu broth, great tasting food, definitely coming back soon.1. Must try the coconut and lemon grass Shabu broth 2. Love that you get to pick out your plate of beef, seafood and wonderful varieties of Asian vegetables; they had Tong Hao, my must have for Shabu3. Pad Thai and Pumpkin Chicken Curry were awesome4. Paula, the server were so patient to explaining to people who have never had Shabu5. Do try the Mango sticky rice, great way to end your lunch

"Finally Shabu in the neighborhood & to my surprise it was really good!! Korean BBQ & Shabu

"So my friend and I got curious with Shabu Grill with all the good Yelp reviews.. And i must say everyone is right! Love this place! Everything is pretty much a la carte. My friend and I decided to do asian style and share our food together. I did the Shabu grill and she did the japanese hot pot.I really love the concept of this place. Pretty much all the meats and veggies are prepared and you can grab as much as you want from the fridge. everything is lined up and organized with all the meats and veggies. BE WARNED it is not all you can eat. they charge you per plate. average cost for a plate was 4.95$ for beef but the way my friend and i eat we racked up alot of plates and not even pay attention to how much we spent.The food is great they have an array of sauces you can choose from. I didn;t really use any of it because i already like the natural flavors of the meat i was grilling and as for my friend she loved her japanese hot pot.For those of youhave like authentic japanese you will be discouraged because the hot pot was not japanese at all it was more Chinese but we till loved it though.I felt this palce was really unique because it was Asian food fusion with all the other countries. The restaurant was a combination of japanese, thailand, korean..They are still in the works in getting the place together, they are adding a bar and tapas coming soon..I really love this place the food is great and the cleanliness of the place is excellent as well.The staff is great they fill your water up constantly and really friendly.I am a new loyal customer of Shabu Grill and will definitely return here.Try now! you will not be disappointed

"I'm a FAN!!!$6.99 for Bento Box lunch ! And it's tasty!  You pick 1 of like 8 difft curries [ I got the pumpkin bc it was difft and was delicious], white or fried rice, salad or egg roll.  It needed more spice for me, but I like it HAWT. BUT they do have like 6 diff sauces on the table and you can heat it up that way.The Thai Salad is awesome and big enough to share. Peanut dressing is to die for and the crunchy tofu is just right. It also has chicken and shrimp on it.I didn't try the Shabu but I'm going back at dinner time one night to do this. Best little neighborhood gem I've found in a while.Decor is pretty sweet too, parking was super easy, and they had Kaskade on.  Hours are 11 am to 10 pm. Couple of TV's inside but no sound on.  Waitress was very attentive as well.

"Tonight was the soft opening. Great selection and fresh! Good choice of broths and reasonable prices.

"Shabu Fondue only opened a few nights ago, and they are already off to a great start! We were so impressed with the variety of the menu and ended up ordering two different broths, both of which were spicy and delicious. We ordered a ton of ingredients, but the pork dumplings and grass-fed beef were by far favorites at our table. We were lucky enough to have chefowner Johnny Chu stop by our table probably three times just to chat and see what we liked and what we didn't. A great experience overall!
",1
"We had been to Tien Wong hotpot in Chandler (T-Spot) about ten times and had high hopes for Shabu Fondue. It delivered, and then some, the portion sizes tripled and the quality was identical as the old location. My only complaint was that it was uncomfortably hot in there, needed to be 5-10degrees cooler to offset all the steaming hot pots. This place remains awesome!
",1
"An amazing date night experience! The food was high quality and fresh! Everything was delicious. We ordered the ying yang pot(choice of 2 broths) with the Ma long(spellling) spicy and the coconut curry. Both were fantastic but the spicy one is pretty spicy. Our proteins were shabu beef, New York beef, pork belly, and shrimp. We also got some veggies and noodles. Chef and owner was a really cool guy and stopped of at our table a few times throughout the night. You can tell how passionate he is about the ingredients he uses. This would be a great place for the whole family imo. You can teach your kids about the foods and they can watch them cook. We are already planning our next trip!
",1
"We went to Shabu Fondu with a group and we had a great experience! The staff was friendly, accomodating, and helpful. The food was great and it was fun to cook it yourself. The menu is rather extensive and it would be easy to eat vegetarian here. They served there water with some cucumber and that was also tasty. The wife and I had the Curry and Shabu Beef, Broccoli, Bok Choy and Rice Noodles. It was a winning combo!

"I discovered shabu when I worked in Sacramento where there are several restaurants serving this style of food, but until now you haven't been able to get it in Phoenix which I why I was thrilled to hear that this location had opened... and close to my house to boot.For those who've never had it, shabu is an asian style of fondue, sometimes referred to as hot pot. Instead of oil, cheese, or chocolate each table has its own warmer to which they bring you a large bowl of soup broth in which you cook your food. You can even order two types of broth that come in a large container that is split down the middle.We ordered two, the base, house broth for the kids and a slightly spicier lemongrass broth for us. We then ordered a mix of items to cook including beef, chicken, tofu, broccoli, dumplings, crab, scallops, and noodles. When they bring the items, they tell you how long each one should cook and its helpful to arrange them by cooking time starting with the longest that take 3 to 4 minutes and working down to those that take only a minute or less.Once you have all of your food, the fun begins. My kids had a blast deciding what to try, cooking their own food, and eating with chopsticks.Service was excellent, our server stopped by several times to see how we were doing and to adjust the heat on our hot plate. The manager (owner) stopped by a few times as well to make sure we were having a good time and we assured him that we definitely were.The atmosphere was fun as well. It's decorated sort of like a club and they were playing a great mix of tunes, including stuff that we used to go out dancing to in the 80s and 90s... definitely a Bright Lights, Big City type of place. The manager even mentioned that they have a DJ in the Thai restaurant next door on Friday and Saturday nights.While we had a great time as a family, this would also be a blast for an adult night out on the town. If you've never had shabu, or you've been missing it in Phoenix, you definitely want to head on out to Shabu Fondue for an enjoyable time!

"Absolutely delicious! Very friendly service as well.Got 2 broths, Thai and Chinese, with 2 meats (shabu beef and pork loin), 2 vegetables (shiitake mushroom and napa cabbage), 1 house special firm tofu, and oval noodles.

"Awesome to have a shabu place in phx. Fresh healthy food, great service,  and lots of different sides and proteins to choose from. As an LA native I was thrilled to find this style of cuisine on my door step.

"Loved this place and will be back again! So nice to have a new, different, choice in the neighborhood.  The staff was really nice and showed us how to order, add items in our hot pot, and made suggestions from the grill.  The grill items are like sushi or tapas in that they are small, economically priced, portions, and you can try a bunch.  We went nuts, had a beer, and still had a very reasonable check.  Our 8-yr old boy was with us too and they were great to him!

"LOVE this place! The first place I can find in AZ has real Asian style BBQ Skewer. It's a small and cozy place. Good for date night and girls night to just enjoy the food since they open late till 12pm or 2am. We only try BBQ last night, and the taste is indeed perfectly delicious! Most of other BBQ place either make them too salty or sweet or sour, etc... Just doesn't taste right. But in here you don't have to worry about it at all.Staff are very polite and friendly. Give out good recommendation. A very nice dine-in experience.Will come back and try their Hot Pot or Bento next time.

"I've been this place for dinner for a couple of times and I pretty like this place. Prices are pretty acceptable and foods are pretty delicious. In this restaurant,  Lamb kebab is absolutely my favorite from the menu and mini hot pot is my second best choice. I also usually order three orders of onigiri instead of steam rice if I am tired of steam rice. I am glad that I found this new opening Eastern Restaurant that pretty fit to my taste.
",1
"Finally a hot pot restaurant that fill me up without emptying my wallet. Great environment for small group of people to try out their hot pot. Was told this is the place for great hot pot and bbq. Was very happy about the experience with this restaurants. The owner couple are very young, energized and friendly. Although the background music is a little loud, but I was focusing on the food too much. Don't go there after 7:00pm to mid-night over weekend unless you want to hang out with young Chinese crowd. They did offer different sauce for the hot pot, but you have to ask for it. My favorite is the the seafood hot pot.
",1
"I decided to come back here to try other dishes and I must say I was NOT disappointed. This time was better than the first time.This time I had the Spicy Beef hot pot, which I absolutely LOVE. I actually prefer this than the Seafood hot pot. It has more flavor and the spice level was on point. We also ordered the Lamb, Chicken, and Beef skewer, let's say with every bite you have a burst of delicious flavor in your mouth. I highly recommend it!

"I am actually a traveler. I wish I could stay here as long as possible. Or maybe they could open another store in Boston. Service is good. I like the girl a lot. And food is very well presented and prepared. Very fresh I can tell. I ordered seafood hotpot and my friend ordered spicy beef hotpot. I would strongly recommend seafood hotpot!!I will visit AZ again in a year maybe 2. I will definitely come by again.

"This place is great. The food is really quite good. It has something for everyone. For the not so adventurous eaters you can go with the yakitori or beef, and for the very adventurous there are lots of options. The hot pots are quite good. We split a spicy beef and got items off the BBQ menu. Our favorite was the cabbage, SO good. Also the beef, yakitori and jalepenos were awesome with a sweet delicious sauce. I definitely recommend trying this place out.
",1
"Cool atmosphere and nice staff. The food is reasonably priced for what you get. My wife is Taiwanese and is quite happy with the quality of the food.The hot pot is above table (not an inside the table hot pot you get in Asia)  Really enjoyed the California rolls. Definitely would recommend this place for anyone looking for hot pot or a cool asian restaurant for date night.

"This brings me back memories of Boiling Point in SoCal, the taste is almost identical! The whole time I was eating I was telling my fiance how much I LOVED it.  The service is kind of slow as they are pretty understaffed but the food overshadows that.  We got the spicy beef pot, seafood pot, and kimchi potSpicy Beef-  Pretty spicy for my taste, doesn't come with enough beef but fiance loved it.Seafood pot- was my favorite comes with a lot of clams, shrimp, crab, and some pork. Kimchi pot- comes with kim chi of course, hot dogs (asian hot pot staple, weird I know), and pork.  I am usually a beef lover but their pork cooks better than their beef does.  The takoyaki is not worth ordering... now this appetizer is normally crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.  This one was just soft... flavors were there but texture fell flat.  We will be back every week!

"I have found my new favorite lounge here in Scottsdale...and I don't have to drive down to Old Town!! Stone Rose is the innovative creation of the Gerber Group.  by infusing Scottsdale's nightlife with cutting-edge design, signature cocktails, and a dash of glamour - all within a unique indooroutdoor setting.A large outdoor bar is surrounded by couches and fire pits and beautifully landscaped.  The indoor portion of the barlounge has wooden floors and ceilings with black leather couches...making for a retro 1950's feel.Stone Rose is absolutely beautiful within the Fairmont Princess grounds.

"I've been to this place probably 30 times and it never ceases to have the tastiest drinks and friendliest bartenders in all of Scottsdale. Meredith, Steven, Fernando and Mike will make you a consistently delicious drink each and every time no matter what your taste buds crave! They're also hilarious and will have you smiling through each tasty libation. Be sure to check out the black raspberry martini and ask for the limelight.

"First night out in Edinburgh and from a guide book we had The Dome was listed as a place for the deserving diners who wanted luxury. The building itself on the outside is nice, not impressive, but once you get into the place and past the hall your eyes just feast on the opulence of the restored interior of the Victorian former bank and the well designed bar area. They certainly added to the interior when the bar and restaurant was designed, someone really knew how to make the most out of this Victorian interior. We ordered our Tom Collins (perfect, great start when they get your cocktails right), and asked to see someone about possible seating in the dinning area. As the place looked busy we thought we would have to wait a while, but this was taken care off very swiftly by the Restaurant Manager 'Alan' and shown to our table by a very helpful waitress who applied the same high standard of service all night long, and we were in no rush. The food is as you would expect for a fine establishment, first class, also the service by the various staff was again first class. Anyone going to Edinburgh for work or play, treat yourself to a wonderful dining experience and go to The Dome, it's a must.
",1
"Can't rate the food because I didn't have any, but what an amazing bar! The Christmas decorations are breathtaking, the staff is very friendly, and for being as beautiful and centrally located as it is, alcohol prices were very reasonable. Especially if you are travelingpassing through, take an hour or so to stop by this bar. You won't regret it!
",1
"Now The Dome is marvelous and situated in a beautiful building. But I must point you in direction of the Garden Cafe, which is the outside cafe area located at the back of The Dome. The same fantastic food but outside in the sun! Entrance is via Rose Street so don't wander inside The Dome and get lost like we did.My Gran and I sat outside here one day and enjoyed a fabulous lunch. We both had Caesar Salad which was delicious, as well as sharing a plate of chips. My Granny just loves chips so its great to get my carb fix. For dessert I had Sticky Toffee Pudding which came with the most refreshing Coconut ice cream. It had homemade shortbread too. It really was to die for and the highlight of the meal. While we were eating it started to rain and all the waiters hurried around us erecting these huge umbrellas. It was fun to watch and it felt like we were in a tent once they had finished. The Garden Cafe is only open in the summer months though, so it is great for that time of year. Otherwise I go back inside to The Dome which never fails to impress with the amazing surroundings and wonderful service.
",1
"Every Christmas, my mum and I get butterflies about going to The Dome. If you've seen the Christmas wreaths wrapped around the pillars, you'll begin to see why, and if you go inside you will understand completely. It's like they have a room spray of all the Christmas smells and keep it constantly puffing out in plooms of fairy dust and laughter. Every year I have to catch my breath when I go into The Dome, because it is quite simply breathtaking. The decoration is beautiful and the whole atmosphere is electric.Even when it's not Christmas, The Dome just has a magical feeling about it. It's like a fairytale. Yeah it's a bit pricey but worth every penny. You can't go to somewhere like The Dome and not expect to pay for it. It's also a hot-spot for celeb-spotting (although the amount of celebrities in Edinburgh is extremely limited).

"The interior ""Dome"" is magical.  I thought maybe it had once been a church, but it has been converted from a bank.  We just had drinks, so I cannot comment on the food.  Their Christmas decorations were breathtaking

"Was at this fabulous restaurant last night with clients. Thursday night in Edinburgh and at 8pm it was packed, when we finally pushed back from the table at 1115 it was still packed. In Portland on a Thursday night at 1115, just about everything is closed. The room itself is fantastic, converted from an old bank, it is incredibly ornate with a huge stained glass dome hanging over the room. Yes I did have the haggis, wrapped in phyllo as an appetizer and it was amazing. The rest of the meal was of equal quality and the service was impeccable. If you find yourself in the Scottish capital make your way to the dome

"Yes, the place to take your friends from abroad to show off some granduer of Edinburgh! I like the time around Christmas when they go all out and install the theme to the max. Decorated pillars outsite Check! Massive tree in the main bar  restaurant Check! Good atmosphere, friendly waiting staff and free nuts or haggisballs! Check, check and check! It is a good place to start of your evening on George street (if a little expensive) You will be well impressed.

"First time in the Dome and will be paying another visit soon, cannot rate highly enough such an amazing place at Xmas. Decorations are superb they have spent a lot of time and effort to get it looking this good, it even smells like Xmas due the amount of cinnamon sticks intertwined within the decorations. Never had time to dine but sampled a few cocktails and they were top notch, bit pricey but worth every penny for the atmosphere alone.
",1
"Beautiful restaurant and very good quality food - possibly the best we had there while on a recent trip. The server did not have a good command of English which doesn't bother me from an ethnic standpoint but makes it difficult to communicate. In fact, Edinburgh seems to be populated by foreign guest workers and oddly, they are almost all in service positions. Must be plenty of jobs there and I'm guessing low unemployment rate Anyway, I digress and again want to state how opulent this place is. And the food presentation matches the surroundings!
",1
"WHOO HOO !!!  Just heard The Dome is putting up its Xmas decs next weekend. Must be the best place in town for a Xmas night out. Always make a point of popping in to see it
",1
"You'd be forgiven for walking straight past the entrance to this place, tucked down a flight of steps just off George Street, but in my opinion that's half of it's charm. It's popular and highly-regarded without needing to shout about it; people know about it because of the quality, not because it's in your face.It's easy to see why. When you step inside it's like being on some sort of Japanese garden terrace, with the green leafy plants and water feature. Rick's pay great attention to detail: every table has a copy of that morning's newspaper neatly folded on it, next to the fresh flowers, and the service is efficient without being annoying and intrusive.Although it's never going to make the Top 10 list of cheapest places in Edinburgh, you do get what you pay for. That said, at the moment all of the Montpeliers venues have their ""Better By Half"" promos on: glasses of house wine, selected cocktails, selected beers and even champagne by the glass are all half price at the moment. I've been making the most of these offers every time I'm out for fear that they might finish soon, but despite my panic-drinking it seems they're here to stay for a whie yet. Happy Days.I've only ever drunk here, but one of these days I will be going for food... the plates I've seen being carried to other tables do look and smell gorgeous. There are always enough people in here to give the place a nice buzz, but never enough to make it the kind of busy where service starts to slump and the temperature goes through the roof.
",1
"In the last 6 months Ricks has definitely had a good shake up, and after my fantastic experience last week I think things can only get better. The bar team are innovative and original and during a busy Friday night shift never failed to impress me as I worked my way through the new cocktail list! And the bar snacks were unique and delicious! The DJ provides a funky relaxed atmosphere and gradually builds up the beats to get you in that weekend mood! I will be back again and again and will be taking all my friends too! I recommend a passionfruit frozen margarita or 'busy with the fizzy' strawberry soda stream cocktail! Just fab!

"This bar is a life saver after all day of walking at the Sands convention center. This is a nice place to sit and enjoy a cigar, have few drinks. Drinks are moderately priced, service is excellent if any downside I can think of that will be to find a seat right after the closing of a convention when you can get run over by stampede of tired and thirty convention attendees. I love this bar and of course will visit again.

"Amazing new restaurant in the Scottsdale Quarter.  This place has it all, great food, great ambiance, great selection of champagnes and wines. I went there New Years Eve on their second night open and had a fantastic night.  The room was breathtaking and the people there were great, not to mention the service was right on!  Haven't been to any other club in town that has the feeling Narcisse has!  Do not miss out.

"Narcisse is a beautiful place! I've been waiting so long for a champange bar in the valley! I consider myself a champagne connoisseur, so I had to go try it out! I was there on opening night as well as there new lady's night on Thursdays! I'm very impressed with the staff and service, as well as the by the glass list. I will definitly be back and will be bringing more friends! I highly recommend it!

"Dear Narcisse Management,Everything is delicious and amazing. However, you have a misspelling displayed prominently. I will tell you where when you treat me and select friends to a bottle of Champagne. Warmly and amusedly, Dally Gold

"I was here last night with a group of about 150 people for a Scottsdale League for the Arts event.  Everything was great and this place was rocking!Great drinks and selection of bubbly.  Cool decor, good music, pretty people and friendly service.

"Oh the joys of Scottsdale; see a great movie in an awesome theater - then stop next door for glass of champagne and fresh strawberries and chocolates on a lovely outdoor balcony.  We ordered glass of the champagne that James Bond always ordered in Bond movies - what a treat...

"Newly opened in the chic and trendy Scottsdale Quarter, Narcisse is an opulent champagne lounge that feels like it's straight out of Vegas. So much so, that they've got velvet ropes at the entrance. Fortunately, the doormen waved us right through so we didn't have to endure a wait.Once inside, we found ourselves in a gorgeous space filled with gorgeous people. Everyone was dressed to the nines and the crowd was mostly in their late 20's to late 30's, with a dash of cougars and manthers. The DJ on Saturday night was spinning fun hip hop and dance beats, but my girl friend and I seemed to be the only ones who let loose on the dance floor. Sure, sipping champagne is sophisticated but stop being so stiff, people!Definitely a chic spot to lounge with friends, mingle with strangers and dance the night away. There's a great outdoor seating area as well, with lots of heat lamps set up, so we also enjoyed hanging out there and meeting some really friendly locals. They serve up a huge selection of champagne as well as beer and spirits, but you really can't come here without popping a bottle. VEUVE!

"One of my new favorite lounges to go to with the girls.   1. I am a HUGE champagne fan 2. You can smoke on the patio 3. the drinks are great and 4. I LOVED the decor and atmosphere.  My friend and I were at Salt next door for a friends birthday party on a Friday night and decided to sneak next door for a drink to check it out.  The staff as a whole were awesome, everyone was very polite and sweet.  It has that chic feel with all the servers wearing cute corsets and dresses.  The DJ was great as well, fun music that kept the energy level up without making it too clubby and easy to still cary a conversation. Definitely a great new place to sit back and lounge in a place with a fun atmosphere and good service. Yay!
",1
"This is my new favorite place in Scottsdale!  First of all, I love champagne so any bar that is a champagne lounge, gets my vote!  The service was good, the champagne selection was vast and the atmosphere was totally amazing - the decor was eclectic and so unique!
",1
"Love, love, love Champagne Brunch at Narcisse!The decor, service, and food is phenomenal and a few glasses of bubbles can never hurt a Sunday morning. I've enjoyed the pancakes, scones, eggs benedict, and my favorite breakfast sammy - the dom! Everything is elegantly plated and tastes really fresh.The nightlife is upscale, but a little Scottsdale-homogenous - everyone seems to look the same. If that's the scene you crave, then Narcisse is the place to be!Hm.  Now I want breakfast food and champagne...
",1
"Finally made it to Narcisse on Friday night and found the place quite fabulous. With it's glam decor, comfy seating, and pretty views I was a happy camper. I got served my drinks very fast each time I ordered,  the music was pretty loud but still enjoyable, and the crown was attractive, friendly in the late-20's to early 40's age range, which is just right for me.  It's nice enough to wear heels and a little dress, or even jeans and a cute sweater. It was not overly crowded, nor did we have to wait in line to enter so nice job Narcisse! I shall be back for Sunday Brunch to take advantage of your $10.00 endless bubbly's!!

"Tonight was the grand opening and.....they nailed it.  SERVICE: A+ DECORE: A+DRINK STRENGTH : A+TIME TO GET IN: C (with being on the list w a table) but with all the other A's...it was worth it.They have a girlsguys bathroom with a bar in it that is one of the coolest things I have ever seen and music that is ""bumpin"".  We even ordered some food to munch on and it was DELICIOUS. we got the tuna tartar a chicken salad and some pork stick things that were great portions and very tasty.  Plus the service never faltered and was super impassive for being PACKED and opening night.All in all...I was IMPRESSED and for SURE going back.

"I REALLY wish we hadn't left The Mint last night.  The only thing I did not love was the mint we dropped on drinks, but hey its Scottsdale. Oh, and the boobs in my face.Our bartender A.J.  took great care in muddling my Jefferson (5 stars) and Sharman's Mint (how can you go wrong with a drink named after the establishment) while entertaining us with an infused vodka taste test. My new favorite drink was discovered last night--ginger vodka press: run, do not walk to your nearest liquor dealer.The tapas were ultra cheap and tasty, we took down the tuna tartare and  fried wontons and there are several others I would go back for.  These two items were the perfect base for our evening ahead.  I want to return for the Bubbles- The Gold Digger. Eye candy of all ages, dress to the nines for this joint!
",1
"Finally a nice upscale establishment with a Vegas feel in Scottsdale. Great decor, professional and attractive staff, all around a great environment. I am surprised at some of the comments on here that are negative. Clearly those people have never been to many clubsbars. The door hosts are some of the best in the state. Anyone that has ever been to a hot night club knows if it is busy and you want to get in quick be extra nice to the door staff not act like a moron with an attitude. If you don't want to wait in line get there early. It's also nice to see a place with a dress code so that guys actually have to look some what respectable an not like a bum wearing shorts an flip flops. Use your head fellas your going out on the town not to a pool party, have some pride in the way you look. The Mint is top notch, thank you for a great time every time. I am a fan for sure.
",1
"Our Group has enjoyed being a little spoiled at this venue. The staff is always willing to accommodate our large group (of possibly louder than normal Queens. I mean temperamental. Wait, I mean, well-mannered gentlemen).Our bartenders have taken care of the random requests we somehow always seem to come up with after a few drinks. And the taller gentleman with the buzz cut and Amazing Arms can take my money any day. He is HOT!!!If it is a late night drop in just before we call it a night on a Saturday of Thursday the back rooms are a blast to shoot the Sh!t in. Or an early visit to start off the Sunday Funday up in front in one or two of the booths they have available. The Mint will offer a fun experience and I recommend making time to visit the powder room!!!
",1
"I spend a few nights a week in Old Town, and will always end up at The Mint.  Their door staff, bouncers, and VIP hosthostess are all very nice and have spoiled me to no end, lol!  I like the more upscale vibe here, and was reminded of how well this club sets itself apart from others when I visited another venue just around the corner a week ago.  The D-bag factor was HIGH at the other club, not so much here.  It seems they actually pay attention to who they are letting through the doors at The Mint, which is a welcome reprieve from a lot of clubs in Old Town.  I saw one reviewer's posting about all the seriousness of The Mint's clientele...and while I've witnessed this a couple of times before, I attribute it to what I've experienced in other clubs:  I just get worn down some nights by all the 20-somethings getting flat wasted, making a scene, or hitting on me (I'm 42) and after a solid evening of that I just might be a tad antisocial myself, LOL!  But you generally don't find that at The Mint.  It's a safe place to hear great beats, hang out with good friends, and make a few new friends as well!They have a very good menu too, and I suggest going before club hours to sample it (although their kitchen is open during club hours as well!).  The Mint will ALWAYS be my go-to spot, and I always suggest it to visitors.

"Great for dinner before the music starts!

"Very cool place.

"I Love this place. Its a very classy place to hang out and lounge during the day time and when you wanna dress up to the 9s its a fun night club at night. I really enjoy the management and find the staff to be very helpful and friendly.

"I love this bar, super upscale and great service when you get table service.  We felt like kings and the place got packed pretty late.  It wasn't busy early but there are so many bars in the area to start at but I highly recommend ending up here.  Isaac took great care of us and went out of his way to make us feel like VIP.  The place is pretty large and has a great outdoor patio as well.  You definitely feel classy when you are in this place.

"So I came on a Saturday night and this place was - amazing! I have been to almost all of the clubs in old town and I have to say this is by far one of the best.I always go mainly to dance and this place was packed and everyone who was on the dance floor danced! Sometimes people are mingling on the dance floor, talking, or only slightly putting effort (in other words, taking up prime space) but people here actually danced! It seems silly, but this is amazing. It encourages other people to do the same and gives a highly energetic vibe to this place. Very attractive. Like people just don't give a f*** and want to have a good time. That's exactly how I like it.The atmosphere was not only created by the enthusiastic crowd but the incredible lighting as well. Ethereal is the best word for it - not too dark, not too bright for the dance floor, and then outside of the dance floor, just bright enough and yet still somehow maintained very low-lighting. I'm not sure how they achieve this balance, but I'm pretty sure it's magic. The decor, appearance, and condition of this place is absolutely gorgeous. The way it was designed is stunning, like a Victoria Secret's model - glamorous, sexy, laced with elegance, and bejeweled with luxury. I also love the layout of this place. Once you enter, you hit the dance floor, which is circular like Maya's, those are the best (between the people and setting, it was the most comfortable dance floor I have ever danced on - people who just wanted to have fun, danced, were very attractive, and chill). You can then go around the dance floor to the bars to get a drink or continue all the way to the back to get a break from dancing. Back there is an extremely nice lounge area where you can lay back, relax, and have a drink and chat. I can't express how much I love this large lounge area in the back, I adore it, I adore it, I adore it. It has so much space, room, and (comfortable!) seating with intimate couches and spinning chairs and it's like a glamorous, long, break room or like another club all together. Yes I love dancing, but hell I need a break for water and a chat too! The bathrooms are back there as well. For those that need it, there's also a long and large outdoor patio with seating.By the dance floors there are actually platforms which you can stand on and dance on, sometimes my friends and I dance on them. They're really convenient when the actual dance floor gets too crowded and you can just hop on one of those. But I do believe they're actually for the go-go dancers that come on Wednesday night. Oops, owell haha. Alright, so I actually did not order a drink here or use the bathroom which are kind of my requirements for giving an honest to goodness complete review, so I'll be back to update on drink prices and quality and whatnot. Honestly I just danced the night away this visit, and loved every second of it. WILL BE BACK. Love you Mint. Oh yeah, and the cover charge for men is $10, while women pay nada. Woo. Love it. The lines were rather short, I think I waited 10 minutes tops. And the people at the front were very friendly and nice, no attitude whatsoever.Possibly because of the cover charge, there were more women than men - whoa rare I know, and there was a variety of ethnicities, so all in all, great mix. In addition to that, it was the first time where I had seen more than 3 attractive guys at a club, haha. Lots of attractive people here, men and women. I don't know what it is but I guess a good looking and feeling club attracts good looking and feeling people. How else could you explain it. First and only club I've seen so many good looking people!I'm coming back here asap. Next weekend. Doing this. Every weekend. If possible. Sorry Maya, Smashboxx, and INTL, but I found a better lover. We can keep it an open relationship if you'd like. I don't mind.

"Very cool. Almost as good as Atl clubs.

"Went to 2 strip clubs last night the 1st was across the street from Arizona mills, it was garbage, women were tweekers music was old as hell. Felt like I was tony Montana the 80s. 2nd club  was this place and they didn't not disappoint. Women were all shades and shapes from thick and slim and a variety of bad chicks. I'm big on music and dj was on fire all the latest music. Mostly hip hop which I love cause let face it who wants to watch strippers dance to Taylor swift or sum bs. Drinks where kinda pricey, I would def pregame b4 going. But tha girls where on point. Shoutout to blue. She had me on cock diesel all night. Will definitely be back when the homies wanna step out again. Comparable to Starz (la) kod(mia) onyx (atl) Dg's(d town) da rhino is where its at

"Champagne is my drink of choice, morning, noon and night. Having Perle so close to my job could present a real problem for me.  With cocktails running around $8.00  and with the staff being so damn charming.  I could easily see myself there at least 3 nights a week, *cha-ching. Downtown champagne is hard to come by. I can count on one hand the number of bars Downtown that even serve it.  Perle is for sure a dream come true for some one like myself. The service here was top notch the waiter, DJ and chef both chatted me up and the bar tender even offered me suggestions on things I might enjoy. I like the lay out of the lounge and I think that a lot of thought want into planning the interior design.  The marble bar also really appeals to me, I have never seen anything like it before. The DJ Leah upon noticing that I was using my e-cig at the bar came down and was very sweet to chat with me and was encouraging since I have been trying to quit smoking.I had the mango ceviche that was so good I had to order another tapas so I had the California too. The mango ceviche was shrimp and salmon with mango, and red onions and cilantro and served with lime wedges. The baby face chef was a little chubster and super sweet to come and inquiry about the dish. All and all I had two tapas and three cocktails, a cham cham, a mimosa and a red rose bud.  My favorite was the cham cham. I will certainly be back to get down with the get down and get my champagne on.
",1
"When I walk in the door, Perle' has my Bellini  ready. All the bartenders go out of their way to chat ya up and educate you about the various menu offerings. I have never met a more caring bar staff.  Bonus Perle's happy hours is from 5:00-8:00 pm!!! 2 dollars off champagne cocktails and $1 tapas.Even if the last time you had champagne was at your brother's wedding or New Years Eve, go in and try a champagne cocktail , you might find out your really do like it!

"So I went here for a co workers birthday party a few nights ago. I must say it's a very nice place. They have leather chairs and sofas all over the place. The lighting is very appropriate for what vibe they are trying to give off here. Drinks are a little expensive. But almost every person including myself was dressed up. Woman had dresses on and man wore suit jackets or dress shirts with ties. The door man wears a tux. The deserts are amazing that's all we had on there menu so I can't tell you much about there other food. The service was fantastic we had our own waiter who only was serving the birthday party. If you want to celebrate a promotion that you got from work or are going out on a date with someone you've been with for awhile I would definitely recommend this place. A lot of couples go here from what I saw so maybe not for someone who is single and I went on a Saturday but the place does get packed so you'll have fun regardless of who your with. They have a jacket check which is nice. Overall I will be going back o this place 5 stars in my book.
",1
"I have been to Perle a few time and this is exactly what Pittsburgh had been missing. It's beautiful inside, the drinks are great and there is a good crowd. I like the fact that they enforce a dress code and keep the place upscale. They have a big variety of champagne to keep the ladies happy. I can't  wait to go back.
",1
"This place is great! I got screwed over on Amazon for a Wii and called around to local pawn shops to see what they had. Most shops were selling Wiis for $50+, but here, Kat gave me a great deal on a bundle AND I got two games for under $10. They were kind, courteous and even hooked the system up for me in store so I could ensure that it works. Their electronics come with a 30 day warranty so if there are any problems, you can take it back.I plan to go back and scope out their laptops when mine finally takes a dirt nap (which isn't far off).Go see Kat and the team at Super Pawn on Central!!

"EZ Pawn is a very trustworthy establishment.  I found a piece of art for sale on-line and EZ Pawn staff assisted me through the entire process.  Their staff returned my calls and emails on-time, completed the transaction on the phone, and assisted me getting the art piece delivered safely to my home in California.  I am a very happy customer and I look forward to working with EZ Pawn again!

"Not a huge selection, but they have some really tremendous vintage pieces. I got my 1956 Rosewood and black leather Herman Miller Eames Lounge & Ottoman in very good condition here--for $4k.  That is remarkable.

"I traded in a set of drums here and was able to get a great deal on a guitar. The employee who helped me was very knowledgeable and honest.  He genuinely cared for the purchase I wanted to make.  He gave me a great deal, and showed me keys components in the item I bought. I would highly recommend doing business with this company. It's a small looking place on the outside, but  when you get inside, they have a good selection or multiple things. Very honest business!
",1
"I stopped here thinking it was Mo money pawn (which I was not impressed with once I found). Really nice collection of things. Musical instruments, tools, guns. They had these two crazy looking knives from Brazil with intricate claywork and real monkey skulls on the hilt. The guy at the counter was very friendly and seemed genuine. The place had a nice vibe. We were looking for ammo, but like every other store in the city right now they were out. I will definitely be back.
",1
"This place is GREAT! Got rid of some jewelry I never wear and they got me the beat price for it. Plus they had a variety of items for sale. The staff was friendly and you can tell that the manager, Johnny, definitely takes pride in his staff and store. Wonderful experience!
",1
"It was my very first time pawning anything in my entire life. I entered EZ Pawn and was helped by a team of very nice gentlemen. My item was appraised and I was given a good amount. My transaction was completed quickly and easily. Everyone at EZ Pawn was extremely helpful and provided me with superior customer service. I would recommend EZ Pawn to anyone, even those who are first timers like myself. Five stars, who knew pawn shops were so nice :)

"We have been here a few times. Liberty is awesome! They always treat you very kindly and do all they can to help people. I won't go anywhere else. Liberty, thanks for being there!
",1
"Thank you Liberty Pawn! I was recently in a bind and needed some cash. The only thing I had of value was an Apple product - and I needed back the following week. I tried 2 places before finding Liberty. I went to a small private shop that held you to the 3 month term, not letting you pay in full early. Forget that. Then there is the famous Super Pawn...I hate them. Not only are they the most awkward people ever, they do not give you fair value for your item. Thankfully, I found Liberty. The staff was genuine, super friendly and honest. They take pride in their business and are very fair with their lending practices. If I'm ever in a bind again, I will definitely come back.

"One of two places to check out whenever I'm in Pittsburgh. For such a small space, Paul's is incredibly dense. They have this unique carding procedure where they keep all the new CDs behind the counter and you bring the card up to the counter to get it. They usually have an amazing used CD selection as well. Plus, they have MOJO and UNCUT magzines flown in from the UK and you can usually get them about a month before Borders does! On most days Paul himself will be there. They are also very plugged into the local scene, as far as what they carry. I rarely leave here without a few amazing finds!
",1
"One of the first things I did when I had a little free time after moving to PIttsburgh was to locate a good CD store.  Paul's definitely fits the bill.  A small but extremely orderly (re: alphabetized!) shop.  I knew what I was looking for, otherwise I could have spent an hour browsing.  Genre sections are clearly labeled and easy to find.  Right when you walk in, you'll find a rack of the newest releases on your right hand side.  After I had acquired my bounty of Wolf Parade and Stephen Malkmus discs, it was time for the final test... having a chat with the staff.  The experience was good - they are friendly and very knowledgeable, and I can look forward to asking them for recommendations.
",1
"It's so small, so compact, and full of everything you could desire really.  Great selection.  Knowledgable staff.  It's truly one of the best things bloomfield and pittsburgh has to offer
",1
"Paul's is my favorite record shop in town! As others have noted--it's not a big place, but it is chock full of (well-organized!) stuff! They have a wide variety of music and the staff is very knowledgeable and friendly.  They know about *music,* not just one variety and they've never been condescending or rude. If they don't have something you're looking for in stock, they'll gladly order it for you, and they were very helpful when I was trying to find out whether an old jazz record had been reissued on CD. If I can't buy my CDs straight from the band, Paul's is where I go.
",1
"update: Paul's is turning into Sound Cat.While I've only been here a couple of years, I find that Paul's consistently has the best selection of new CDs if you have vaguely discriminating music tastes (non-mainstream).  Very wide array of indie music.  Not just your standard indie poprock, but also avant-garde, ambient, etc.  My purchases are ~70% planned, plus a bunch that I spotted while browsing.  Sometimes I'll even see an album here that I wasn't previously aware of and check it out online, then go back and buy it.  Every time I've been here, my reaction is ""Ooooh I can't believe they actually have this"" at 10+ albums; then I have to consider my budget and only buy 2 or 3 at a time.Will definitely continue to go when it's Sound Cat Records.  Strongly recommend.

"One of the great independent record stores, Karl Hendricks runs his business just like he plays: with passion and creativity.

"I have been buying records from this building for the last 20 years.  I was so happy when I heard that Karl Hendricks was taking over the space.  I feel like the selection has gotten even more fine tuned.  They have a wonderful selection of obscure vinyl.  And every one in the store is always so helpful.  Every time I go there I see one of my friends!!!  I love this place.

"We found tons of great vinyl records here. Excellent prices. The dollar bins held all of the treasures.

"A treasure trove, a goldmine, frankly the biggest motherload of quality classic vinyl LPs I've *ever* seen!  Imagine 13,000+ sqare feet of jazz, blues, soul, funk, r'n'b, rock, folk, documentaries, comedy, instructionals, soundtracks, etc.

"You can't find that rare bluessouljazz record on ebay or anywhere else. Jerry prolly has it!!  And the kicker is that the average price for records here is $3-$4!!  Yep, you heard right!!

"Seriously if you're a vinyl junkie, don't go here unless you have all day to browse and listen ... I allocated 2 hours and it felt like 15 minutes!!!  I know folks who make special ""record buying"" trips to 'da 'Burgh from Canada, just to go to Jerry's.  Yes, its that good!!
",1
"I have been to Jerry's about 4 times since moving to Squirrel Hill.  On my first visit I came looking for CD's and left with 5 LP's and a turntable!  There is something for everyone here, and lots of hidden treasures.  A truly localuniqueincredible record shopping experience, don't miss it.
",1
"One of the premier record stores in the entire country! Totally amazing. Not overpriced, has a friendly staff who are there because they're into music. Jerry himself is still there most of the time, even though I heard he was trying to retire. Stores like this are the heart and soul of a city's music scene, and I think that Pittsburgh never died as a record town partly because of this very place! Any visit to Pittsburgh requires a visit to Jerry's and then to Paul's CDs.
",1
"Wow, this is almost overwhelming.  I have never experienced an LP store like this one, as others have said it is an unimaginable amount of records.My one critique of others reviews is that: no, he does not have everything.  These are all used or at least collectible unsealed LPs and you will not find anything current here.  No matter, there are troves of other interesting things and you can get 5 of them for what you would normally pay for new vinyl.
",1
"Something for everyone if your into vinyl that is (don't get kinky I am talking records). You can spend hours in this place digging up hidden treasures. I am finding records of bands from the 70's and 80's like Zebra and Twisted Sister who I would see back on LI at the clubs as a teenager (back in the day) when you would get pulled over for drinking and driving and the police would just say walk home and leave your car instead of throwing you in the slammer and then you would pretend to walk home but when the police left you would double back and get in your car again with all your friends and party some more! (ahhh memories).  Huuhhh huum oh yeah ...Jerry's is rockin for records!
",1
"Wow! Too bad I don't have a turntable! 'Cos this place specializes in vinyl. They have records, records, and more records.  Me, I have a huge CD collection.  I don't believe in MP3 players (because if you only have songs downloaded, you don't really have a music collectiom, do you).  There are some purists who believe that the best sound is on vinyl and my father is one of them.  To back up a moment, my husband Rick was out of town for the day on one of his railfan jaunts.  So my brother Paul and I decided to get together, hang out, and maybe get a little Christmas shopping out of the way.  Dad likes music as much as we do,  He even likes more current bands like Arcade Fire and Snow Patrol.  We decided that some used LPs would make a big splash with the old man.  On an earlier family visit, I pilfered his record and CD collection while Paul created a diversion.We decided upon getting him ""Damn the Torpedos"" from Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers and a rare LP by The Busboys.  Man, I have got to get me a turntable!  This place is awesome and I could spend hours in here.  Now isn't shopping and browsing at a place like this way more fun than Amazon or E-Bay
",1
"Jerry's sells non-recent music on vinyl, either used or collectible.I've known DJs from NYC who took bookings to Pittsburgh simply for the excuse to go to here.  You can spend hours in this store.They have more records than any other record store I've had the luck to see.   More of their records are things you'd actually want to buy.  Their prices are cheap.  Their staff is friendly.For what they do, I've never seen better.
",1
"It's nearly impossible to beat the size & selection here no matter what city you're in. Pretty much any LP here is $3-$4. It's really easy to spend an entire afternoon digging through all the records that Jerry's has.If you've never been there- hit up the ""NewGood Stuff"" first near the front. This is the dumping ground for incoming records. Most of the good ones get snatched before being filed away.  Another fun thing to do is think of any single that may have been on the jukebox while you were a kidteen. Jerry's has it on 45. (The organization back there is amazing!)Don't forget to bring cash! No credit cards.
",1
"There isn't much to say that hasn't been said, Jerry's is where it's at!
",1
"Wow, these idiots who gave 1 star rating must be dork hipsters who know nothing about record collecting.  I've been a customer at Jerry's since he was in Oakland.  Great guy, great store.  It is one of a kind and known across the world.  You could spend a week going through everything.
",1
"Friendlier than B-Side, less hip (in a good way) than Exclusive, Madcity is where the serious local music-makers (and -lovers) shop. The vinyl selection is AMAZING and the clerks are smart without being smart-ass. What you'll find: midwest artists' releases, newused vinyl, newused CDs, magazines, rarecollectible stuff, and a clerk or two with his finger literally on the pulse of the local rock scene. What you won't find: a clerk that will be willing to special order you the latest Steven Seagal country CD. (Come on, guys, I heard it was really good!)
",1
"Wow, I can't believe I haven't reviewed MadCity yet. I've been to most of the music stores in town, and they're all pretty good (especially considering that in my neck of the woods now, my selection is limited), but I can confidently say that Madcity is the best. Madcity has a very good selection of vinyl albums, including 45s (which I almost never see anymore even in specialty music stores). There's also an extremely good collection of 60s CDs; most good recordCD shops have plenty of the familiar hit-makers like the Beatles, the Rollings Stones, the Byrds, various Motown artists, etc. How many of them carry music by obscure 60s bands such as Love, or The Gurus Also, their selection of progressive rock (i.e. Yes, Emerson Lake & Palmer) is very good as well. Contemporary stuff is in abundance here as well. If  you live in the Madison area you absolutely must come here, and even if you are just visiting the area... you still pretty much need to make a stop here if you are a music enthusiast.

"A great independent music store.  Really good selection (plenty of obscure stuff).  Lots of vinyl.
",1
"This place has the best selection of music in the downtown radius.  Scratch that, the best selection in Madison period.  I don't mean the have the most music, just the best of the best.  And their 50 cent-$1 vinyl selection is pretty fun to browse through.  The owner seems like a pretty cool guy as well which is nice because he's honest and not always trying to sell me up on something unlike the creep at Strictly Discs.  They have a convenient drop box for 4 Star Video too which is handy now that I live on Willy St.  Hey kids, stop all the downloading!  Support your local record shop.

"While in Madison for a day, I needed to find two specific records....The Association and Sniff'n the Tears.  I went to B-side but they didn't have used vinyl. So I checked out Madcity. As soon as I walked in the door I was greeted with a smile from the guy behind the counter(I soon found out he is the owner).  I was left alone the whole time(which I prefer at record stores).  I was very satisfied with their selection of used vinyl. Madcity is obviously aware that they are catering toward townies and students so they keep their prices appropriate. While I didn't find the two records I was looking for, I did walk away with three gems...Purple Rain by Prince for $3Simon and Garfunkels greatest hits for $3Kick by INXS for $2This is a sweet store with a sweet owner.  No pretention, no games. Just the way I like it.  I even joined the Madcity facebook page...and I don't even live in Madison.
",1
"I've checked out most record stores and this one is at the top of my list. I hate feeling pressured and judged when I shop for music and I've NEVER felt that way here like I do by the pretentious owner at Strictly Discs. The owner of Madcity is pretty chill and friendly, so I never feel intimidated. The selection of vinyl is pretty spectacular too, and at great prices. My favorite thing is their marketing (videos and such)...it's so cheesy and fun that I can tell what kind of environment they create for their customers, and it's very inviting.
",1
"I've been a customer of this store for years.  The best thing I love about this store is you can listen to the used CD's and LP's.  I've found things I would never have bought, but after listening to samples of the CD or LP, picked it up.  It also has worked in reverse, where I've listened to a CD or LP and decided not to buy it.  They also buy used CD's and LP's.
",1
"I was able to find some old, good music in their $1 (50 cents if you buy ten+) sale section. They had the elusive Tribe Called Quest vinyls so I had to pick that up. I didn't know what to expect as I walked in but the guy behind the counter left us alone to browse. He was playing 50's rock and roll, which annoys no one! I even found a vinyl of Juan Gabriel! Maybe the only one in the store but it's mine now. I wouldn't hesitate to be back.. their sale section was filled with so many hidden gems (The Mamas and the Papas, Santo and Johnny, The Supremes to name a few).
",1
"I thought this place was the best...until i moved to San Francisco & visited the jeweled paradise of Amoeba Records. Still, by suburban standards, it rocks! Zia stores have maybe a quarter of the selection of Amoeba (plus, twice as much of a country selection)....but you only need a few handfuls of quarters for purchases here. Those low-down dirty desert prices are everyone's style!

"Zia Record Exchange is an ideal place to locate those hard-to-find CDs you have had no luck finding in those other chain stores and don't want to pay way too much for online. They feature a prominent selection of indie artists from labels such as SubPop and Kill Rock Stars nestled right next to the latest Britney Christina release. You should have no problem finding a few treasures among the aisles and aisles of CDs, used and new. If DVDs are your thing, they offer a fair selection of the typical Hollywood movies. If concert and music DVDs are more up your alley, then this is the place to shop as they have a massive selection of music videos. Vinyl record versions of albums are also available for you DJs out there.It's not called Zia Record EXCHANGE for nothing. You can trade in your used CDs and DVDs when you get tired of them for store credit or for cash. Unless the discs are in pristine condition though, you'll probably be taking them back home with you. Check out their website if you get a chance. You can download a .PDF version of the in-store newsletter for your perusal, or listen to Podcasts featuring music by new and upcoming artists. You'll be sure to discover something new or find that elusive album you've been searching high and low for when you visit Zia Record Exchange.

"I was SOOOO happy when Zia Record Exchange moved so close to my home. This old granny even got herself a Zia's Frequent Buyer card [which someday I'll actually figure out what I'm accumulating!]For those newbies to the Valley who don't know what the heck I'm talking about, ZIa's is one of the Valley's institutions of new, used and just plain weird music, movies and games. These days I see that they're also offering other cool and zany stuff.Every time I go out shopping, hubby says, ""You don't need any more CD's do you"" to which I reply, ""Honey, I ALWAYS need new music.""The selection is really fabulous, the prices are low enough not to bust my budget and the vibe is just -- well, how fabulous can the vibe be at 19th Ave. and Indian School Yet Zia's manages to keep the hip factor alive.And if I ever get tired of my music, not that that's ever gonna happen, they'll buy it back. Such a deal!!!
",1
"I've been going to this Zia for 15 years. Yes, I know. It used to be on 7th and Indian School.  Growing up in a lower middle class family, Mom's suggestion to us if we wanted to get new music was to trade in old. And we did. I remember doing the math. If I traded in 4 CD's, I could afford to get 3 used CD's. Not a bad return. Since they moved, they got to expand a touch. They now have a METAL section, which is brutal. No more thumbing through Brittney Spears or Kenny Chesney when I'm looking for some heavy shit. Customer service is always top notch. The customer rewards card is cool. You accumulate points just for purchasing. A nice place to get CD's, DVD's, and even VHS.
",1
"Zia's is pretty much the equivalent of Newbury Comics, the record store I frequented most back home in Boston.  Now that I've moved out here, it was nice to find something so similar.  re: Chris R.- True, a lot of people are done with CDs due to the changes in the music industry over the years.  But for a lot of people, you can't replace the experience of browsing a huge selection of artists at a place like this.I'll go here and spend an hour or so until i have a stack of like 6 or 7 CDs, then narrow it down to the best 3 or 4 finds to buy that day.  I've gotten a lot of good deals here and always enjoy myself.  Staff is great.
",1
"I fucking love this place. Its helped me expand my DVD collection tremendously at a cheap price. ZIA is the best place to get the latest art, independent,foreign and new releases on DVD at a great price even if they are used, I have never had a single problem with ANY of the used DVD's I have purchased there. The CD collection is awesome and they usually have hard to find releases that places like Best Buy and Borders dont carry. Some other reviewer said he can get all these things for the same price on Ebay, but who wants to wait for their stuff to come in the mail and spend money on shipping and ending up with scratched materialZIA is the place to be!

"This is a sweet new location. They moved from the 19th Ave & Indian School to camelback. The really cool thing is it's right next to the light rail.The store is an old CVS store, so it's super bright inside with all the cool signs and a massive vinyl section.   I dont think ive ever seen a larger vinyl area in a local store (unless you're vinyl only)Cool people and super awesome staff. Highly recommend!
",1
"I've found good music, and good movies for cheap each time I go into this Zia...  They also have a lot of cool toys!  And the staff has always been really friendly to me.  Thank you Zia!

"I'm old. Yes, just a look at my T&A and you'd think I was a young and fresh Bunny, but sadly the few wrinkles on my face and grey hairs say other wise. Anyway, I remember the first CD I ever bought was Sheena Easton's first and self titled CD. I was so excited that I played that CD over and over. I still feel the same way when I purchase a CD. More so when I purchase a CD at a record store and at a bargain. I love to browse around and listen to the staff's current faves and the recommended new artists at the music listening stations. I have a huge shelves and shelves of CDs and i still get excited when I add another CD to the collection. Support Indie record stores...and old people like myself that prefer old fashion record stores. Cheers***

"This place is just fun. You walk around the large former pharmacy and there's display signs featuring Dave Chappelle as Rick James and a floor-hamburger eating David Hasselhoff. Really solid selection of vinyl records, genres include rock (biggest), r&b, hip-hop and electronic. There's a retro video games section where you can reminisce about your favorite NES cartridge. The DVD selection is ridiculously deep, especially in the tv section. Lots of cool books, gifts and a place where you can make your own t shirt. They offer a trade in section where they acquire their treasures. Behind the trade area there's a wall display with all sorts of Star wars toys still in the box. The prices were fair. Go there it's an experience.

"The radio advertisement for Exile on Main compares this place to the store in the movie High Fidelity and it's hard not to go along with that. Except it's so much more than that! I don't even know if you can get some of these magazines and DVDs at other locations in town. The selection is unique and worth looking through if you're interested in independent music, films, etc.Oh, and you can play Donkey Kong or Joust for free on their vintage arcade machines. And they sell candy! And do PC repairs and upgrades for less than other places!

"I'm so glad we still have a record store in Champaign. Great, helpful staff. If what you're looking for is not in stock, they will order it. Orders are usually in within the week by my experience. They offer a really nice record collection and have great deals (sidewalk sales) on used CDs. Can you find cheaper prices online Sure, but buying here shows support to not only Exile, but Champaign and the downtown area. The town is better for having Exile here...let's keep it that way!

"This is the most ideal local record store I can imagine, and we have it right here in Champaign! A great selection for every kind of person and an owner who should win awards...DAILY! This is the place.

"A locally owned shop for all your audiophile and gaming needs from the past + today.Whenever I need a vinyl that they might not have in stock, I make a special order and within days it's at the store waiting for me. Thank you for keeping my ears happy all these years!

"Independent, awesome, friendly, great selection. Done...  OK... yelps admin wouldn't let me end my review with Done.  Was too short So....  in a long winded kind of way that I don't really like to review things, I really dig what Exile does.  Great events throughout the year in addition to just being a retail spot.  Get your Wax Poetics, Get your game one, Get some god damn records

"Independent local business, knowledgeable staff, great selections and MOUNTAINS OF VINTAGE GOODIES AND YOU CAN STILL ORDER NEW STUFF TOO!if you cant find what you wanted, they will order it for you, or if you are a regular, keep an eye out for a rare item for ya. They also take pre-orders on vinyl and new video games as well, and they video games are the exact same price as Lamestop anyway.The video game selection is amazing and always changing.They have new and used, vintage and modern cds and records for fair prices.They will also take store credit for cool use stuff, so you can trade old records and game for that new game you want if ya got the right stuff at the right time!People keep saying it's expensive, but i disagree. i believe the prices are very fair for their quality, and the cash goes right back into our local economy. i think most people don't understand the cost of local and niche goods. i used to work at a record store, and shipping vinyl is expensive! so if you are used to wal-mart prices, then go there.OH THATS RIGHT wal-mart doesnt carry ANY GOOD MUSIC, let alone support local musicians with events and sell their merch. gee, funny how that works.If you are a treasure hunter, i highly recommend this place. I have found some real gems simply because i was rooting through a random spot in the store.

"Good things do still come in small packages.  If you find yourself in the Elizabeth neighborhood don't neglect to drop in here and check out their selection of new and used CDs and DVDs or just to browse their selection of music-related books, magazines and local news rags.  Park in the back behind the building!When I walked in it brought back memories of my beloved Reckless Records in Chicago.  And I knew I'd found my new sonic home in Charlotte.  It's flanked by a tattoo studio and a pawn shop and admittedly parking is a bit of a pain.  But it's worth the effort (both psychological and automotive) to get a gander at some premium stacks of used music.  If there's a more punk rock shop in this town drop me a line. God save the Queen (City)!!
",1
"Every city needs a good record shop, and thank god Charlotte's got Lunchbox.I admit that I download more than I physically buy music these days, but with Lunchbox so close, I've started buying CDs and records again.  Every time I've gone in, they've had exactly what I was looking for, and the dudes manning the counter are always extremely helpful.This awesome little independent gem is another reason Plaza Midwood is my favorite neighborhood in the Queen City.
",1
"Lunchbox has a great selection of new and used. Every time I go I want to spend all the money in the world, but sadly I can't. Lunchbox Records is easily Charlotte's best record store.
",1
"I can't stress enough how important it is to go into Lunchbox and browse around, especially if you have a hunger (like I do) for hearing the new, interesting and eclectic. The owner, Scott, has poured his heart and soul into giving music fanatics a place in the Charlotte metro where we can go and dick around, dig through the stacks, and find something new and exciting. Record stores like this are hard to come by, you're lucky if your city has one - I know I've seen many good independent record stores hang on and eventually close due to poor sales or community interest. From what I've gathered, Scott has a strong customer base (myself definitely included) and I hope that Lunchbox sticks around for a very long, long time.But enough soapboxing about the state of really good record stores, you want to know what you're going to find there. Ok. So.When your eyes adjust to dim but cozy lighting indoors, you'll probably have a few adjectives spring to mind:1) Small;2) Cluttered; and3) Vinyl.Ok, so Vinyl's not really an adjective in this context. But it's an integral part of what makes Lunchbox so great - Scott collects a wide range of records in every genre imaginable: rock, pop, electronic, jazz, rap, soul, dubstep, IDM, punk, noise, classical, avant-garde, alternative, spoken-word, metal, I don't think I really need to go on. If you want it, they probably have it. If they don't, Scott will order it. The vinyl racks line the walls from front to back and are jam-packed with 12""s, 10""s and 7""s. There's a crate of box sets in the back. There's overstock Record Store Day in the corner. There's a section of new arrivals used vinyl halfway down the left wall and there's a decent stock of used records that you can dig through to your heart's content. The middle section of the store is CD racks - a strong selection of the afore mentioned genres and a decent selection of used CDs as well. It's not a huge used section and it's definitely an eclectic mix - if you're in for a really big used music selection, you should probably check out Manifest - but the stuff I do find there is well worth the time.Prices are really quite good for what you get, especially on the new music. Scott's goal is to sell just enough over cost to make it worthwhile. There's no crazy $6.99 Best-Buy-esque specials on new music but he is able to put some reduced price stuff up from time to time. Your standard-issue CD is going to cost $10-15. Vinyl prices are (as usual) slightly higher than CDs but generally range $15-20 for most releases.What really clinches the deal for me is Scott and his staff - they are great people, they know their stuff, and Scott has never once told me that an album is great just because he wants to sell it. Scott has led me to some absolutely incredible finds and I trust him completely on knowing something new and interesting for me to check out.So please, to get back up on the box, please visit Lunchbox whenever you want to hear something new. Buy it, don't download it, support your local record store and don't be afraid to hear something new. Lunchbox is another absolutely integral piece of the Plaza-Midwood neighborhood, and I'll be distraught if it ever goes away.

"Most people will tell you that vinyl gives a much warmer sound than anything digital - be it CDs or downloaded music.  That may or may not be true.  There are, however, problems with vinyl.The first is that vinyl is a royal pain to keep clean.  Remove an LP from its sleeve, whether it is one you have only just opened or one that you have carefully cared for all of these years, and the chances that it will play all the way through without a single skip are at best 50-50.  Often much less.For most of us regular non-audiophiles, the sound is probably not worth the hassle of dealing with the headaches involved in getting the thing to play: Cleaning each and every side of every LP each time you want to play it, just to have a chance of hearing the whole record.  Setting (and resetting) the stylus.  Removing the record sleeve, then the record.  Reversing the process.  CDs are so much easier, to say nothing of digitized music.Is it better  Very likely.  But is it worth it  That is up to you to decide.Once you have decided that you need some vinyl, there are only so many options left.  In Charlotte, Lunchbox is a great place to go to pick up some old records on the cheap.  I mean really cheap.  In many cases, just a dollar or two for the bargain bin.  Maybe five bucks for something better.  Of course, this is for old releases.  Newer stuff will set you back a bit more (and yes, new content is coming out on vinyl).You can even pick up turntables, both new and used, at Lunchbox, both the traditional kind and the USB sort in case you want to transfer your existing LP collection onto your computer so you never have to deal with those records again.  Note that this process is not simple, but it can be done.Naturally, the problems with vinyl cannot be attributed to Lunchbox - that is inherent in the media.  But if you have decided to make the jump, this is the place to go if you need help, or just want to explore and see if it is for you.  Definitely a resource to have on your list.

"i have found some of my most prized vinyl at lunchbox. they don't carry crap. it seems like a rule. everything on the display is good and on my wish list. they know their demographic! the staff still can seem a bit... judge-y I have been self conscious about my picks before... even though i thought they were awesome. BUT, if you are lucky enough to get the nod of approval, or even a ""great album""... you will feel like you could be head music editor of Rolling Stone. Your self worth shoots through the roof. so maybe it is good that they don't hand those head-nods out like candy. (i got the head nod with Morrisey's ""Viva Hate"" and Bob Dylan's ""The Free wheelin' Bob Dylan""...make note.)

"I live in Charlotte now, and I frequent LunchBox. My bank account my not enjoy it as much as I do....but I freaking love this place! Best record store in town.

"Quality beats quantity.  This store has the highest quality record collection I have seen.  They keep shoppers updated on their newly received new and used records via Twitter and Facebook status which helps to know what is in stock.  This alone keeps them at a higher rating than other record stores in CLT.
",1
"After discovering Lunchbox by my work i have become a weekly visitor it seems. I haven't been into vinyl long but this is the best shop in Charlotte, mainly because of the awesome New selection. Sure Manifest has a massive used section, which is great but their new stuff is nothing compared to tiny Lunchbox. Also a great place to learn about new music too.

"Twenty-three people were in front of us (yes, I count sometimes) waiting for the doors to open at 1:00pm on a weekday and there is not even a concert, no ""New Release"" Party!  This is a popular place!This is my new Favorite place to shop for MusicDVDs and LOOK, which means I'm more than a fan of the patrons here!  In a popular shop this size it is easy to be inspired in very appropriate ways.  If you like what is in here there is a good chance you could meet someone who has similar taste... Enough about dating!They still have bands doing shows here too!  Small Live Music Venue... Very Cool!   For the size of the store they have a GIGANTIC Punk section and even for a store much larger they have a Huge Punk section.  After being here a little while it was easy to understand they only sell the cool Movies and Music.  I found more that I liked here than in several stores combined!  This time I found two DVDs that I thought I may not be able to find so easily and for only $4.00 each, one French and one Thai.  I felt more than lucky, more like Fortunate!

"Ear Wax is THE place to go for buying metal in Madison.  They have a huge selection that spans all sub-genres, definitely with an emphasis on the more extreme sub-genres.  They also have quite a bit of punk, psychobilly, and ambient, although the focus is really on metal.  They also have a good selection of merch (shirts, patches, etc.) although I found the t-shirt selection to be a little skimpy as a person who prefers plain logo T's as opposed to shirts with tons of art on them.  Also, most of the shirts are XL.Ear Wax also has a decent selection of vinyl, DVD's and 'zines, although I've never really checked them out.  The focus is really on CD's.If you are a ""casual"" metal fan who thinks that Slipknot and Trivium are the best the genre has to offer, you will be overwhelmed (and possibly intimidated) upon walking in.  If you aren't a metal fan at all, you won't find anything of interest unless you want a Cannibal Corpse t-shirt for irony purposes.  If you're a die-hard metal fanatic, however, this store is right up your alley.  Every time I go in there I have a hard time limiting myself to only a few purchases because there is so much that catches my eye.  Just about every big metal band is represented, along with a whole bunch that I've never heard of.The price is right (usually around $12 for a CD, $7 used) and the selection is unbeatable.  If you love extreme music, you can't pass up the chance to visit this awesome store.

"When I lived in northern Illinois and made occasional day trips to Madison, Ear Wax is a store that I always made time to stop in.  Not only do they have a great selection of music, but the store owner is knowledgeable and friendly.  He's the kind of guy who deserves your business.  Also, they have a great sticker selection.  What punk rocker doesn't like to put a few on his or her car

"I love Ear Wax. Great selection. New and old.Great customer service as well. Rob is the name of the guy I always see behind the counter. When asked questions about a record or band he doesn't answer in a condescending ""I'm more punkmetal than you' manner. I've asked for his opinions on bandsrecords old and new and he always answers with a knowledgeable and genuine response.This shop is a fucking gem of Madison \m

"They sure do make the most of a small store...er, basement. They owner gave me some freebies and was very helpful. The bi-lingual staff was out smoking and we were left alone digging for some johnny cash, but we compared record stores and curtis mayfield and in general it was very pleasant. The best place to find French and 1960s vinyl. I can see myself spending long hot summer afternoons here.

I had my wedding there and I highly recommend it to everyone else too. Open minded to everyone and all ages. If you are from out of town, go here. Take a camera. Art, flowers, train car, its gorgeous. Their events are so much fun too. Mothers day always has something sweet going on.Go see this special place.

"This place is simply amazing.  If you are ever in the area and looking to just past the time you have to pop in here.  It is actually a park for the city and there is a lot of history behind the actual site itself.The flowers are very nice and they have roses obviously but also lots of other flowers and trees as well.  The center of the yard has an old coal car from when the railroad used to be in service.Parking is easy with a gravel lot right out front.  They also have a few places to rest your feet with bistro tables and benches around.

"Prepare for your mind to be blown. This is one of Charlotte's best secrets.It is on N. Davidson in an industrialsketch area. You walk into this STUNNING garden with plenty of art. It is a delight. You feel like you are transformed into a new place. I cannot recommend this place enough. It feels magical. There are little paths that you can walk to with privacy. There is a large area to be in with a big group. We went for a rehearsal dinner and it was breath taking. I highly recommend going here.

"One of the most wonderful places in the world. Great to go in the winter to feel some humidity and feel better, great for summer to see all the flowers. The gift shop is excellent for any (particularly female) gift occasion. Just a great place to go. Would be great for a date.

"A great place for plant lovers any time of the year!My wife and I come here every winter (if we can) to attend a conference put on by Horticulture Magazine(Fine Gardening).  Olbrich does a nice job with preparation, including the food.Their tropical conservatory is a bit on the small side but the building and plants are very well tended.The various gardens are very well tended.  There are 10 or more theme gardens.  I love their rose garden:  YES WE CAN GROW BEAUTIFUL ROSES IN WISCONSIN.  In fact some roses have been developed by a hybridizer at Olbrich.Olbrich is in a nice area of Madison - close to Lake Monona.

Plus, the conservatory is so nice and warm during the winter!

"Welcome to my backyard.  Oh wait, I'm hallucinating again.But seriously, this place is wonderful.  I love going here, and I do wish my backyard looked like this.Unfortunately for me, I brought a minor with me.  Minor claims to love nature and wants to see it up close and personal, but at the same time is deathly afraid of bees and butterflies.  Most people can understand being fearful of bees and their stings, but butterflies  It's the kind of irrational fear I can only compare to being terribly frightened by a marshmallow.If you were there today, you probably saw the minor racing through the gardens like they were on fire, screaming and crying and begging for mercy from the winged feigns of fiery death and destruction, otherwise known as butterflies.  I thought I could convince minor to hold my hand and ""trust"" that I wouldn't let anything bad happen, but apparently I'm a lousy saleswoman andor my evil plot to feed innocent children to flying insects was all too apparent.  Dang!!!Minor covered the grounds in record time and was back at the lobby begging to leave.  A wave of relief washed over minor's face when we were safely back in the confines of the car, far far away from the flying death stingers and soul crushing, face smashing butterflies of satan.But other than that, this is a lovely place when we are not there.  Thank you and goodnight.

"One of the greatest treasures of Madison. There's no better place to simply relax and enjoy the beauty and variance of nature. The only downside: the inevitable disrespectful patrons. Particularly when it comes to the Thai Pavilion. Usually this means people with kids, but just as often applies to adults that can't seem to understand the words ""Please don't touch"".

"Absolutely gorgeous!We arrived in Madison a little late on a Thursday afternoon and decided to try to make it to the Botanical Garden and squeeze a walk in before it closed.  We, unknowingly, got there at the perfect time - 6:30 pm in the summer yielded some BEAUTIFUL pictures as the sun was a little softer (and not as hot).We strolled around, hand in hand on our anniversary vacation - it was romantic, quiet, and I felt like I was taking deep breaths for the first time in a very long time.I cannot recommend this beautiful sanctuary enough

"This is truly a beautiful place and a treasure for Madison.  Please don't ever leave us.  Be sure to check out the herb garden in the fall.  Amazing variety of scents.  The varieties of  geranium are amazing.  Lemon, chocolate, mint, vanilla, pepper, cinnamon, turmeric... well you get the picture.

"The Desert Botanical Gardens are an oasis in the local sea of strip malls and desert.  Many and varied plant areas, including an oasis and desert.  Summer evening flashlight tours are worth the price of membership.

"The place to go when you need to see a cactus. Or hundreds of them, along with a variety of other desert plants. I went here with my digital camera and came back with a bunch of photos worth printing. The garden is extremely well-kept and is easily accessable. Admission is cut in half for students, so don't forget that ID card.

"this is the perfect time of year to visit DBG.in spring they start their spring jazz in the garden series (every firday night) with food and cash bar beverages.you can take painting classes, just stroll around, and now they have this awesome art installation piece made of twigs that you can actually go inside of (completed Feb. 23).i've been coming here since i was a little 'un and i love coming back. especially if you're a native, you'll love the ""desert rain"" ... machine it's basically a strainer with creosote and other desert plant leaves inside, and you turn on the shower fountain head and get an instant whiff of true monsoon season desert rain smell...it's amazing!

"Of course, there is cactus. But there is SO much more to the Desert Botanical Garden than Organ Pipe and Saguaro...The gardens are well thought out and always well maintained. Watch for jackrabbits and a wide variety of birds. Now is the perfect time of year for a visit, as there will be wildflowers and cacti in bloom and the weather isn't too hot yet. But even in the summer, it's a nice city escape. Just wear a hat & sunscreen and try to go first thing in the morning. There are drinking fountains around every turn and plenty of shade. Try a guided tour if you have the time or are playing host to out-of-town guests. The guides are friendly and extremely knowledgeable. Even if you've lived in AZ all your life (like me) you are bound to learn something new.

"I just got back from an Arizona spring training vacation, and one of the highlights was definitely the Desert Botanical Gardens.  We came really close to skipping on a visit altogether because it was 5:00pm, but decided to give it a shot...it was worth it!  I was a little disappointed that the Butterfly Pavillion had closed for the day at 5:00pm, and several walking areas were being used for weddingsreceptions (who could blame these people) but still got to see a lot of beautiful desert plants and wildlife.  We managed to get in for free, not sure if it was because of the time of the day or all the people just walking in for the weddings though, which totally made the park that much more fun.  I am not sure I would have gotten as much enjoyment out of it if I'd had to pay $5 to get in...The little desert rat-sqirrels, and rabbits were totally fun to try to find hiding in the many different plants and burrows.  I felt like a little kid ooh-ing and ah-ing at the different varieties of cacti and desert wildflowers, and have to give this place the ultimate rating .  If you're ever in Arizona, please give this place a try, it's very well put together and a beautiful site to see.

"I am not usually a fan of botanical gardens. They seem too precious, too ""perfect"" to be of much interest. And, let's face it, flowers and plants are beautiful things, but when you pay to look at them in neat rows, something is lost.That said, Desert Botanical Gardens is an exception to this garden cynic. Many of these cacti look like they are from another planet, like something you would see in a sci-fi film and say, ""wow, it's too bad those crazy plants don't exist."" They sprawl out on the ground, weaving and turning every which way, or compose huge bizarre formations high off the ground. I never knew such bizarre life forms existed, or that some cacti look like trees.The gardens are full of windy paths where one is also likely to find a family of quail, lizards, or a jackrabbit or two. Various species of bird can be seen here as well, especially at dusk. I especially love watching the birds fly in and out of nests they've made in the upper arms of cacti.This place never grows old. It's a great introduction to the desert for people from out of town, and because the cacti have been collected from around the world, a cool botany lesson for us all here.

"The Desert Botanical Gardens in Phoenix, AZ is a great way to get a sample of Arizona's diverse and spectacular flora.  Check out The Gardens in the spring, when all of the plant and flowers are blooming in beautiful, vibrant colors.  This is a great place to take visiting relatives who love to garden or are just nature buffs.   It's an easy walking adventure with many cozy benches to sit and bird or nature watch.  Midway through the journey is a nice spot to enjoy a little refreshment and sample some yummy treats.  At the end of your journey is a great gift shop with books, jewelry and even plants found on the garden grounds for sale.  Visit when the day time temperatures are moderate and you're guaranteed to have an enjoyable time.  Be sure to wear sunscreen and bring a camera.  Don't forget to have fun!

"More of a man's garden . . . . When I lived in Phoenix (a couple years ago) the Papago Park Desert Botanical Gardens was one of my favorite places to take out-of-town visiting friends and relatives. You tell them ""HEY, LET'S GO TO THE BOTANICAL GARDENS!""  They grumble a little, especially the men. They, of course, expect rose gardens, tulip beds, lavendar and Queen Anne's Lace.  WRONG!  It is a fifty acre garden of beautiful cacti and succulents . . . . beautiful desert plants! But no whoosy northern plants needing moisture here. These are desert survivors. Desert rats! Desert birds! Desert songs! Desert life!A man's garden of delights . . . tough masculine desert plants here, but with delicate beautiful flowers.Gardening help, botanical research & education, workshops, event facilities, taste of the desert tours, Monarch Butterfly exhibit, garden tours, special music, art and romantic evening events, children's events. So much to do & see, so little time . . . . . even a man will love it here!There is ALWAYS something going on at the PAPAGO PARK DESERT BOTANICAL GARDENS.  I can't make up my mind whether to go down for the ""SAHNAS BROTHERS SPANISH GUITAR"" event in February or wait for the ""AGAVE ON THE ROCKS"" in March. Hmmm . . . . which one which one which one Can't do both . . . . Check it out.  www.dbg.org  TELL ME WHAT TO DO.  Friends are expecting me  . . . . it is cooler in Phoenix in February than it is in March . . . . maybe I should let the weather dictateNo matter the temperature, this is not a place to miss. A delight of the possibilities of our world. Every size, shape and kind of cacti & succulent from around the world is here. Check it out!www.dbg.org

"I love this place!  After spending a morning there I was ready to sign up for a yearly membership.  Who knew there were so many different types of cactus  Its really interesting to see them all and learn about their place within the desert ecosystem.   You feel as if you are transported to a world many miles away from Phoenix (just move the telescope a little if a building gets in your line of sight) and its a perfect place to bring an out of town guest as I am positive they have nothing like it where they are from.The seasonal butterfly exhibit is fantastic, it reminded me of my third grade classroom where we had Monarch butterflies just flying around.  (My teacher was a little bit of a hippie)  It doesn't have to take up a whole day if you don't want it to and you can explore at your own pace.  Come spring time I'm sure that the wildflower portion is beautiful.  I'm very excited to go back for the Las Noches de las Luminarias.

"Easily one of my favorite places in urban Phoenix. I am a member and we go often. What is there not to like Its unique. It changes. There are events by a bundle. Even food is semi OK, for such place. Go there! No i mean it. Go! Stroll through major ""Roads"", venture to some smaller once, talk to those nice elderly (For the most part) volunteers who will teach you about surviving on Prickly Pears or how Succulent is different from a Cactus.Do not liter, run around or yell like an idiot, please. Besides that - HAVE FUN! This place is awesome. ""I like""""Very nice""Eugene

"I must say this place puts both of the conservatories in Chicago as well as the domes in Milwaukee to shame.   It is old, classy, large, varied and their spring flower show -- we caught the last weekend -- was not only beautiful but original and clever.  Should be considered one of the highlights of Pittsburgh.
",1
"I took my mother to Phipps during her first visit to Pittsburgh earlier this month (April 2007) for the Spring flower show.  It was a great way to showcase the city and it really impressed her (and me!)  The flowers were great, and the food in the cafe was fantastic (and very vegetarian friendly).  I've heard their butterfly gardens are great too, though they weren't open at the time.A must-see!
",1
"I was just here for an absolutely stunning Chihuly exhibit. Amazing! Don't miss it! Best part of our trip.I have high standards too because I'm familiar with Longwood Gardens near Philadelphia. Looks like the place is a bit lacking in flowering plants if the exhibit wasn't there. But still really neat and worth a visit.
",1
"Woah, I figured I must have reviewed Phipps. But I haven't!I'm not a flower guy. I mean, they're ok and all, but I never figured I'd enjoy going to a flower garden. But I love Phipps. Everything is really well done, and they don't care if you just stroll for a while. The butterfly exhibit is really awesome - just go during the day, because during the evening they're all sleeping. Carnegie Mellon students get in for free, so for four years, I had the perfect date spot. It's free! It's next to campus! You seem more sensitive than if you suggested you watch Grindhouse.
",1
"A Pittsburgh gem. I recently joined The Phipps because I am always impressed with the exhibits and my visit always puts me in a good mood. I've been at the Phipps in all seasons and attended a couple of the special events (New Year's Eve and Chihuly exhibit). Always something interesting to see.No reasonably priced postcards. That is a real shame.
",1
"They always have great shows, plant shows. Wow - imagine how I'd kick my own ass if I'd heard me say that just 15 years ago - their plant shows are awesome! **punch**Anyhow they really are. I love to photograph the flowering plants and it is a great place to take a client to in order to photograph them at as long as you go when Phipps is not too busy or crowded.

"Phipps Conservatory is another one of the many outstanding cultural amenities in Pittsburgh.  I wonder if my fellow natives realize the wealth of culture this city has.Anyway, I took a week's worth of annual leave from work and decided to make the must of our cultural institutions.  So I asked my friend Marla, a stay-at-home mom if she'd like to join me here for a day.  Marla practically dialed her mother to ask her to babysit even before I was done talking to her!One thing I like is that if you only have a little bit of time, you can visit the Sustainable Perennial Gardens, right around the dome of the Phipps.  I believe that you can visit this part for free.  But the Sustainable Perennial Gardens shows you how you can plant flowers and plants that require little water, fertilizer, and pesticides.It would be too hard for me to list all of the rooms that Phipps has.  I guess my favorite is the Fern Room, which has a lot of prehistoric plants and tree ferns, many of which have been around since the time of the dinosaurs.  I also enjoy the Tropical Fruit Spice Room and the Tropical Forest Conservatory.  It is in these rooms that we are reminded of one of the reasons that the rainforests are so so important to us.  Not only is the biodiversity so great, but we get so many of our fruits and spices from them.  Take a moment to deeply inhale this fragrant room!  We also get so many medicines from the rainforest and this place has a research lab and a ""Healer's Hut"".Marla's favorite exhibits are the Desert Room and the Japanese Courtyard Garden.  I can see her point.  Japanese gardens are intended to be places of tranquility.  The Phipps also has a huge outdoor garden and I'm glad that we had the nice weather last week.  It gave us one last chance to walk through the walkways and the beautiful fountains before they're closed for the winter.Oh, and we saw this guest speaker http:www.youtube.comwatchv=o7Ixe95CZOE  I'M JUST KIDDING!  But seriously, the Phipps can be a wonderful, colorful, and relaxing way to spend the day.  Even if you don't have a ""green thumb"", you'll find something to like here!

"Nothings puts me in the holiday spirit more that a visit to Phipps Winter Flower Show. I love all the cute ""animal"" displays and the poinsettias, hanging baskets and the Xmas trees are beautiful and fragrant. I love how they manage to fill the Serpentine Room with such nice holiday displays. My favorite room is always the Orchid Room. There are so many different varieties and I love to be able to see them up close and marvel at their beauty. I also love the Tropical Forest Conservatory. It's so peaceful and tranquil. I love the Sunken Garden and The Victoria Room, too. Also, the Broderie Room was also very beautiful in it's holiday decor. I can't wait to visit again in the Spring!

"i wish that every city had a place like this, so that in the dead of winter i could trudge through the snowy streets of boston and walk into a beautiful victorian greenhouse. if you're visiting pittsburgh, phipps should be at the top of your things to see.

"This place exudes cheer in an understated way.If you're in Pittsburgh for a weekend or longer, this should be one of The Places To Visit.  It's rarely crowded, it's inexpensive, and every room in the building is an awesome collection of plants.  Flowers, cactus, palm trees, orchids, with the seasonal butterfly room off to the side, and a great display around Christmastime.Comparing it to botanical gardens in larger cities, it's bigger than the one in Washington, DC if that matters to ya.  Reading the reviews, it never even occurred to me that not all cities have one of these.  Hunh.

"BELLAGIO CONSERVATORY (only)The conservatory was amazing this past weekend!! I don't know how people do it so well, but whoever it is that the hotel hires each year to omit just the right amount of ""holiday fragrance"" into the air, both in the hotel and the conservatory, does an excellent job. This year, the air was filled with notes of vanilla and cinnamon.  Last yeat, it was more pine.  Anyways, this was the firs time I was able to take my mother to see the conservatory.  The first piece that we looked at was a huge reindeer covered in pecans and adorned with all other types of flowers, roses, greenery, and even some dried flowers.  Water was creating the illusion of canopy type wiring that would be used to attach flowers and things.  it's hard to explain.  there was a little water show going on in one of the exhibits.  there were so many beautiful pointsettas and even some more interesting, moving pieces to the displays. in one of them were several penguins in what was an adorable arctic scene.  it was too cute. you had to see it yourself. anyway, it was very fun to see all of this going on. i love that it's open 247 and that it's such an elaborate display. i'm a fan of this conservatory. you should check it out if you've never seen it before!! it is definitely a sight to see.

"This place is great to check out anytime of year!!! It's always so beautiful and amazing w what they have on display each time I come here.  The last time I was here was in October and they had a really cute display for Autumn...a nice little bridge that goes through the greenery and water fountains that shoot up and over the bridge as you're walking through...& a GIANT bucket of bright green, red and yellow apples flowing from it! It was amazing!!! (check out the pix i posted!)It's a great spot for photos especially during the holidays and the greatest part about it is that it's FREE!!! =)

"This place is absolutely beautiful. There was this butterfly theme when we went and it provided some interesting photo-ops. This place is a must when in Vegas. So what are you doing Go check it our for yourself!

"Completely amazing and beautiful every time I've visited. I have no idea how they find the time and artistry to pull off changing the theme every season, but it's so great! I make it a point to visit every time I go to Vegas. Last time I went, butterflies were the theme. They even had a tiny greenhouse filled with live butterflies! So pretty. This time, Fall flowers, pumpkins, waterfall trees, and large animated forest creatures filled the space. It's the perfect place to stop and just enjoy something in Vegas that has nothing to do with drinking or gambling. Plus, there's tons of background for photo ops. The only downside It gets crowded, of course.

"The Conservatory at the Bellagio was beautiful when I visited in November 2008.  Since it was the fall, the conservatory had an autumn theme with wood nymphs and fall flowers and pumpkins.  It presents the perfect photo op for tourists and thus can be quite crowded.  Around the corner is the patisserie where you can buy some gelato or a crepe and return to peruse the conservatory.

"Living plants and fauna inside a casino.  It is awesome.  Just WILD... and I want to know what they do to protect the poor trees from the tourists, smoke, and awful, awful Chihuly shops.  What a hack.Okay the chocolate stand around the corner with the huge chocolate waterfall was... well... I couldn't stop saying ""Augustus!!!""The christmas decorations make it quite quaint, and the little walkway that had tourists marching alongside Nutcracker replicas 14' tall.  They looked like cows marching to the abattoir, plus the snowmen, etc was incredibly festive.Lovely.Not sure if it hit me right, frankly.Anyhoo... I have seen the room at day and night with and without the consumer driving holiday stimulus (people see ornaments and freak out and need to shop).....I like it.  A LOT.  It is living earthy grooviness inside a terrible naughty casino (which can also be nice).So... visit it.  IT IS THE ONLY FREE THING IN VEGAS.  Besides dudes who click cards with their fingers for stripshows.Those guys *ARE* Vegas.

"Gorgeous holiday decorations when we were there (early December 2008). It was pretty packed but what a joy to see. Check out my pictures!

"You could theoretically walk through it without realizing you're walking through it.  The Bellagio as a whole is so oppulently decorated that you may just figure you've wandered into a particularly plant-filled section and pay it no mind.Rest assured, you're in an actual Conservatory.  That's managed, pruned, and decorated.  Great for pictures, decorated for holidays and a generally pleasant distraction from the smoky casino floor.

"Beautiful! The Bellagio Conservatory is a must see for anyone visiting Vegas. As a Hawaii resident, LAS is a home away from home for island folks. We stopped by in Nov 2008 to take in the fall displays. Amazing use of natural products. It was a nice way to kick-off the holiday season.

"This is a truly amazing oasis in a sea of cheese and debauchery.  Since we were sans little wee one on our naughty adult vacation to Sin City, we decided to pop over to the Springs Preserve and check it out.  It's a relatively new desert botanical garden and learning center.  Hubby is a science teacher so he was WAY excited to get his science groove on.We went a little later than expected and only had a couple hours to spend but we easily could have spent at least 4 hours wandering the hiking trails and checking out the cool exhibits.  Basically this attraction has three parts...origin experience which has tons of cool interactive activities, films, and a little zoo of desert life, Desert Lving Center which is all about conservation, and GardensTrails which is a bunch of interconnected trails.  It was really cold when we were there so we didn't spend as much time as we like on the trails.If you have some time and want to get away for a bit from the smoke and vice of the Strip, check out the Springs Preserve. It's really lovely.

"Only a few blocks from my apartment, I expected this place to be out in the middle of nowhere or on the edge of town.  Today was the one-year anniversary of Spring's Preserve, so I treated my roommate, my son and I to attend the event (the fact that it cost $6 each instead of $14.95 was a major reason why I was so nice).  While the crowds were outrageous today, it did not detract from what the Preserve has to offer overall.There are many different facets of this huge campus, from the OriGEN experience to the gardens on the outskirts of the property; each has something great to show and tell you.  We started in the gardens, examining the flora and fauna that is prevalant in this area.  We were shown various ways to create a garden using plants that are meant to be here as well as planting veggies and fruits in new and interesting ways, something I did not think could be done well around here.We ventured further into the Preserve and found the ampitheater where a free ice-cream social was coinciding with live Celtic and eventually Blues musicians performing.  What a great place this would be for a night of music and some food or drinks.  We were told that the next week on Father's day there would be a BBQ, Blues and Beer festival where the first 100 dad's got in for free.  Events like this are an excellent way to attract positive attention to such a wonderful place.Past the ampitheater is the OriGEN building where there are a multitude of displays that are interactive and interesting.  Educational video games occupy one room while a history of the area display with live actors playing a turn-of-the-century train ride scene are in another.  Beyond this room lies one of the most exciting parts of the experience: the Flash Flood room.  Only 30 people can go in at a time, so expect a line.  Standing on a platform at the bottom of a mock wash, you experience what it is like to be in the middle of a flash flood.  My son was in the front row and he came out a little wet.Further along you will find a great insect, reptile and mammal display that has many interesting specimens.  We found that a few of the animals were dead, however, but this is not to be unexpected.  One was a kangaroo mouse that was hidden away in his burrow (he may have been sleeping but we doubt it.  The lizards were very excited to have visitors as you may see in one of the pictures I posted of the Preserve.Expect to spend at least 2-3 hours here.  A lot of the activities are outside, so apply sunscreen.  Water fountains are every where and most are very cold (moreso near the buildings).  We did not go into the main building where the gift shops and restaurants were, but refer to other reviews as other yelper's have visited them.  I will update when I return here again.

"I would have to say this is probably the best way you can spend a nice afternoon. there's a lot of fun games and the landscape is beautiful. if you're looking for a place to go on a date, this is it!!!it's way cute!!after coming here once, i thought it was so pretty, i decided to do my photo project here. there's a lot to learn here. if you're into the whole saving the environment thing, you'll LOVE it. i think its definitely worth paying to get into the different buildings.

"One of my favorite places in Vegas! If you are visiting here and are not into gambling, this is a nice alternative. Here you can learn about our ecosystem and cultural history, enjoy art, and walk through some pretty nice trails! They also have some great exhibits and workshops supporting sustainable living.

"I LOVE THIS PLACE. How can you not enjoy the center of where Las Vegas started. The best part about this place is the Wolfgang Puck balcony cafe where we get our favorite Kobe Burger and Fries. I think it's the best in Vegas. Juicy medium burger. The tender buttery meat really melts in your mouth. The fries are long and crisp when you bite into them. Very Gourmet.  Come here for July 4th and watch the scattered fireworks along the 10 mile strip with the Las Vegas Philharmonic playing in the background. You can definitely find us here at least once a month.

"Update 06-Jan-10   The last time we visited the Springs Preserve, it was in the middle of a very hot summer day.  So we couldn't really spend much time outside.   But we vowed to come back in the winter and I am really glad we did.   The indoor displays are really pretty neat.   But being able to see the outside displays and nature trails was just awesome.   It was kind of nice to just walk around in the cool air.  It was like a small slice of nature in the city.   Great job guys!

"Living in Hawaii, you pretty much are limited to the things you can doplaces you can see, well, other than sunning at our beautiful beaches and everything outdoors!  For families in Hawaii, there is the usual, ""you-can-never-go-wrong-with"" Waikiki Zoo or Waikiki Aquarium, etc. to frequent, at least a million times in your lifetime (or your kids' lifetimes).Here in Las Vegas, the place to take the family is the Springs Preserve!  Heck!  Better yet!  Get an annual membership there!  You will never tire of the place!  The place is packed with so much to do!  The Springs Preserve is not your typical museum.  In a nutshell, it is a cultural institute of Las Vegas' history and its move towards a promising future of sustainability with all its natural resources that is available in Las Vegas.Who said that learning is not fun!  There is so much to learn about Las Vegas and you can find it here.  The one thing I, as well as my 8-year old son, have learned about the most, for instance, is the creation and history of the aquifers in the valley.  Yes, you heard that right.  There is water in this here desert!From classes and workshops to events and concerts, the Springs Preserve offers a wealth of information - and they do it in such a fun and natural way!  What we like best of all are the live desert animal exhibits to view, the gardens to stroll through and trails to walk, and the kids' playground area to rest and relax in.  And when it's time to grab a bite, you can't go wrong with the Springs Cafe By Wolfgang Puck.We just renewed our annual membership which, for families, is $60, basic value package, or $25 for individuals.  We were just there last night for the Haunted Harvest, a festival of games, trick or treatin', performances and fun!  They even had a haunted maze!  We can't wait to go back for their next spectacular holiday event...The Winter Lights Festival!  It's gonna be beautiful and amazing as ever!!!  See you all there!!!

"One of my top favorite places to be in Vegas.  Extremely beautiful gardens and nostalgic museums.  The art and architecture is impressive and the staff has always been friendly.

"If we're being completely honest in our choice of terms, there are few ""world-class"" destinations in any given city. The Biodome is one such place in Montreal. Where else can you walk through 4 ecosystems in 1-2 hours and really get a feel for each one's particularitiesWhere else can you learn something on every visit, whether you're 2, 16, 35, or 60 years old Where else takes an already awesome concept and execution and creates special theme events to make the experience even more amazing Yeah, I'm talking about the night visits where you get to see things in a completely different light - if you'll forgive the pun. The Biodome is one of Montreal's ""must sees"". If you're visiting, just go. If you're lucky enough to live here (and sometimes I need a reminder about that) go and take in the experience, and then start thinking of your return trip. I am constantly amazed, and proud of this world class Montreal site.

"What a great place to visit. This is the coolest reused building I've ever been into (it was the Velodome of the '76 Olympic Games). The habitats were well put together and the animals seemed to have enough space to hide and be seen. The rainforest is really really hot, the bat exhibit was cool (and scary) and the penguins were delightful. I loved how the birds could all fly and that it actually rained in parts of the dome. It is an AZA accredited facility and the docentskeepers were all very helpful. I will definitely be back on our next trip to Montreal.

"This is a WOW...WOW...place...a must visit for all tourists of Montreal...the habitats are very well established....the animals feel more natural...the temperature is controlled for each habitat...moving from the rainy, humid, dim lighted tropical forests to the others...the animals are not enclosed except for fishesbats nd penguins :P...but they are at a safe height or distance...you wouldnt find lions or tigers...but whatever they have its enough to keep you feel that its worth the money spent...

"We walked in to the conservatory proper, and immediately I felt like I was in Eden. A pair of butterflies fluttered by as soon as we entered. A wave of humidity hit me and my surroundings all of a sudden became lush and green. I was stunned by the birds and butterflies that roamed freely throughout the small conservatory. It was an awesome feeling and there's nothing else like it! If you're still enough, the butterflies will obliviously land on you. There's an area where the butterfly chrysalises hang and, if you're lucky, you'll even see butterflies emerging from their slumber.
",1
"Relaxing, well thought out greenspace. Various different areas, each with its own character. You can be busy with other people or find a secluded shelter for some peace and quiet. watch out for the kamikaze squirrels though! Wonderful glasshouse, but with an entry fee. Cafe a bit expensive so bring a lunch.Some nice events take place here so watch out for those.
",1
"There is something special about being able to step into a building from a busy, bustling and noisy city center - and be transported to a quiet, alive and organic rainforest of plants, trees and flowers.The Royal Botanic Garden is one such way that you can experience this feeling - the gardens, located in the city center are huge, spread out across a massive piece of land, and both indoors in a huge green house, and out in the gardens outside. The Garden is particularly pleasent in the summer, where the sun shines, the flowers bloom and generally you will feel one with nature. There is nothing better than spending a lazy day here, just wandering about admiring the plants and watching the world go by.
",1
"I have mentioned in previous reviews than I am very green fingered indeed, I just love foliage, so Royal Botanic Gardens was always going to be a winner in my book. Established in 1670 the Royal Botanic Gardens is very lush indeed and up there with the finest display of shrubbery in the world. Picture perfect on a summer's day when all the flowers are in bloom. It is absolutely free to enter and did you know that the largest palm tree in any greenhouse in Britain is housed right here That was your useless fact of the day. In addition to this there's also the famous rock garden and an award winning collection of rhododendrons.

"As a lover of rich vegetation, a lover of ponds, and a lover of swans, there's only ever going to be one result in my review for The Botanic Gardens. It's a wonderful way to spend a sunny day, and far more civilised and tranquil than the cider-swilling meadows.At a B&B in Oban I once saw some prizewinning rhododendrons, and the bad boys on show in here are the first I've seen that could compete with the finest the rural West Coast has to offer. So full of wonderful purple colour they actually stain the surrounding leaves.Now that's proper horticulture for you.

"I've been visiting The Botanic Garden ever since I was knee high and it never ceases to capture my imagination and wonder. From it's Palm houses to Inverleith House at the heart of the Gardens, every acre is filled with peace and tranquility in the middle of this metropolis. I now take my kids to the Gardens and to see them feed the squirrels and pigeons and to tumble and rush through the fallen leaves in Autumn as I used to do myself is priceless.

"The Botanic Gardens are beautiful and a real gem within Edinburgh, it is free entry so you really have got nothing to lose by coming here, no matter what time of the year you go.Obviously the Spring and the Autumn are the best times to go where you can see all the flowers in full bloom or to see the beautiful display the trees put on in September. However, even if you go in the Winter, the greenhouses are kept at really humid conditions allowing all types of plants to prosper as well as giving you somewhere nice and warm to go in the cold months!The gardens are well kept and are very clean and there is a cafe towards the middle of the area if you want to stop for a cup of coffee and a snack. The grounds are also very easy to navigate around due to an abundance of signs and maps.

"I love this place for the pigeons and squirrels, they are friendly and love getting fed, many will pose for photos and eat from your hand

"The Botanic Garden in Edinburgh is about as close to heaven as it's possible to get in the city.  Outstandingly beautiful and peaceful with an attractive array of wildlife, including some very friendly squirrels who will eat out of your hand if you're patient enough - though be warned they will bite if they feel threatened.There is a restaurant on the grounds which is ridiculously overpriced and a not inexpensive shop, but the shop is good for souvenirs and if you take a picnic with you there are plenty of places you can enjoy it.  The arboretum is spectacular, though not cheap, but you don't need to visit it to enjoy the gardens and entrance is free.My favourite part has to be the Chinese garden with its bamboo and waterfalls, though there are plenty of nooks and crannies to explore and you can easily spend an entire day out there.  Not to be missed.

"This place was absolutely incredible.  I visited in late March, but it seems to be the kind of place that has a different style of beauty at different points.  I'll talk about my two favorite parts: the greenhouse gardens and the general gardens (specifically the 'rock hill garden')Walking into each greenhouse was like discovering a whole new world.  Ranging from tropical rooms covered in brilliant flowers and lush vines to a desert room with cactus.  My only regret is that I wasn't able to run around and frolic among the plants like a little kid.  I have to say my favorite greenhouses were probably 8 and 10.  8 had a ton of carnivorous plants and orchids (which are awesome) and 10 had an Amorphophallus Titanum, a plant that grows an absolutely gigantic flower. Unfortunately it is in the beginning stages of this years growth, but that's just an incentive to come back :)The rock hill garden was both visually stunning and a great place for children to play.  While I was there, a wedding was being held and children were running around having a wild time.  If you have kids, take them here, they will love it.  From the top of the hill, you can see the Edinburgh skyline, complete with castle. Trust me its worth seeing.

"Bit too many rhododendrons for me. But - am I going to knock a star off what is a lovely tranquil space to spend a day Not I, said the fly. I haven't visited RBGE since I was kneehigh to a lawnmower, when we went to the glasshouses to learn about the rainforest and the threat to it's existence (how times have changed, eh eh) and tried dried mango for the first time. Roll on twenty-something years, and it's taken into our heads to revisit. And it really hasn't changed in any way. It's still beautiful, although I swear it was all indoors the last time I visited! Honest! For the tourist wanting to do something not directly on the main drag, or the local wanting somewhere pleasant to picnic in the town, you can't really go wrong. Enjoy.

"As the reviews of Casbah appear to be particularly long-winded ... the place is nice, fancy, organic-ish, alternating menu, nice atmosphere. Good date restaurant. Good food-lovers restaurant.
",1
"I went to Casbah for brunch, it's a $22 prix-fix, which includes an alcoholic bev, an appetizer and an entree. They use amazingly fresh and yummy fruits and veggies. I had the house made granola which was just amazing! Toasty and sweet, it was nothing like the granola you get out of a box. Also, while the food is totally fru-fru (in only the best way :) and it's a pricey brunch, you get a lot a food. After the great pastry basket, my appetizer, a Bellini and a cup of coffee, I had two bites of my omelette and took the rest in a doggy bag (""the rest"" included fruit salad, potatoes, and a croissant!)My only complaint would be how long everything took. While I love a leisurely meal, an hour and a half for brunch seemed a bit excessive. I go into brunch groggy, then I have coffee and yummy food, and I'm totally amped, ready to face the day! And then I get to sit. And wait. Anyway, it's totally not a big deal, now I'll know to make time the next time I go. Which is for dinner for a friends birthday. So excited!!

"I was pleased to finally find a place in Pittsburgh that's worth it for me to spend some money. I tire of eating out only to become dissatisfied knowing I could have made the meal better myself. Not here.The food is made to order, seasonal, local, some organic...in short, they actually care about the quality of the food which is becoming a rare trait in restaurants today. I had made it a point to never eat fish in a Pittsburgh restaurant but Casbah changed my mind. The cod dish I had was delicious--not overcooked, breaded, too oily or too salty! Decor is subtle and great for a date. Service was friendly and accommodating.  I will most definitely return!

"Great great for parties and celebrations of all kinds.  The wait staff is extremely knowledgeable of the menu and the wine list.  The Food is creative and many of the items are organic or locally grown.  Everything is so fresh and pretty, you almost don't want to eat it.  The wine list is extensive, and although it can be pricey, they have great happy hour specials.

"This is my favorite Big Burrito restaurant and definitely one of my favorite restaurants in the country. Gotta be honest, though. Just about every time I'd been here, it's with colleagues, which means lots and lots of boozing!! Therefore, consequently, as a result, in sum, I don't have a crystal clear memory of what I had for appetizer, entree, dessert, etc. What I can tell you is that I had never been disappointed with anything I've ordered here. And believe you me, if the food is not that good, I will remember it no matter how drunk I am. Sure, it's not exactly a ""Mediterranean"" restaurant, but who cares The food is great, it's in a super cute hood, the atmosphere is cozy and comfy, and the service is always spot on. I do recall that the very last time I ate here was with a dear friend and two of her British colleagues, and we had ourselves a grand ol' time. I had the arugula --one of my favorite words. It's lovely, no Say it with me. A -ru-gu-la! Fun, right!! And so flavorful!! --salad and cioppino, which was outstanding with super freshy fresh ingredients. What about dessert, you ask Sorry, kids. By that time I really was drunk, and I can't remember. It was super tasty, though! I remember everyone liking mine the best. Sure do, sugar!So pay no mind to others' taxonomy quip and give this place a whirl. It's a great date or small group place. Oh, and super fantastic wine list, too!

"Excellent place for brunch.  For $22, I had a mimosa; cheese, fruit, and baguette slices; a waffle with berries and whipped cream; two pieces of bacon; and a muffin, scone, and biscuit with honey butter from the bread basket.  Service was pretty good even though the restaurant was fairly busy.  Reservations available through Open Table.  This is definitely a special occasion brunch, but it is surprisingly affordable.

"One of my all time favorite restaurants in Pgh, Casbah is still going strong 15 years later. Today's lunch was a wonderful mac and cheese with braised lamb; my dining companion enjoyed the corn risotto with shitake mushrooms and a side heirloom tomato salad. They use the best fresh local ingredients to craft some of the most delectable, interesting fresh food around.  Also great for Sunday brunch.  You won't be disappointed.

"Excellent excellent brunch spot.  For review 100, a 5 star review for a 5 star restaurant is definitely fitting.Casbah does brunch, lunch and dinner, but brunch is my favorite meal and also what they do best.  I ordered their prixe fixe brunch option which is a choice of an appetizer, brunch dish, and drink for $22.  I started off with smoked salmon and had the waitress recommended braised lamb and eggs as an entree and a mimosa to drink.  My companion ordered butternut squash & apple cider soup, wild mushroom omelet, and a glass of fresh orange juice.While waiting for our food, we munched on their complimentary pastry basket consisting of super moist mini-muffins, scones, and super rich and buttery biscuits with honey butter.The smoked salmon came with capers, minced red onion, crumbled egg, a drizzle of aioli, and a beautiful fried potato cake.  There was just the perfect amount of everything on the dish; the potato cake was just big enough to balance out the saltiness of the smoked salmon and the capers of course paired beautifully with the smoked salmon.  I tried some of the butternut squash & apple cider soup and it had some a pretty complex flavor.My entree reminded me of an eggs benedict with a twist: grilled  sourdough topped with spinach, braised lamb shoulder and two poached eggs.  I love braised meats because braising can do such wonders to tougher cuts.  The braised lamb shoulder was flavorful, tender, and super rich.  The best part about poached eggs is sopping up the extra yolk with bread and it just tasted better with the sauce of the lamb soaking into the sourdough to soften it up a bit.  This dish itself is enough to make me a regular.  I tried my companion's home fries which came with this slightly spicy ketchup (I think it's house-made) and also a piece of her omelet which was pretty good too.Service was good, ambiance was good, portions were big, quality was excellent, AND they take reservations.  Sometimes I don't mind waiting the half hour it takes to get seats at some restaurants (Point Brugge, Coca Cafe, etc.), but most times I'd rather spend time with people in the restaurant at a table rather than waiting outside, especially now with winter approaching.

"Such a pleasure to dine, on my birthday, at a restaurant with such good food and cocktails right in Shadyside. We planned in advance to come here after I received Big Burrito's free-entree birthday voucher** and after  coming here to sample dessert and drinks. The food--short rib ravioli, lamb and polenta, pumpkin cake with ice cream and toffee--was insanely rich and tasty and decadent, perfect for a celebratory meal. Our server made some clutch drink recommendations too. My favorite: the local martini, all made with locally-sourced ingredients and ridiculously good chevre-stuffed olives. Almost like a cocktail and small plate in one.After reading everyone else's reviews, I hope to come back here next for brunch.**to take Big Burrito up on this offer, join their mailing list decently before your birthday, and a voucher will come in the mail! It was a blissful discovery for a pair of graduate students.

"I'm a big fan of all the Big Burrito restaurants I've tried (Eleven, Umi, Mad Mex & Casbah). I think Eleven is my favorite, but Casbah is a very close second. My most recent trip was with my wife on 11510. We started with the grilled flat bread and the butternut squash ravioli. For entrees, I had the Casbah twice cut pork chop and my wife had a pasta dish with sausage and ricotta. For dessert, I had the creme brulee and my wife had the espresso ice cream  cookie (it was really just a fancy chipwich). The grilled flat bread came with three different dips, Humus, Red Pepper Hummus, and Baba Ganoush. I really enjoyed all three, but thought the Red Pepper Hummus stood out as the best, although if you're not a fan of garlic you may disagree. The butternut squash ravioli didn't impress me much, but my wife really liked it. As far as the entrees, we both really enjoyed our meals. My pork chop was cooked perfectly, and was anything but dry. The sage aioli that it was topped with added an excellent flavor. The sides were kale, and butternut squash risotto, both of which really shined. I can't describe how amazing the risotto was, and the kale was extremely flavorful. I tried my wife's pasta dish, and overall I thought it was good, but the sausage was really outstanding. Incredibly tender and flavorful. Neither of us were too impressed with our desserts. The creme brulee was very good, but at that point, I expected it to be great. My wife's dessert sort of disappointed, since the cookies were dry. The bill for everything listed above, plus a bottle of red wine (~$35) was $120 before tip, so it is pricey, but in my opinion totally worth it. Also, our server was very attentive and helpful, without being intrusive. I asked his opinion on the French Malbec and he gave me his honest opinion, which was negative.

"The food is pricey, but out of this world. Try their Beef Tenderloin ala Blue, topped with gorgonzola dolce and sweet onion marmalade, and served with pancetta and spring pea risotto. It melts in your mouth. My friend also enjoyed the Wild Boar - sounds crazy, but delicious.

"Quite a number of the best meals in my life came courtesy of the fantastic chef and extremely cordial waitstaff at Blue. Whether for birthdays, work meetings, or just a desire for a nice night out Blue never disappointed, and they often outperformed even themselves on many occasions.The staff here is without a doubt one of the best trained in the city, from the waiters to the hostess to the managers and owners, everyone treats you with a high level of respect, and makes you feel like you are the most important person in the restaurant when you're there. After a few visits I found one waiter I liked even more than the others, and I would always request his table when I came, with no problem from the scheduler. Don't forget, if you bring your own wine (which I do quite frequently) make sure to pour some for your waiter! Not that you NEED to bring wine to Blue, because they have a wine list that is second to none (well, maybe Bonterra) in Charlotte.It's hard to recommend specific dishes at Blue, because I've had so many fantastic ones and they change very frequently with the seasons. It's a Mediterranean style of cuisine, so expect heavily herbed flavors on whatever you get, and an emphasis on great sauces. Perhaps my favorite meal here was a whole shank of Osso Bucco, served over fava beans and mashed sweet potatoes, with a crab and lobster risotto on the side. Pure decadence. If you see this dish on the menu it is the one thing I would suggest getting over anything else, as the meat is so fall-off-the-bone delicious it is nearly impossible to surpass. The duo of bison cuts is another one I would highly recommend.The cheese selection at Blue is also top-notch. There are usually 15-20 to choose from, including several expensive bleu cheeses, which are fortunately all the same price here. It comes with honeycomb and pecans on the side, and unlike many other restaurants doesn't cost extra. Another one of my favorite elements about this restaurant is the very first thing you get when you sit down, hearty bread and the most wonderful spread I've ever tasted. It's a kalamata olive based butter that looks a bit funky at first, but once you eat your first piece the bowl gets quickly emptied.Be sure to save plenty of room for desert as well (Blue's dinner portions can be quite dramatically large) because they whip up some of the fanciest creations you can find in the Charlotte area. And for those of you that don't go for overly sweet temptations there is also a huge fresh berry desert with homemade ice cream, one of my favorites!

"The atmosphere and the service made my evening with friends so much more pleasant that I will definitely be back. The food was good, the Mediterranean salad was amazing, that dressing was tasty and not overbearing, the orange chicken was well cooked but not as special as I hoped for, then again, I can't expect miracles from chicken. The desert (tres leches) was great, super sweet so not for everyone but tasty.
",1
"I have been here twice, both times with a large group & we had a private room.  Service was excellent as was the food.  I always recommend this place to anyone visiting Charlotte & they always tell me how much they loved it.
",1
"I like Blue, not sure why I don't get here too often (the price may be a big weigher).Last time I was here is for a friend's birthday celebration. I ordered the sea bass and yum... I almost lick my plate if only my momma didn't teach me well. My companions got Moroccan chicken and some part of pig on a bone. Yes, they both are also yummy (I'm a forker and good at it!) But definitely glad I didn't lick my plate because then I had room for dessert. They were nice enough to put all three desserts (chocolate moose, lemon bar and chocolate molten cake) on a beautiful plate with candle on it. We unanimously agreed, we will claw each other for the lemon bar. Waitress was really nice and attentive. So... definitely come and visit blue, get some wine and lemon bar while listening to jazz.

"Great setting. Big restaurant but great service. Mediterranean. Halibut was killer - in a soup.  Major dipping action.  A gem!

"My wife and I goto Blue several times a year (mostly for special occasions and what not.)They've never put a foot wrong.The service is impeccable, the wine list is extensive, the martinis delicious, the food delectable.My absolute favorite has to be the summer seasonal Pork Milanese.  Had the Tenderloin last time and was suitably sated.
",1
"So I have eaten here a hand full of times and the food and service has always been out of this world. This is actually one of my favorite places to get fillet Mignon. Although, I have tried many other things on the menu though; like the wild boar - which will blow your mind. Regardless, I think you would be hard pressed to find bad food here. The only disappointment I have ever experienced with this place is that they serve Foie Gras. I am sure they make what is considered ""good foie gras"" but I just think it is cruel in terms of what they have to do to the poor duckgoose to make this dish. As far as the feel of the place, although it is upscale, I find it to be a bit more casual than formal. With low light and deep tranquil colors, it is relaxing; setting a good stage for conversation. Another great date place in my book!

"I've been to Blue twice to entertain clients for dinner and both times, the restaurant exceeded my expectations!  First, they are extremely accomodating to large groups and easy to make reservations with.  The staff is top notch with impeccable service and I was very pleased to see that they knew the extensive wine list and every detail of the menu to a tee, which should be a given at a restaurant of this caliber but I'm always surprised at how many places this doesn't hold true.  Onto the food, we started with the arancini (sp) balls - YUM, they are a must have and our table enjoyed the calamari and scallops as well.  For dinner, several people at our table had the Wild Boar (two ways), which I got to taste, and it was amazing, definitely one of the best things on the menu.  I opted for the Duck Bolognese the first time and was not disappointed; the sauce, pasta, duck and even the fried egg on top were all cooked perfectly with flavors that blended exceptionally well.  During my most recent visit, I had the Lamb Tagine, which was not only spectacular in presentation but also in flavor.  It's a hefty portioncooked over cous cous with fruits and veggies - it was so tender is just slid off the bone.  To finish, all the desserts were great and I highly recommend Blue for just about anything - a date, business dinner, special occasion or just a drink at the bar.  Enjoy!

"I took my husband to Blue last week to celebrate his birthday and we both loved it!  The waiter we had was very helpful and proceeded to give us a list of his favorite menu items as soon as we sat down.  His input deemed extremely useful since my husband loved the dish he recommended.We decided to order the cheese platter and were very pleased with it.  Although the cheese that the waiter described as ""stinky cheese"" was pretty mild, it was still pretty flavorful.  The lamb shank that I ordered was cooked perfectly. In fact, it was so perfect that the meat was falling off the bone!  As a disclaimer, I will start by saying that I don't eat pork (I know, I know) but the pork shoulder that my husband ordered was phenomenal!  The risotto that comes with the dish was also fantastic.  It was simple yet very flavorful.The only complaint that I have about this restaurant is its dessert.  We ordered the cake di chocolate and were terribly disappointed by it.  This chocolate cake just falls short.  If you decide to try a dessert at this restaurant, I would definitely recommend that you try something else (especially is you love chocolate).

"LOVED LOVED LOVE THIS PLACE!  It's kind of like a cafe style restaurant with a glass cheese display.  The owner is a humble Republican State Senator...after a few glasses of wine he probably gets cornered quite a bit.  Anyway...I was on a date.  This is a GREAT date place.  We ordered pairings of cheeses and wines that are already selected for you.  We each got our own tastes (3 each).  We shared each other's cheese and wine.  The service is so so, but nothing to complain about really.  After our cheese tasting I ordered the salmon.  It was cooked very well with fresh vegetables.Great place...and I look forward to my next visit in Phoenix to come back here.

"Out of all the wine bars I've been to in the Phoenix area (not counting Divine Wine in Mesa), this is my favorite! Hands down. The people are friendly, the room is spacious, the wine selection is supple & the atmosphere is cozy. The last time I went was after dinner at Panino on Central. My date and I went into the wine bar to sample a selection. He chose his with cheese. I did not. My wine was incredible. We were able to relax on the couch, continue our conversation while having amazing wine at our fingertips. I was giddy with pleasure. To top it off, the bathroom is unisex... and sneaky. Behind a wall without a handle, you almost have to tipsily stumble into it to find your way. While waiting for an open room (there are two private bathrooms once you're inside), a couple men profusely apologized. Evidently, they thought they were in the wrong bathroom. Little did they know. I would go back here in a heartbeat. In fact, I've been thinking of going soon - it's a perfect place for a date, since there's plenty of room to sit and an atmosphere conducive to conversation. Forget Kaz. Try Cheuvoront instead.

"Amazing food, great presentation and sleek space - with NO WAIT on a Saturday night!  Huh  Yes, you read that right.  After taking in the Body Worlds exhibit (What else does someone do after seeing dead bodies  Have dinner of course!) at the AZ Science Center we headed to Pizzeria Bianco and decided that we really didn't want to wait 3.5 hours (Phoenix's equivalent of Bridge and Tunnel were at PB in full effect) for food, especially when there are so many great restaurants within 1 mile.  So off to Cheuvront it was, and what a great dinner it was.Atmosphere - 5 starsFood - 4.75 starsService - 3.75 starsOverall - 4.5 starsThis is my third visit over the past few years, and each time it has been on a weekend night with a surprisingly sparse crowd.  I'm not sure why this is.  I've never heard anything bad about this place, so I suspect AZ State Senator Cheuvront's restaurant must be suffering from light rail construction.  Their loss should be your gain, as diners are rewarded with light crowds and superb food and wine.  Even one of my dining guests visiting from New York City was impressed.The sexy modern space on the first floor of the Artisan Lofts sets that perfect urban tone that the menu and locale indicate.  We sat at a table towards the back close to the loungey sofa area and curtained bar tables.  Cool touch.  We started out with a nice bottle of sauvignon blanc chilled in a fancy container and noshed on a French charcuterie plate of a pate mousse, cornichons (I have a weakness for salty gherkins), two cheeses, marinated artichokes, asparagus, kalamata olives, smooth spicy mustard and a crusty artisanal sourdough baguette.  What a great way to start a dinner, ehOur main entrees continued the pace and didn't disappoint.  I ordered the prosciutto wrapped grilled shrimp and macaroni and cheese.  Those thangs weren't shrimp.  These MOFOS were GIANT tiger prawns, and they were presented on a bed of mango avocado salsa drizzled with a balsamic reduction.  HEAVEN.  The macaroni was impressive as well - and cooked with three fancy cheeses: Quebec cheddar, comte and a dry jack cheese. Bonnie shared some of her ahi tuna salad nicoise - and that tuna was seared and seasoned perfectly, and surprisingly fresh.  Additionally I had a taste of the peppercorn filet and was pleased with the marinated tender taste of the meat.  Price for 3 people (apps, entrees and $40 bottle of wine) - $115.  Average entree - $16.  Not bad, methinks.My only complaint would be the service.  It was very good for the most part, but started to falter toward the end as our server's attentiveness (which was impressive most of the evening) left us with finished dinner plates on our table for about 15 minutes.  In his defense though, he gave us a very warm and classy (classy with a 'C') welcome and spoke very knowledgeably about the menu and wine when we had questions. Additionally, the hostess and other servers are super friendly and congenial. I'm eager for my next visit so I can try some of their martinis and buy cheeses from their retail section, but I would be just as happy enjoying a glass of wine there and soaking the place up.

"Sigh.  I'm in love.  If only I lived closer to Cheuvront.  Maybe I'll move downtown just to be closer....My husband and I went in on a Saturday night for a few glasses of wine.  Once we saw the desserts, however, we knew we had to try it!  I ordered the pumpkin bread pudding which was very good (it wasn't the Harvard Faculty Club, but then again...what is) and my husband selected the coconut pie.  Both servings were huge and covered in whipped cream.  They were fantastic.  Finally, a place to go for dessert here!We chose to sit at the bar and the bartender was amazing.  He offered us complimentary tastings of two delicious dessert wines and then even offered us a complimentary mini cheese sampler with an amazing sheep's milk cheese.  The atmosphere was perfect, it was laid back, kind of cafebistro-ish but still modern.  They were playing The Food Network which I absolutely loved...I've never seen that in a restaurant before! It was a great touch.   The wine list is extensive and reasonably priced.They have a wonderful wine dinner with four courses for only $55 a person!  I'm eager to attend one in the future and I definitely plan on going back for dinner in the near future.And that folks, was my 400th review. :)

"The search is over...I have found my favorite wine bar in the Valley! Comfortably situated on Central Avenue slightly south of McDowell, it's a quiet, chic space that I think will be tremendously helped out once light rail opens in a few months. The wine list is nice and covers a wide range of palattes. I've had the Kim Crawford Sauvignon Blanc before which was good, and also had a glass of another white whose name escapes me. The second white I had was poured for me by the very friendly bartender Jeff...I told him what kind of wine I liked and he hand-selected one for me to try. It's not on the ""wine by the glass"" menu, so he opened the bottle and poured me a glass. I love when places do that!  The beer list while small has all of my favorite imports, so thumbs up on that as well.The first time I dined at Cheuvront was for dinner and my friend and I started with the Brillat Savarin which was creamy and very much like brie...it was delicious. I loved how the server asked if we wanted more baguette when she saw we were running low because we still had a lot of cheese left.  I felt that the one cheese plate was a perfect size for two people to split as an appetizer. For dinner I had the caesar salad which was light and the perfect meal for a warm spring day.  I took a bite of my friend's Pizza Chevre which was really good and hearty.  I most recently dined at Cheuvront for lunch today with a group of friends. Our waiter was incredibly pleasant and even though the menu said they do not split checks, he was very nice about running two credit cards and breaking cash to make change.  Everyone at the table seemed very pleased by what they ordered. I had the macaroni and cheese which comes with a side salad. The mac and cheese was the perfect lunch sized portion and the salad was light and crispy.  Prices are very reasonable for both wine and food.Cheuvront is a great spot for lunch, dinner, or just to sit at the bar and try a new wine or two.  I know I will be there in the future especially with Kristin S. moving so close to it!

"As far as wine and cheese bars go - this place has Postino's beat by a long shot.  The wine list is impressive.  The staff can make recommendations on the fly.  The owner actually takes his staff to visit vinyards so they become familiar with the wines.  The food is out of this world - but unpretentious.   You don't have to travel to Scottsdale to get fine food and drink -- we've got it right here in Central Phoenix at Cheuvront.   With that said - try the Macaroni and Cheese - which is what I tried tonight - out of this world, albeit a little spicy.  I've eaten there three times and have yet to try a desert because I'm so stuffed from the fabulous cheese selection and wine.  My new favorite!

"Oh dear god, I'm in love...Peppered Filet and Martini Scallop dreams fill my mind. Blue Cheese stuffed olives in my martini what shut the fuck UP!! Sooooo amazing. Quality all the way. I had a glass of Byron Pinot Noir (fabulous) then a white chocolate martini for desert. (I prefer to drink my desert). Great romantic spot to bring a date. Secures that you will be getting action later, trust me. If you see me at Cheuvront stop by and say hello. I'll be the one in the corner making sweet love to the macaroni and cheese..... no joke.

"I take my wife here all the time.  It's a great date place.  The food is always good and the staff is always knowledgeable of the wines and paring them with foods.  We haven't had a bad glass or bottle yet.  My wife likes to order their Cherry Lemon Drop Martini and I have to admit I enjoy it too.The food is always prepared with care and I've always enjoyed a cheese plate or a Flight of wines with their recommended cheese pairings.I would like to extend my kudos to Barry.  He is the reason I kept returning as he has what it takes to take the front of the house experience to the next level.

"Cheuvront's is a gem.  Their wine selection is superb and their cheeses are tough to trump.  I have always been treated to wonderful service and taste treats.  I also love that they have such a wonderful champagne by the glass selection.  The Laurent-Perrier is by far the best and I love that they have it in splits.  Always something to look forward to when traveling to Phoenix.

Did i mention AMAZING chicken breast, yes i am actually raving about CHICKEN... granted chicken with lemon piccata, capers, arugula, and home made 'gnocchi' which were more like a pretzel bread than a gnocchi but none the less amazing.d. OH and pumpkin bread pudding... wow.. effing wow. Go for the page-long cheese menu and affordable yet varied wine selection.  I can not believe this place has been here for five years and i just now visited it. The Spanish plate, two cocktails, two glasses of wine, two entrees and a desert was only a bill... cant get that in LA.

"Having grown up in a city with a large traditional Italian neighborhood, full of large traditional Italian restaurants, the first thing I tried to find in Phoenix was a good plate of tortellini and a decent piece of Veal Genovese.  I found them at Christos.The atmosphere at Christos is very traditional... white tablecloth, stemware, cloth napkin and flower centerpieces.  It feels special when you come here for a meal, but the meal is very reasonably priced.The menu is traditional, with dishes like Pasta Primavera, Linguine with Clam Sauce, Chicken or Veal Saltimbucca, Canneloni, Chicken, eggplant or Veal Parmigiana.  They have Cioppino, decent salads and a good wine list.  What more could you ask for

"I have to say,I have been going to this ristorante for the past twenty years with my family.  Every time we go there we have the same server.  We are always greeted well and the alfredo is amazing, and so is the sea bass,  the halibut, and  veal chop.  The homemade house salad dressing is one of a kind too.  The new bar lounge area is nice and the pianist is a nice touch.  Love Christo's.

"It is not too often I am overly impressed. However, Christo's did just that yesterday when I had lunch there.My boss decided to take me and 2 of my coworkers to lunch for my birthday. He (my boss) really had some making up to do since last year he got me a 50 cent crappy brownie and put a candle in it and sang me happy birthday. He was definitely in the dog house. So I knew this year he was going to bring his A-game...hopefully. His choice is restaurants leaves a bit to be desired. Of course I did some research and Christo's appeared to be OK. So I felt a little at ease this time.I get there early and wait for my party. The hostess is very nice and she knows many of the people that are coming in as they are regulars. I have not seen anything like this since leaving home (NYC). Old world charm restaurants where they know you and you know them. I can't believe it. I grew up around very good Italian food. I have been to a few places here that Italians have recommended and it was just not up to par. Now mind you none of these Italians were east coast Italians. It is something to be said of Italian food on the East Cost.My party finally comes and we are seated. The place is very nice with the traditional white table cloths. Our server comes over and he is happy and attentive. He gets our drinks and comes back to take our appetizer order. We get the calamari of course. OMG the best I have ever had. It was lightly breaded and the marinara sauce was great. It was all I could do not to eat the whole thing. Our server comes back to tell us about the specials which btw were all fish dishes. I went with the red snapper, mussels, linguine with marinara and capers. Nobody ordered the same thing which is great cause that means we can share. The salads come out first and they are pretty basic. But the dressing was great. Ohh the bread was amazing. Jeez it is so hard to stop eating bread and butter. I was trying to save room for the rest of the meal. Our food comes out at the perfect time. Our fantastic server sets our plates out but before he gets to my co-workers plate this guy comes out and grabs his plate then brings it back in a matter of seconds. I thought wow the cook does not want stuff coming out the kitchen unless it is perfect. Come to find out it was Christo himself that came out to fix my co-workers dish. Looking around at the other plates I am thinking wow everything looks so amazing. The other thing is the portions were right on. I hate going to places and the have so much food it is ridiculous. The linguine was cooked perfectly. The server came over with extra cheese and of course a must have for me fresh cracked pepper. It was one of those times I did not want to share anything with anyone at the table. I did not want to disturb my palate from the wonderful flavors of my dish. I was thinking everyone else was thinking the same thing because no one was sharing. Well shortly after, every plate on that table was completely cleaned. The server was on point with filling our drinks. I never had a glass that was less than half full. Also I have waited tables and it is a fine line between being a pest and being helpful and friendly. Lets just say the servers at Christo's have this down perfectly. Well the plates are cleaned up and out comes this cute little cup of vanilla and chocolate mousse with a candle in it. Compliments of the kitchen since it is my b-day. Well is was great. I am not really into mousse because it is a texture thing but the flavor was awesome. I still got to order dessert. I got the flan, others had key lime pie and NY cheesecake. Ohh decisions a toss between cheese cake and flan. Well flan won. I practically licked the caramel sauce off the bottom of the plate. It was the best I have had here. Ohh NYC Christo's has brought a little of you back to me. Sniff Sniff tears of joy. I am so happy. I found a fantastic Italian restaurant.

"O.k. let me get it right out there. This fabulous local spot in the same strip center as my own business. But after years of eating here I am not sure why they fly so far under the radar with the ""foodie"" crowd. The service is top notch (and ya know I'm a picky girl about this). Some of the servers have been there since the place opened.It is family owned and operated and they insist on high quality ingredients. The prices are fair and the portions are large. I am a huge fish fan and these guys  deliver up some amazingly well prepared Mediterranean style fish dishes. They serve soup and salad with their entrees and the bread is worth the splurge.I enjoy their wine selection and this summer there is a great wine special Mondays through Thursdays. I invite all my foodie friends to give it a try!

"We went there for a family birthday and it was great.  I was the only male out of the 6 people in attendance and these women love to talk!  We were there an hour and half after closing talking and the staff was TOTALLY COOL.  I felt bad for staying so long but the staff kept telling us not to worry about it.Great food! Great service!

"I usually reserve five stars for places like Kai, but for the price, this restaurant deserves five stars.  This is an excellent restaurant, and that is definitely rare in Phoenix.  We enjoyed a nice bottle of wine while waiting for another couple to arrive, and we were never rushed or made to feel like we were a bother because we didn't order any food for the first 45 minutes.The sea bass special was some of the moistest fish I have ever eaten.  I am amazed at how they were able to cook such a thick cut perfectly--not one part was over- or under-done.  It was served on a bed of pasta and topped with a marinara sauce that was delicious.  The entire dining experience was very pleasant.  No complaints.

"Some friends turned me on to this restaurant years ago, and while I have since left AZ, they still live there, go to this restaurant, and still love the consistently GREAT food.  This was one of my favorite restaurants when I lived there.  They made perhaps the BEST cannelloni (melt-in-your-mouth deliciousness) and avgolemeno soup (only rival I've found is Taverna Tony in Malibu).  In fact, we had them cater my daughter's bat mitzvah reception......they were that good.  I'm just sad I haven't been able to enjoy their food since leaving AZ.  In addition to ALWAYS getting their cannelloni and avgolemeno soup, I used to get their Lemon Dill Salmon, Chicken Limone, Chicken Genovese, or Shrimp Scampi.  I know I'll be back to Phoenix one of these days, and when I do, this place will SURELY be on my list of ""to-do's.""

"Food and service was awesome, the best fish and soup, the included salad was very basic but good and fresh. For the price we paid my wife and I never had such good food. We both had the dover sole and it was great with perfect service. we both can't wait to return and try the other items

"Sophie B. has me very confused:  You can get a sandwich & a drink for like under $10 bucks  the Duck.All the sandwiches are handmade right in front of your very face -- any time a restaurant prepares the food where the whole wide world can watch them do it tells me they're proud of their work & their food.  And they should be -- it's great!  They even have each pickle wedge individually wrapped in foil -- take as many as you want (within reason).   :-)I've been a customer of the Duck since long before most of you moved to Phoenix.  Consistency -- nice people, excellent food, reasonable prices, wide selections of wines & soft drinks, seating indoors - outdoors - upstairs.  No worries - The Duck is always good.

"Duck and Decanter ""the Duck"" is freaking awesome!  I like the store like atmosphere and the friendly staff.  Aside from fabulous sandwiches and sides they have lots of other great stuff too.  They have unique dishes, gormet foods and sodas.  The Duck also have a large wine room and beer selection.  They can get busy during lunch, but the staff are very friendly, and quick!This is a great place to grab a handmade sandwitch and snoop threw the store while you wait!

"Went for the first time yesterday for lunch. It was soooo good! There is a wine  beer bar adjacent to the main retail  deli area. Lots of unique gifts,  artisanal cheeses and more! I was amused that they take your lunch order on a brown bag and put your lunch in it. Had an excellent roast beef sandwich and sat out front (note for summer: they only have outdoor seating). Clean, friendly and delicious, check it out!

"Best food ever no.  Value for price Through the roof.This is an awesome lunch stop for those on a budget and they happen to stock a respectable beer selection to boot.  Mmmm, Hacker-Pschorr Hefeweizen on tap.

"I love visiting D & D. This place is about the atmosphere as well as the food. On the weekdays the place is bustling with corporate America, moms meeting up and exchanging baby stories, a few networkers collaborating on a project and one or two snooty folks. It make up a wonderful array of folks having lunch. On the weekends there are families, dogs, children, babies, old folks, young folks sharing stories and sitting outside listening to the great performer chosen for that weekend. There are misters around the patio area.I love the nooks and crannies where you can sit inside or outside. The sandwiches are good. I love the turkey on dark rye with avocado. They are generous on all fronts. Yes the place is pricey! Drinks, sandwiches and chips can run almost $30 for two people! However you get a free small concert on the weekends. The kids run loose, the dogs bark and it is fun! The wait staff is incredibly friendly and several folks have been working there for years. This is not a place for those individuals looking for a fancy dancy sandwich. This is a place to have fun, relax and enjoy some good food and a great atmosphere!

"Duck and Decanter is one of those places where while eating your meal, you suddenly think, ""Wait. Am I still in Phoenix"" This place is SO unlike anything else in midtown Phoenix that going there for the atmosphere is half the pleasure. It's part sandwich shop, part eclectic boutique, part wine cellar, part loft. And some other things thrown in too. Tucked away in a corner of a generic strip mall the place looks like someone's house from the 70's. Hard to describe. Once you enter there is a counter where you place your order with a little salad case, a cheese case, and a dessert case. Once you get your sandwich (or salad), you can either sit outside on the patio or take the stairs up to the upper dining area. Or sit on the upper deck outside patio. And yeah, the sandwiches can get a bit pricey but like I said, half the fun of the place is the atmosphere. I've always enjoyed my sandwich. It's not like I'm paying for something I don't like. The breads and the 'fixin's' have always been fresh and full of flavor. Go get a sandwich, do a little browsing, relax, and take in some people watching. And if you can figure out what city the place reminds you of, please let me know. Cause it's not Phoenix, for sure.

"I love the Duck! My mom has taken me here for years growing up and I always loved their sammies and pickles. This last weekend a friend hosted a bridal shower for me on the patio and it was an amazing time.I didn't know you could reserve a private patio and it had the perfect mix of sun and shade. We had sammies and fruit salad catered and bought a few bottles of champagne. What else do you really need for a good timeWe ended up staying a little longer than our 3 hour reservation and never felt any pressure to hurry up or leave. We still heard the live music and got the energy of the other patrons while having our privacy.Food was tasty as always. Fresh veggies, hearty bread and I love that pine nuts are in the veggie. One of the best lunch spots ever!

"I really had no idea what I was getting myself into when I went to Duck and Decanter.  I'd seen the sign as I would drive south on the 51 and think ""I like duck, and I REALLY like wine. This place would be perfect for me!""  As it turns out, I wasn't quite wrong, but it was not at all what I expected.The Duck and Decanter is a strange blend of deli, gourmet food and kitchen wares store, as well as wine shop.  It all comes together in a fun and eclectic building set far back from the street and the rest of the shops in the area.  You definitely feel, as you enter the candlelit courtyard beneath an enormous old tree, that the world outside does get a little more muffled than it really should be.  Wandering bemusedly through the tiny shop behind the courtyard, I was really struck by how unique this place felt in Phoenix.  Care is obviously put into not only the choice of wares being sold here, but the quality of food presented to the customer.When I finally got around to the deli counter, I was about to order their specialty duck sandwich when I saw they had a reuben.  As I find it hard to turn down a reuben anywhere, I asked the woman behind the counter what she advised.  Without hesitation she said, ""The reuben.""  Just as I had hoped and I'm glad I listened.  The sandwich was excellent.  Perfectly proportioned and fresh as possible without going backwards in time.  Making a good sandwich really is an art and the workers here are masterful as their craft.Sitting outside at night with a wonderful sandwich in this strangely out of place shop is an opportunity not to be missed.  But take care to go there when you have some time to really savor the place.  Like the wine, there's much to enjoy here and it'd be a shame to miss any of it.

"The BK Army had a meetup with our leader the lad we follow and the listen to every weeknight at 9pm on Channel 3. Oh wait, this suppose to be about the food, not Beverly Kidd. But she's so cute.Ok to the food. Its been about about two years since I have been to the The Duck and I have to say I really need to come back sooner next time. My usual fare is a roast beef or corned beef sandwich, but this time I wen for the duck sandwich. I can't believe that I waited this long to try out the signature meal. You get to choose what you want, a variety of cheese is accompanied by different mustards, mayo and of course the tomatoes, lettuce, onions, and of course almost every type of bread. What is probably the most fascinating is the assembly process. There are always at least five people assembling the orders, three taking orders or getting the orders to the customer. You order at one end, wait around a but and pick up on the other end. On between there are cookies, sauces, coffee pots and almost anything one could want to have a yummy meal. Then there is the stuff for the home kitchen or counter. So to the review the duck sandwich was amazing, going to have it again. Got mine on a croissant with a bit of mayo and mustard. Only got a half, with a beer. There is a small pub style corner with a smaller choice of beers. This didn't damper the meal at all. The place is always hopigng seems like. Seating upstairs overlooks the lower area, and the outside always seems to have a couple of four legged companions that are sometimes as humorous as the owners. The little fellas seem to know exactly how much they can annoy their larger counterparts. This is one nice deli, sandwich shop and gathering of just plain great folks. Oh yeah and Beverly Kidd was great fun to be with and eat with.. she also seemed to like the Chocolate Surprise cake I got for her.... opppss was that suppose to be kept quite

"For some time, my idea of an absolutely perfect lunch was to go to vintage market, get a great salad, a plate of cheese and fruit and a bottle of wine.  On a great weather day, sitting outside and watching the people stroll by, there isn't much better.  Mind you, you can't do that often, but it's wonderful when you can.  It's the closest I've seen for feeling like you're sitting at a Paris market outside a busy street.  They have great sandwiches too.  And if you aren't in the mood for my ideal lunch fantasy, they can still help you pick out a great glass of wine to go with your sandwich before you run over to see a move at Esplanade.  Or, buy a whole bottle of wine to enjoy after the movie.  I've always been given great assistance in picking out the perfect bottle.  I can almost taste it now....

"I've been driving past Sophie's for 3 years now and finally took the opportunity to go for happy hour. On Friday night they have half price bar appetizers and my husband and I split 3 dishes and were blown away!We ordered the escargot, which was very tender and delicious and had a very authentic, rich flavour. The smoked salmon was perfect with the creme fresh sauce and toasted baguettes on the side. The most amazing dish we sampled was the Noisettes de boeuf, which is essentially small tender pieces of beef wrapped in very lean bacon in a Dijon mustard sauce. This was seriously the most amazing beef that I've ever had and I'm typically not a steak person. We ended up ordering a second helping of it since it was really that good!We finished off the night with a delectable Creme Brulee and it brought me back to my days living in France. It was the perfect ending to an incredible meal.The owner of the restaurant is extremely friendly and sat down at the bar to chat with us for a while. The bistro has a very warm and inviting atmosphere and the patio is beautiful at night. This place isn't snobby like a lot of French restaurants and the staff is very responsive.We ended up spending about $100 between the drinks and 4 appetizers (BTW - the Mango Martini is to die for!) but the whole experience was really worth it. Tuesday night is ladies night with half-price wine by the glass and I'll be back again soon for that.keywords: french food 85016, french cuisine, biltmore area french bistro, arcadia area french food

"Amazing!  From start to finish this place was incredible.  Great french host (Mgr).   Great french waiter, helpful and funny.

"Sophie's in one word  Perfect.I only go twice a year to celebrate the end of the fall and spring semesters.  Why  Because I don't want it too become familiar or stale.  Yes, it's expensive, but you get what you pay for and Sophie's doesn't disappoint.Dining is an experience.  You put on shined shoes and a tie and make reservations.  I like to go around 5:30 because it's usually not that busy.  The dining room is inviting, calming, welcoming.  You can have a conversation without having to raise your voice.  I always make it a point to try something way out of my comfort zone:Lobster Bisque -- the last thing I eat before I die! sweet breads (a.ka. brains) -- ethereal...gooey, runny cheese -- salty and tangypate (goose liver) -- creamy and so flavorfulThings I wouldnt' have eaten in a million years are some of the best things I have EVER eaten.  Sophie's just invites you to be daring.Do you wait for your food  Yes!  But that is the best part.  You can have a conversation with your date, you can relax.  They don't make you feel rushed so why should you take on the responsibility yourself  Just enjoy yourself.  The food is coming.So many places are so desperate to turn over tables that diners adopt the same mentality.  Gotta get my food fast, gotta eat it fast, gotta get out of here!  I love Sophie's because I can take the time to appreciate everything.  It is just so wonderful to find a place like that to look forward to every year.  It's worth the wait.

"Dottsy Z. and I met here last week to try their new happy hour and we had an amazing time! The weather was perfect, the patio beautiful, and the company was amazing.Their happy hour menu featured a nice variety of white and red wines, all for $6, plus we tried the escargot, pate, and frites as well. We spoke to chef, who was very knowledgeable and able to accommodate gluten free items, especially if you call a day or two in advance. We topped off the night with a decadent creme brulee and imported cocoa dusted truffles, which capped off the evening on a perfect note.

"The owner Serge was very French, but his head chef was not. I loved that their head chef came from another culture. He had fallen in love with French food. So much so, he had moved to France to study it there. The dishes he created were perfectly delicous. I remember his filet with crushed peppercorns; it was soft and buttery. The peppercorns gave a kick without being overpowering. The quail was delicate and succulent. The salad with lavender honey vinaigrette was perfection. His chocolate spice cake was phenomenal. It contained seven spices. I can't begin to describe the joy that cake brought to everyone. It was unique. It was at the time when chocolate souffles were at every French restaurant. Unfortunately, he's not there anymore. Regardless, my rating will remain until I have a chance to go back and say otherwise.

"Having lived in France for two years, I found this to be the most authentic food in Phoenix. They were very accommodating to special requests.

"I hate to admit it (because I usually avoid ultra trendy places like an ex boyfriend) but I love Postino.  It used to be an old post office, thus the name.  It is now a wine bar that serves ""light fare.""  There are not too many places with this kind of atmosphere in the Valley -- very California.  One of the walls is a giant garage door that they roll up so the whole place is open.  Little couches and coffee tables are mixed in with tables and high tops for a variety of seating choices.  The bathrooms are lovely, clean, and lit by candles.  The salads are my favorite in Phoenix and the bruschetta is out of this world.   Come early, get your table and enjoy!
",1
"I'd heard so much about Postino that I wasn't sure it would live up to the hype. Happily, it did! The atmosphere, the food, and the wine all measure up at Postino, the place that started the uber-urban renaissance at 40th and Campbell.Postino is upscale, but not pretentious. The bruschetta really is out of this world, but the salads are incredible, too. Went there for lunch on a Friday and loved the diversity of the crowd. I also liked it that the noise level was reasonable, even when the place was packed.

"One of my favorite places in Phoenix, that I don't frequent nearly enough.  Great selection of wines by the glass.  The atmosphere is sexy, industrial pseudo-warehouse, I-don't-think-I'm-in-Phoenix type lounge.  I think on Tuesdays they have a live DJ in the mix.  It's more of a wine bar than a restaurant and the menu reflects that - with the heaviest of items being their paninis.  The autostrada panini comes loaded with several meats (soppresatta and prosciutto among them) and cheeses and is amazing.UPDATE - Great service just recently.  A bit of a wait, but forgot about it because of the great servers - Michelle I think, was one of them.  Just had a Tobin syrah that was incredible...

"I love this place!  It's a fun place to sit and relax and sip a glass of vino.  Be sure to order the bruschetta...I especially love the figs and prosciutto.

"Located at the SW corner of 40th St. and Campbell.  This entire corner is now owned by an enterprising young couple who ingeniously converted the old post office to a wine bar featuring fresh aperitifs and lite gourmet pizza!  They did such a fab job on the remodel they were written up in Architects Digest some 8 years ago (or more) when they opened.  It's become something of a low key meeting hub with ""great date"" written all over the place.  Any given night of the week you will find this place a' buzz!  So plan on a wait, unless it's early in the evening or very early in the week - like Monday.  Open for lunch and open late; again with some candied confections that could make a girl on a diet cry.  Look cute, because this is where the beautiful people hang out in Phoenix, sans attitude.  Moderately priced.

"I love this place!  I just recently moved to San Francisco from Arizona, but I already made sure to visit it on my first trip back.  I have never brought someone there and had them not like it. The atmosphere is great - small and cozy, and very warmly decorated for a former post office.  The wine list is comprehensive for both the white and red wine enthusiasts, and the servers are willing to make recommendations off of the list from their cellar.   Service is typically good unless they are super busy (Friday and Saturday).In addition to the wine choices, the bruschetta is awesome!  My favorite is the red pepper goat cheese, but I've also heard very good things about the proscuittomascarponefig one.  You order a sampler of four different types at a time - and there is a pretty even mix of vegetarian and meat options.The only problem is that location is less than desirable for people in the SE Valley - it is a far drive from Chandler or Gilbert to the Arcadia neighborhood in Phoenix.  Here's a tip though: when you get there, don't wait for someone to leave or pay for the valet parking in the crowded lot, there is plenty of parking available for free in the side streets nearby.

"I totally heart this place. The food is great - for a wine bar. You can actually eat dinner, and leave not feeling like you filled up on cheese and olives the whole time. Plus the wait staff is great.  You will have to wait on a SaturdayFriday night - but who is in a  rush then anyway It reminds me of a neighborhood place in San Fran...a must-go in Phoenix.

"Also on my sweltering trip to Phoenix I visited this place.  My good friend's brother is one of the bartenders (Sam) so we had to check it out. Sat at the bar for a late afternoon lunch.  Started off with a glass of champagne just because I was on vacation and I could :)   We also had some champagne mixers they were making specially that day that were really nice.I had some trouble deciding what to eat since the menu all looks so tasty but i went with the bruchetta.  I mean, come on, you get to choose 4 toppings, how could I not!  I even had a hard time choosing only 4!  I had the apple with brie and fig spread (my favorite), roasted red pepper with goat cheese (very good), prosciutto with figs and marscapone (wow) and salami with pesto (great).  All of this for $12 and HUGE!  Four heaping pieces of bread cut into four pieces each.  My friend also got the roasted artichoke one which was just as delicious.  Three glasses of champagne and more bruschetta than I could possibly eat I was extremely satisfied.  I've been actually thinking lately...where can I get this delicious food in LA

"Love it love it love it.Whether you're looking for a fantastic bottle to take home or you want to munch on cheese and crackers while you drink and converse, My Wine Cellar has you covered.  The retail portion of the restaurant is really excellent, the walls lined with a huge selection of reds and whites.  If you're intimidated by the selection or are a beginning wino, the restaurant offers ""wine education"" courses.  My fiance and I attended a weekly ""Wine 101"" course a couple of years back.  Each week, we sampled a different genre of wine including reds, whites, dessert wines, and champagnes.  Also, each week included a guest speaker, usually a sales rep for a wine maker.  Lots of fun and I learned a huge amount of information!

"Gotta love Lucy's! And I do! Great selection of wines, yummy snacks and ""bar pies"" - really, where else can you go for a $100 wine and pizza I say that a bit sarcastically - as I always get a bit ahead of myself and pick out a great wine because really, life is to short to drink bad wine!  My husband rolls his eyes when I suggest Lucy's cause I am not a cheap date there, but he likes it too. He even threw a surprise bday party for me there, recently - and it was all perfect. The back patio is super when the weather is nice, and they have cozy couches inside, or a table if you prefer. Check it out, it's fun!

"has an awesome relaxed feeling when entering, seating on comfy couches and chairs, very clean-has lucille ball stuff all round fall tree and very cute decor- that did it- oh and the wine too!!!   bruschetta (traditional) is perfect w drink ..loved it

"If you like wine and awesome food - you MUST try My Wine Cellar. They have an awesome selection of vino, and an amazing menu. To boot, the staff and owners are wonderful people and make it a delight to come here. My food favorites on the menu are the pizzas, a culinary masterpiece! And my favorite wine is the ONEHOPE Chardonnay - not only is it inexpensive and delish - but 50% of profits are donated to Breast Cancer charities.Bottom line, amazing and affordable food + yummy wine + great people = A good time! :-)

"Love MWC!!! Went for an after dinner drink for my sisters birthday. We were greeted by the owner with a friendly smile. Katie was our server. She was very knowledgeable. I told her I wanted a Cab, and she brought me a lil piece of heaven. My sisters and I shared the cheese platter and it was more than enough for the 3 of us. The entire staff was super friendly. I will be returning to MWC for sure, whether it's for date nite or girls nite I can't wait to go back!! Thanks again Katie you were amazing!!!

"Um, pretty much the perfect place for date night... First dates, thousandth dates, last date, whatever. Amazing patio, great music(cheers to whoever auditions these people or trusts their mixed tape), great wine selection, and awesome food! I love their bruschetta's . The service is speedy and low key, you don't have to worry about someone hovering, but when you need that next glass, they are there with a suggestion. Professional and knowledgeable. The owners are great. I think every time I have been there(a lot) one of them has stopped by to say hi and make sure everything was great. I know this place has just transferred ownership, and MAN they are doing everything right. It was good when I first started going, and now it is GREAT! Totally recommend to anyone looking to take a date to a classy place that is reasonably priced, where you can make it a long night if things are going well, and a short night if she sucks.

"From the ambiance, to the staff, to the wine list, this place has got it figured out.  I LOVE wine, but I usually feel like I'm being tested when I go into wine bars.  This place is so unpretentious, it's a breath of fresh air.  If you don't know exactly what to ask for, the staff will ask you about what you've liked in the past, what flavor profiles you prefer, and a ton of other questions to narrow down exactly what you'll like.  3 times out of 3 they've nailed it on the head!They just recently added a happy hour menu and expanded their food menu as well...you have to try the smoked salmon bruschetta best I've had in the valley (even beats out postino's smoked salmon!)To top it off, this place even offers wine 101 classes, grape varietal classes, and even a book club!  I think you get it by now: This place rules.

"Bumping this place up to five stars since I have been here a couple more times and both times it was a great night.  This place has an awesome vibe to it, great food and wine, and good service.The pizza is very tasty and filling. The bruschetta options are all amazing. I also tried the antipasto plate and was happy to see it came with a little salad that helped to balance out the saltiness of the meats. The cheese and olives that it came with were a great accompaniment to the wine we were drinking that night. This place is awesome because their bottle prices are extremely reasonable in price and they have some diverse options. The comfy couches and relaxed atmosphere make it a great place to just hang out with friends for hours.  The staff is super friendly and knowledgeable and they are great at recommending new wines.  I asked about a wine that I had once but haven't been able to find anywhere else and they actually ordered a case of it for me!  Just a really great place.

"I love coming here for an after work drink in a relaxing environment. They have a decent wine selection with a nice happy hour menu offering some really tasty treats. I love the bruschetta, particularly the brie, apple and caramelized onions - delicious!The staff has always been incredibly friendly and attentive. I sit on the patio almost every time and love it. They have lights strung across the patio and it gives a great ambiance in the evening. I've been on a Saturday night before and they had live entertainment - just a guy and his guitar - and it was the perfect touch to the already amazing atmosphere.I also attended a networking event here for women in my industry and they handled it perfectly. The staff was spot on, offered perfect little bites and made it a very enjoyable event.I really like how laid back and relaxed the environment is and am so happy it's so close to work that I can make it a regular spot to unwind.

"I have My friend Tigearnan to thank for first introducing me to Pesto's.  Who knew it even existed with it's unassuming stripmall facade.   I was pleasantly surprised to meet Antonio, a superb bartender who makes you feel as if he invited you to his house for dinner and cocktails with 40 or so of his closest friends.  He mixes a mean martini and helps you make the best drink and eat choices to fit your mood.The lighting is right, the food fresh and tasty and the staff bring it all together for a delightful evening of socializing and or just eating.  I'm crazy for their house Pesto Pizza and  fabulous Greek Salad.  All this for a great price.It's a jewel in the East Valley you have to check it out.

"I remember when this place was nothing more than a hole in the wall :) I went here a couple of months ago and WOW! What a change! The food is still delicious as ever, but they have really upgraded the place and it is a really nice restaraunt now. A great place to go for a first date.

"I only got to this place once while I was in Arizona and really intended to go back--maybe next trip!.  They had really wonderful spaghetti with white clam sauce, an item I often try but rarely find as good as my home place in California--San Fillipo's in La Mesa.  My daughter got the calzones, which she had had here before and knew they were good.  I had a taste and while that is an item I never order, they were delicious!  The atmosphere here was very nice also and I was really glad we had chosen it.  It's one I wouldn't hesitate to recommend to others.

"Ok my first review wasnt the best but since they've remodeled the place, i love it!Great neighborhood spot to go for a drink and a bite to eat. Their cheese plate appetizer is delicious and the pesto pizza is my favorite.

"Pesto's - where have you been all my life!!!  It was my pick Saturday night for dinner, only to find out my hubby had been for lunch a couple years ago.  Boy, was he surprised!  Who knew such a cute winepizzapasta place was inside  The decor is gorgeous - and I loved the beaded curtain and high top tables!  As for food - I had the BEST Calzone (the Pesto) I've ever had!  It wasn't too cheesy and the sauce on top was perfect.  We also loved Pesto's take on the caprese, with greens added.  There were lots of options for wine too.    The hubby tried the pepperoni pizza and said it was ""okay"", but he's picky when it comes to pizza.Granted, we did go early but there were too many kids for my liking.  If you're looking for a more ""adult"" environment, I'd suggest sitting in the bar area.  As we were leaving, they were setting up some live music.  We'll definitely be back!!

"After going to see Eat, Pray, Love, of course there was nothing I was craving more than authentic Italian food!!! I've been here before for lunch and dinner, so Pestos was the first place that popped into my head. This place apparently has been around for YEARS and I'm not surprised-their food is amazing! I ended up getting take-out rather than braving the bar solo (there's also a separate dining area) and ordered the linguini with white clam sauce (it was to die for!), mozzarella sticks with marinara, olives (not a huge fan of the sesame bread that comes with it), and OF COURSE a cannoli for dessert! The linguini was perfectly done and the clam sauce was amazing with just the right amount of clams. The mozzarella sticks were so-so, nothing special about them that I was thinking I should have gotten the stuffed mushrooms instead...these I KNOW are worth it...oh well, next time. The olives (an appetizer) were a delightful blend of 4 or so different types and it definitely hit the spot-I love olives!! They come with sesame bread, which I'm not really a fan of but I was craving carbs so I smothered some butter on it and was over it pretty fast. Now, I have NEVER had a cannoli as delicious as the ones I've gotten from Pesto's! Ever. These are absolutely melt-in-your-mouth amazing! From the chocolate chips inside to the crushed pistaccios outside sprinkled with a little powdered sugar and a fresh, crispy shell, your mouth will thank you!! Everyone that works here is absolutely amazing! It's a family business and their pride of ownership shows in everything they do. I've NEVER had bad service here and even when they're over-run with the high schoolers (note to self: don't go during Seton's lunch hour), their service has always been top-notch! I highly recommend checking them out-even if it is just for an amazing cannoli! =)

"I don't get out to Chandler much. But a friend's bridal shower ended up being held here. From the food to the service, everything could not have gone smoother. I heard they had recently remodeled the place. Well...bravo! Everything is tastefully decorated. Looks like a great place to get your happy hour on. There was a beaded curtain that sort of separates the bar area from the dining area. But it's a metallic bead curtain so not at all hippie-like. I can't believe a place like this is inside a strip mall with a Safeway.The theme of the shower was wine and cocktails. The bartender--the owner's daughter--was super hospitable and personable. For our party, she demonstrated how to make four different cocktails. And the owner even went to the trouble of printing out the cocktail recipes on specially decorated paper. The owner is a lovely woman with a lovely personality. The owner is actually good friend's with the bride's mom. So, I don't know if the restaurant would do that for any party. But judging by how nice she was, I'm sure they would do something if asked and offered reasonable payment. And everyone was raving about the cocktails which were truly very good. My favorite was a chocolate martini. The bartender was skilled at taste as well as presentation. For the food, we had a yummy cheese plate which included a parmesan cheese with honey for dipping, a truffle flavored cheese and another cheese that came with a pesto dip. We also had some scrumptious stuffed mushrooms. And for pizza, we went with the pesto and Mediterranean (sun dried tomatoes, chicken and feta cheese). The pizzas were thin crust and piping hot. And the cheese in my opinion was melted to the right consistency. It took all my power not to shove down more pieces when not everybody had gotten some yet. I was happy with the food and level of service. I would definitely recommend to anyone. I only wished I lived closer so I could visit Pesto's on a week day.

"A most unexpected gem! If you are a wine drinker, fabulous flights! Great selection! I can't say much more other than... AWESOME!

"What a pleasant surprise this place was!  Great wine list, terrific food and a totally awesome contemporary decor. The ambiance and lighting were perfect, and the space created a very relaxed, modern vibe, which was not at all what I was expecting from the outside. It's in a strip mall in a Fry's lot and looks from the outside like an average mom and pop pizza joint, but it's totally chic and cool inside!!  My husband and I are pretty picky about our italian food and we liked everything that we ordered. I especially liked the eggplant parmesan sub I had, it was one of the best I've ever had. The wine flights are really great, you can choose 4 of your own picks or go with one of their themes. The pours are generous, you get what equals at least 2 full glasses when you order a flight. We will definitely be going back!

"I was in town for a quick trip and needed a place to grab a late dinner.  From the Yelp description I only knew it was a pizza place with good reviews - I didn't realize the atmosphere was so chill and modern.  Pesto's is not just a little hole in the wall with white walls and pizza sauce stains by the floorboards.  Instead, it's a very nice spot to take a date, or to just belly up to the bar solo (as I did).Service was friendly and fast, and a good selection of alcohol (especially liquor) is on hand.Great atmosphere, friendly service, and delicious calzone. Drenched in sauce and absolutely delicious.

"My mother is a member here and she wanted to come for a family dinner over the holidays.  They have completely remodeled this country club which was long overdue and it is so gorgeous now.   It is hard to put into words the transformation this place has undergone.  It does not look anything like it used to except for maybe the golf course and the parking lot.  Our server was young and was probably used to going through the motions of serving tables, but we were there to enjoy ourselves and have drinks and conversation... when we clued him into our intentions he was fine with that and very accommodating.  There was one minor incident where he spilled my cosmopolitan on my sisters fiance, but he handled it like a champ:).  We actually felt really bad for him because we know that is a servers worst nightmare... he was lucky that he did that to our table and not another club member... somehow i don't think they would have been as nice as we were.  Our food was very good and our server was a great guy too!  We had a great time at the Arizona Country Club.

"This place is a really off the wall Vegas experience, an authentic German gasthaus just off Las Vegas Blvd.  Full bar and great beer on tap - at great prices.  The club is private, but you are allowed a limited number of visits without joining.  There is usually a dinner on Saturday nights (check the website for details).  The quality of the meals prepared by the members is good, and again the pricing is reasonable.  Non-members can enjoy a meal also.  Just call the club by Thursday to make a reservation.  Absolutely one of my favorite places to have a beer in Las Vegas.  Surreal atmosphere, warm and friendly people (almost none of them are German ;))) and delicious German beer on tap!The Club itself (known as the GASCON)  is pretty neat too.  They have a couple boozy golf tournaments a year, which are a lot of fun, and also do a fantastic job hosting the Oktoberfest in DT Las Vegas.  Annual membership is like $35.  I carry my card in my wallet.  The GASCON is making a push to increase the headcount of its younger members (hold your national socialist youth movement jokes please ;))).  There's talk of using the space on the off nights as a music venue and also of hosting viewing parties for both the US and Germany games at the 2014 World Cup.  I'll be there...

"This club is great, fun nights, good bar, good food. They are open Tuesday for Jazz Night, Friday for card night, Saturday dinner and dancing and one Sunday a week for Fruschoppen or Brunch.  Please check out the website of GASCON if you need info.

"After years of driving by this place at not going in (it is a club*), we finally had the chance during a Rummage Sale. Oh my God, it is cute inside! I know a German Restaurant in town that could use the charm of this place!!!!It has a full bar (with German beer -of course!) and kitchen (kitchen is usually only used for their Tuesday Night Vintage Vegas Jazz evenings, Saturday Dinners and the once a month Sunday brunch.  They said the Club is also available for Special Event rentals. Most of the members are above the age of 50 (but I was told they have been getting a small influx of younger members recently).  Best to check their website for hours of operation, But they are open Tuesday evenings for Jazz,  (sometimes) on Thursday evenings, Friday and Saturday afternoon and evenings and the once a month Sunday brunch.  The bar prices are cheap! It is an all ages club, so you can bring your children there (just not in the bar section).  This is a ""Private Club"", but they said guests can come Three times to experience it before signing up. Oh the dues... if you do want to join, it costs $3 a month !!! ($35 the first year), and $2 a month for following years ($25 for renewal years). What a bargain!  Yes, I ended signing my wife and I up we love it so much!

"The Leatherneck Club is totally cool. My boy Mo turned me on to this place, as he and his Vet buddies from Operation Desert Storm used to go there and swap tales with the oldtimers. It is practically a museum to the USMC, with all sorts of insignia, signage, pictures and even war souvenirs like captured kalishnikov rifles, grenades, and flags from WWII and Vietnam. Plus, after drinking there and staggering out into the night, you feel like you are in Singapore or Hanoi, what with the neon lights, asian signage and massage parlors everywhere. If you are a marine, you are to REPORT THERE IMMEDIATELY OR DROP AND GIVE ME TWENTY. Hoo -Ra!

"Oh My God.  Where do I begin.  It was love at first sight.  At once when I first started frequenting the place, I honestly was a little leery of dining there.  My buddy told me to order the Pepper Burger ! Holy Hell !!!!!! Freaking Amazing.  The food there is to die for.  Ill be across town & drive over for TACO TUES or a Green Chili burger.  The drinks are fabulous & everyone is so friendly.All the military memorabilia is really cool & the bunker out back is sweet ! Thank you for your service & the great chow !

"If you are a Marine and you come to Las Vegas you owe it to yourself to stop in and check out the Leatherneck Club.  It is a BarGrill that is part Museum part Marine Corps Party House.  Beer is super cheap at about $2.00 for domestics and the food is priced as well.  One of the best burgers I have had in Vegas.

"I belong to a Marine Corps League detachment and one of the old timers told me about this joint. What better place to put a Marine bar than smack dab in the middle of Chinatown and right next to an Asian massage parlor no less I can neither confirm nor deny that the massages at the aforementioned establishment have a happy ending, but I can tell you that if you are a Marine or a devil doc, checking out this place IS A MUST! If you are the child or grandchild of a Marine or devil doc, or even a new girlfriend of one, bringing your vet here during your next Vegas trip IS A MUST.They didn't lie when they said they have some of the coldest beer in town. They carry both import and domestic, but sadly no Dos XX's. No drink is over $5 and they pour pretty strong. They also have a few beers on tap to include a hefenweizen. Deb was our bartender and her husband Spider cooks in the galley, and they have lunch specials and Friday night dinners too. From what I hear, Spider cooks a mean meal and even does catering for the events that go on at their hall, which is available to rent for special events.They are home to the Marine Corps Riders motorcycle club as well. inside their hall, they have memorabilia from WWI all the way up to OIFOEF ranging from uniforms to campaign commemorative K-bars and even enemy articles as well. I am sure they'd take any kind of donations if you have them to add to their museum. I noticed they didn't have much air wing stuff so I donated my squadron patch (HMH-465) to them. If you want gear to take home, they have a small PX and sell challenge coins and T-shirts from their MCL detachment and a few basic USMC veterans covers too.The last bit of info I can pass on is that its a little hard to find cause its in the middle of the Arville Shoppingtown Square ant can't easily be seen from the street. Just look for the big yellow MASSAGE sign with red lettering on the right hand side. You can't miss it!  And you won't want to either! Its just like being in an E-club on base and I'd imagine just like the SNCO or O clubs too. They have a few regulars there and a retired colonel whose a member there made us feel right at home from the moment we walked in the doo and even bought me and my compadre, also a Marine a couple of shots. If you are reading this Col. Czech (Tom), thanks for your hospitality!  Like the say, Once a Marine Always a Marine! Semper Fi!

"The music scene in Charlotte can be a little sparse.  I imagine a lot of acts just don't want to roll through the Queen City for whatever reason.  Thank goodness for the Neighborhood Theater, then, not only for being a great venue for a fan, but for being the type of venue that I think a lot of bands would really enjoy playing.The main performance space is airy and well ventilated, especially when they've got that monster ceiling fan running.  Where did they find that thing  On the Death StarI also like that they've got seating in addition to the standing-only floor space.  I sat through three bands in a row a few weeks ago, comfy as I could be in my padded seat.  Might make me sound geriatric, but I appreciated taking a load off.I was all the more comfortable as a result of the excellent beer selection at the concession.  They've got a top notch bunch of brews, including Sierra Nevada, Bell's, and Sweetwater.  Nice job on that.To top it all, the acoustics are great, and it's pretty conveniently located.Neighborhood theater is the type of place Charlotte cannot afford to be without, and I'm looking forward to many more shows there.

"One of my top two favorite places to watch live music  in Charlotte (Double Door Inn is my other)!  Located in NoDa this place has a great sound system with no bad seat in the house.  Go when the doors open to reserve a seat, then go grab a cocktail and explore NoDa (The Dog Bar and Cabo Fish Taco are two other favorites in the area)!  Prefer to stand!  Plenty of room for that up front so you can be up close and personal...and dance!  Neighborhood Theatre also upgraded their bar area- now serving all kinds of beers, licquor, etc.  Cheers...see you at a show!

"Recently attended the Neighborhood Theatre. wants to say CONGRATULATIONS to the The Latin American Coalition - Charlotte, NC for selling out the event and it being only their 2nd year doing the event! The vendors were great, the people were fully participative and everyone had a great time. BCBS, USAirways, Cricket, etc had great giveaways! I'll be back next year! The Venue was a pretty good size, nice size music hall for concerts, plays, and festivals, Check out their production line up and see for yourself. I'm sure you all will be pleased. I was and will definitely be back for more fun!

"I must reiterate what an amazing place this is and how it is absolutely a staple not only to the NoDa area, but the entire live music seen in Charlotte.  I apologize for my quick review before but most of my write ups are about food, so I was just straight to the point.Sooooo, much history here, and more to be made.  Many bluegrass legends such as Doc Waston, Del McCourey, and Acoustic Syndicate.  Other genre's such as Little Feet, Rusted Root, and even members of Crosby, Sills, and Nash have graced these doors.  Too many too mention.   There are many free shows quite often and its one of the biggest venues where you can still feel that intimate vibe from your favorite artists, IMO.  1000ish capacity I'd say.FIRST OF ALL:Don't park in their parking lot unless your in a hurry, there are plenty of free spots up and down the sidestreets of the area.As soon as you walk up and see the marque, you know the place is legit.  Once you walk in the can see the side stage if open and a bar to your left, always filled with friendly faces.  There are plenty of good beers on tap($4 for a stone IPA being my favorite) at this cash only bar.For most larger shows, this side stage I speak of, is rarely noticed and the dance floor for it is open for you to watch the main stage in the next room over.  That is where the fun is.  There is normally a dance floor open up front with seating behind it, but when ""softer"", more singer songwriter type shows happen they pull out the seats for all.  Another option is the balcony upstairs(which is full of seats), is normally a great place to be, because many that don't know the theater well don't know about it, although it can get a little hot up there.  The VIP section may be worth it to you as having a waitress is nice, but you'll pay a little more for the ticket.The place is nice, but the talent they pull is amazing, rarely if ever have I heard anything not at least listenable, and except for a couple free acts everything I've seen there has sounded great.  This place normally has something going on all the time, and coincides with the gallery crawls too.  This is a piece of Charlotte that has to be witnessed, read the calendar, if you don't see anything you recognize, read some reviews of the bands, I have a feeling there is something there for almost everybody.  At least go buy and check out the free arts market when it happens.Hope to see ya there, I'll probably be the guy with a beer in his hand standing front row.

"Great place to see any show!  Large venue, they use curtains to section it off for smaller shows but the place is huge.  In the main stage area there is the biggest fan I've ever seen, possibly bigger than most helicopter blades, and it churns out hurricane like wind that will literally blow you off your feet.  There is a huge mushroom statue right inside the entrance that appropriately makes you feel like you are falling down the rabbit hole.... which side of the mushroom did you eat They have $3 PBRs on draft which is a nice deal.  The bathrooms are by no means high-class but they do have awesome, high-tech, eco-friendly hand dryers that remind me the old school operation game, don't hit the side or you lose.  Ps- they sell earplugs here if you forget to bring your own!  but if you value your hearing I would recommend having a pair stashed in your back pocket.

"This place is dramatically better inside since they fixed it up. The once dinky bar counter is now a full on bar with plenty of seating and selection. Various types or art adorns the wall, though it's a little dark to fully appreciate some of it. The lighting is appropriate for everything else though.They didn't really change the stage area. There is still a giant stage with tons of space in front of it and plenty of dancing and sitting room. There is one new thing in the stage room. You can access a section of the bar now, which is awesome.The is one let down. I'm not sure if they are fixing it up or it's just been closed but you can no longer get up on the balcony, which used to be one of my favorite places to relax. Hopefully they have it open again. But all and all, I love what they did with the place.

The patrons and bartenders were super friendly and made us East Coasters feel welcome. I would recommend both young and old visiting this post. The drinks are cheap and there is gambling!

"The security of this community always takes great care of us. 247 patrolling our streets. The actual community center is located right next to the school. That's how you know even our kids are safe. And when you need help, they come right away! This entire neighborhood is peaceful and the people here are friendly. I love that there are trails that run in-between and all through out this neighborhood. and there's long roads instead of street patches. That way when the day comes for me to finally wake up early enough, I can actually jog. If I'd want to live anywhere in Summerlin, it would be right here in this neighborhood.

"I have been a student of the True Buddha School most of my life. The School is global, with the main headquarters in Redmond, Washington. I recently moved to Charlotte and was so pleased there was a temple here. The people here are some of the nicest I've met! The services are all mostly conducted in Chinese and the attendees are also mostly Chinese, so it can be very disconcerting for non-Chinese speakers. Don't be intimidated! Culturally, there are differences, but everyone is good people! :) On a day-to-day basis, the English is limited, but we definitely have quite a few English speakers dotted within. If you have questions or want to learn more, please feel free to call or stop by and try and make an appointment with an English speaker. We are usually there on Sundays. Regular weekly service (usually group cultivation + meditation) is from 11-1. You can feel free to come by and observe, and we can try and answer any questions you have before or afterwards. And you would be more than welcome to stay for lunch.There are also a number of books and brochures available that have been translated to English. Printed words only get you so far. The best thing to do is to track down an English-speaker and ask everything you've ever wanted to ask. There are no stupid questions, only ""teachers"" who may not know the best answer. :)Currently and at least through the end of the year (2014), we have a dharma class being taught in English from 1:30 to 3. It gets into some of the nitty gritty of Buddhism, so if you are a beginner, I'd recommend talking to someone before jumping into class. Either way, anyone and everyone is welcome.TBS is open to everyone, Chinese or not, and of any religious background!Our spiritual leader is Living Buddha Lian Sheng. Our dharma and our practice encompasses all Buddhist schools of Mahayana, Hinayana, and mostly Vajrayana. While other temples and societies may practice differently, we all believe in the same basic precepts of the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path.

"If you have a interest in Buddhism and don't know anyone who is Buddhist or just want to experience this first hand. This is the most welcoming group of people you will ever meet. They are willing to explain the Buddhist practice to you one on one or within a group. There are meetings that take place throughout the valley so if this is to far to go to call them they will help you get teamed up with someone in your neighborhood which is nice. They also have a website that explains the practice as well but I must say you have to experience this first hand. Hearing the discussion and interacting with someone first hand is the best way to truly understand this practice.
",1
"This is the most welcoming and diverse religious group I've found in Las Vegas.  I use the term ""religious"" loosely because many, including myself would argue that Buddhism is more of a philosophy for life and well being.  Much of Buddhism does not fall under the general ""religion"" rules.  No prosthelytizing, no supernatural beliefs or dogma and no belief in a ""heaven and hell"" or all-knowing higher power.The SGI-USA Buddhist Center focuses on a particular brand of Buddhism known as Soka-Gakkai, which is the most established and followed form of Buddhism in the United States.  I was told that the President of the global organization donated some of his personal money to cover much of the costs of construction because he felt the Las Vegas area was a crucial place to have a presence.I went to the community center a few months back to check it all out.  Luckily I got to see one of the monthly valley-wide meetings that everyone attends.  You're likely to hear a lot of chanting, perhaps a video from an SGI presidential address in Japan, and lots of people talking about how Buddhism has improved their lives.  What struck me most is the diversity.  You'll find people from all ages, races, and walks of life.  No formal dress code.  Just come as you are.There are plenty of volunteers who are there to explain SGI Buddhism  to newcomers.  Much of the day-to-day and weekly experiences involve attending smaller meetings with people in your neighborhood, often hosted at a member's home.  I haven't been back much since I'm still exploring other forms of Buddhism.  But those who are interested will find this as an excellent starting point.

"Being out here from Denver for a bit i Decided to check out the Vegas Chapter. Well first the doors were locked :( I walk around and run into Larry. Hes in the back pulling weeds. AWESOME. We introduce ourselves and he opens the doors for me. I tell him im from the Denver chapter and he welcomes me with open arms. Immediately i felt like ive been attending this one forever. Its been open about a Year and a half. It was built with the environment in mind and is very green. The Bookstore was closed but i peered in and although this one is smaller it still has a lot of space. They used it well. They have a office for your use, and a Main Room to chant, and a over flow room. Then 2 other rooms that double as conference rooms and have smaller gohonzon's in them as well. We talked for a while and gave me some names of the people whos district ill be in. And he wondered back outside to finish landscaping while i chanted for a bit. I said my Goodbyes and went about my way until Sunday. I even found out the history about how this Buddhist center was built and will be the basis for new SGI centers.

"Very beautiful and nice temple. It is small but good for practicing buddhism. I like it here. It is affiliated with Fo Guan Shan. I like it here. I came here for the first time when I visited Vegas and I was looking for a buddhist temple. I ended up joining their Sunday service and I actually had a very good time. I am buddhist regardless what the world is. I like Buddhism so this is my faith and religion. I believe Jesus is a buddha or a boddhistiva or a ruler of one of the thirty three heaven. He can't be the one that Satan GOD send to earth to teach people good things. I know some buddhist believe it but I remember my original buddhist teaching and also why would Doctor Sun Yat Sun believe in Jesus.

"I was amazingly surprised to see my childhood monk's monastery on yelp.I grew up being raised Buddhist, so I went to numerous monasteries in the Las Vegas area. This is by far the best Buddhist temple in Las Vegas. The decor is beautiful inside and it is very spacious so you aren't crammed next to each other when you meditate. Arjahn Chaiya, the lead monk is extremely helpful when you want to learn about the Buddhist religion; he does not come off strong like most religious practitioners, which is a big plus. He is very respectful of other religions and beliefs.Although I do not practice Buddhism any more, I still come to pay my respects to Arjahn Chaiya, but I also come for the monthly food fair that is popularly reviewed on yelp. Some of the food is good, but not spectacular; however, the items that are there every month that are AMAZING are the Moo Yahng (Pork Skewers) and Guay Tiew Nam (Rice Noodle Soup). All in all, its a nice, spacious, and beautiful monastery to practice Buddhism and it is a delicious cultural find!

"""Do good and be good; not to do any evil, to cultivate good, to purify one's mind- this is the teaching of the Buddhas."" -CMM websiteChaiya Meditation Monastery hosts a monthly food fair that many attend for the inexpensive, tasty Thai food, with proceeds going towards paying the monastery's mortgage.  I've been to the food fair several times, but never really looked around the monastery grounds until this month.  Visitors are welcome to cross the colorful bridge and explore the outdoor meditation area that is obviously well-tended to by the monks and nuns who reside at the monastery.  At the time I walked through, it was only myself and one of the monks was there, doing a little gardening.  It's not a very large area, but it does have several beautiful Buddhist statues, a pavilion, a golden tower, and sidewalks that visitors can walk along to see this intimate place of worship.  According to the website, the monastery offers daily meditation classes that are open to the public, one from 9:00am-10:00am and another from 5:00-6:00pm.  For more info, go to www.chaiyacmm.org.I'm definitely not an expert on Buddhism, but from what I've seen of the monastery, it's obvious that the goal of providing a tranquil space for meditation and some peace for those of any religion (or no religion at all) has been met by Chaiya.

"I cannot say enough wonderful things about Kinesphere, and owner Dominika. She recently lead a private class for my monthly women's group, kindly opening the studio late to us and allowing our group to bring in refreshments.Upon walking in the door to see a welcome note to my group on their lobby chalkboard, we immediately left the outside world behind us. The studio is gorgeous, clean, comfortable and peaceful. Dominika instructed us on ""relax and release"" techniques, expertly demonstrating the use of foam rollers and other equipment for stress relieving stretches.Dominika welcomed our questions during the demonstration and easily managed to correct and assist the entire group that evening so that we each had a great (and valuable) experience. I have gotten great feedback from all of our attendees on our visit.

I will definitely be returning to Kinesphere and highly recommend it.

"This place is like a little Italian grocery and a prepared foods shop.  They have the best fresh pasta (I love how it takes like 2 minutes to cook)- they have a bunch of different kinds of ravioli, spaghetti, and other classic Italian dishes.  If you want to try something a little different the sweet potato ravioli is awesome!  I also highly reccomend their sauces and breads.  This place also has a pretty decent wine selction.  This is the perfect to stop and pick-up something that you can prepare at home in minutes.

"Taste the difference with the fresh pasta from this place!Yes,. you can buy ""fresh"" pasta in the grocery store, but don't. IT ain't so fresh.The lobster and crab ravioli was outstanding when combined with my own recipe for vodka sauce, i added shrimp and viola my guests were impressed. I love it because although I enjoy cooking,ravioli is last on my list to whip up in the kitchen.I've also purchased the cavatelli in the past and was fantastic along with my simple broccoli and garlic sauce.based on the taste and freshness of the  Pasta I give five stars , skip the chicken dishes in IMO.Also love the wine selection.Oh and they have Cannolis!

"This place is amazing. I lived in Rome Italy for 6 months and this is as close as it comes in Charlotte. They have make to order fresh pasta that is fabulous. Great rosemary focaccia, over 15 different types of ravioli, lots of Italian wine and groceries as well. Yum!

"Is the amazing array of Italian imported oils, pastas, cheeses, wines, canned and jarred veggies and such more expensive than your average high-end grocery store Yeah.Does it cost more to buy their made-in-house spaghettini or ravioli than HT's failed attempts Of course.But who cares. Everyone that works here is awesome, you can taste almost anything in the cold case before purchasing, open kitchen in the back so you can watch, if you tire of shopping...it's an impressive little store that deserves the extra buck or two. Or three. Hell, maybe even four.Lately (for you meaters) they've branched out and have started stocking Grateful Grower's sausage and some other hard-to-find NC fine meats, as well as their standard Italian selection.There's also a fridge with sauces, pastas, etc in the PM Common Market, if you don't feel like making the drive down Providence, and the parking kinda sucks... but go at least once.

"Pasta & Provisions is amazing!  You really should go there, now.  Right now.  Everything from the homemade pasta, ready to eat salads and grilled veggies, the sauces, the meatballs, the wine selection and the focaccia.  It's pretty hard not to get wrapped up into buying every item they sell.  It's all so fresh and local, it's like a dream!  And let me tell you a little something about the focaccia.  On a recent trip to Asheville my uncle asked if I could pick him up two rounds of focaccia.  He said, ""they just don't make focaccia like that up here.""  You know it's good when you're taking out of town requests.  The entire entity is where it's at!  Owner, Tommy George has really created a family atmosphere in this authentic shop.  I always walk away, with a pep in my step, feeling great about supporting this local business and of course, hungry.

"*Advanced apologies for this being so long! :)""Sono nell'amore"" - I'm in love!  I wanted to burst into a child-like conniption right on the floor because I couldn't buy one (or more) of everything...someone hold me.  But I digress!  This is a FANTASTIC little shop - a lotta stuff packed in a small space & it seems to be quite popular.  Parking was a smidge daunting, but there is more in the back...but be careful since the tiny ally only allows for one car & you might get in the ""I'm trying to leave but no I'M trying to come in"" face-off!  The rear lot is shared with Providence Sundries & was pretty full when I was there around 12:30ish on a Thursday.Found the staff to be SUPER helpful, friendly & knowledgeable, especially as to which sauce would pair well with what pasta (all homemade in house btw)- one girl (didn't catch her name) offered to show me around the store & explain things when she learned it was my first time in, which was a huge help (although the shop is relatively small it's still kind of overwhelming at first).  Once the tour was over I wandered about on my own to soak it all in.  The atmosphere is easy with music playing in the background at juuust the right volume and a view to the kitchen in the back.  One cool thing they do is whenever someone orders any of their fresh pasta, they send it sailing from the kitchen to the register up front down a long wire attached to a clip (watch your head!) - FUN!   PS - you choose how you want your pasta cut: Angel Hair, Spaghetti, Linguine or Fettuccine.They have a huge menu board up front that spells out exactly what's in each pasta, ravioli and sauce, so you know just what you're getting.  Plus you see how NATURAL everything is.I walked away with THE most delicious Greek White Bean Spread & loaf of Rosemary Focaccia bread (which I am munching on as we speak)...just marvelous.  Also picked up a pound of fresh garlicrosemary pasta cut fettuccini style (only 2 mins to cook!), house-made alfredo and pomodoro sauces, and a pound of shrimp ravioli (prebagged).  They even gave me a treat just bc it was my first time there - how awesome is THAT!   They're my new bestest friends :)For those SIX, local, house-made items, my total came to $30 and change.   Taking into account I was supporting a local business and getting true FRESH items, made BY those locals, I don't think that was half bad.  One other thing I like about P&P is that their prices are fixed & do not fluctuate as they see fit any given day like many other places of this type, and from what I could gather (didn't ask, so..) everything is always available - they even give you a ""menu"" when you check out.  This is especially handy if you're trying to plan for a special dinner or get-together.  True, you are gonna pay more than you would at the grocery store, and at times quite a bit more, but it really IS worth it (especially for many of the ""provisions"").  Once we've munched on the pastas & sauces I'll update this.  But as of this moment in time I'm drooling over my newfound love.  Everyone should visit P&P at least once, especially if you love to cook, play in the kitchen, or even just browse & get ideas for a simple meal for two since they're more they happy to help.  OH...and they have very reasonable hours, including Saturday AND Sunday!!!  See you there :)

We had the garlic and rosemary linguini with their homemade pomodoro and marinara sauce (mix 1 part pomodoro, 2 parts marinara). It was incredible! We also had meatballs which I highly recommend. For $20, we fed 5 hungry runners! You only have to boil the fresh pasta for 60-90 seconds so it was really fast too.They have these little chocolates on a shelf called ""liquid coffee"" for $.75 that I got on a whim-SO amazing and now I have to find out where else I could find them!

"I am on run of local reviews here and I want to end it on my all time favorite food: pasta.  I discovered this local gem at the Phoenix Farmer's Market about a month ago and have enjoyed it ever since.  I love to cook pasta dishes and have been known to try my hand at making pasta with varying degrees of success.  Well, these guys make me look pathetic.  Their pasta is dried and cooks up in a scant 2-4 minutes.  The variety of flavors is outrageous: spinach, mushroom, garlic, roasted tomato, and so on.  These pastas are what I would call stand-alones.  You literally need to add nothing to eat for consumption.  Maybe some nice local olive oil ( mad props to Queen Creek Olive Mill! ) and some shavings of parm and you are golden...I would almost chug the remaining pasta water if it wasn't so damn hot!  Love the pasta  and love the fact that it's local people!  Go local!!!!

"I bought some of their pasta last weekend and am in love! I am hooked on the basil spinach, just a little salt and pepper and good olive oil. So good! I highly recommend them.

"So much for my commitment to consume fewer carbs.  I think this pasta could single-handedly kill the already dying Atkins industry.  I first tried Decio pasta at an event at the Botanical Gardens, and was happy to find them again at Old Town Farmers Market.  This pasta is air-dried and cooks in half the time of ordinary dried pasta, and it's unbelievably flavorful.  With varieties from Artichoke hearts to Wild Mushroom, you can get your veggies out of the way.  Well, not really, but it's as close as I get most days.  The first time I tried a sample, I asked what was in it and couldn't believe it was only a little of the cooking water and a tablespoon or two of butter.  While the directions (which I never bothered to read) do recommend you rinse this pasta, I never did and never needed to.  But I did find I should have done so with the lemon pepper.  I'm not sure why this was so much starchier than my favored spinach, basil, and garlic, but it was definitely too sticky.At  $6 a package (4 for $20 at the markets), this is one of the best inexpensive meals you can find that doesn't end in ""berto.""  And who can't boil water

Handmade, vegetable purees, and clearly a local favorite. I got a package of the Garlic & Chive Fettuccine as a gift for myself and was on my way. After a full day of traveling back to the east coast, it was midnight and I couldn't wait another day to try the pasta. It EXCEEDED expectations- amazing flavor, texture, and you can tell in one bite the high quality of this pasta- delicious! Obviously pricier than a box you can grab at the grocery store, but why waste the calories I have to order online to get my fix- but it is well worth the time and money. Lucky find!

"Found this gem at roadrunner park farmers market, I'm hooked!! I stay away from pastas because I only love it when slathered with heavy pasta sauce but I indulged in the mushroom linguini and WOW that was the best pasta dish I have made at home! Olive oil and pasta and it's bursting with flavor, so simple and so tasty. I bought the habanero flavor as well and I can't wait to try that one next!! I don't think I'll ever buy any other pasta.

"This store is first-rate.  These people really know their stuff, and you can tell that they are passionate about wine and beer making, and that they truly believe in their products.  I could spend an hour in here just looking...and looking.

"These guys are great. My husband loves to homebrew, and we always go here to get supplies. The employees are always friendly and knowledgeable. I also love that we can go in, say, ""Hey, we want to make a beer that tastes like (whatever brand)"" and they usually have a recipe for a similar tasting beer or can at least point us in the right direction.Bonus points to the employee with the massive beard (which my husband is envious of)- thanks for letting us know about how quick of a walk it is to Four Peaks from Brewers Connection. Made for a fun afternoon of shopping for beer supplies and then getting a quick celebratory pint. :)

"If you have no clue about homebrewing, homebrew supplies, or any of the terminology DO NOT HESITATE to come in.  Jeffrey Haines is highly knowledgeable, friendly, and has got myself and many of my comrades started in the art of brewing beer.  They have a large collection of partial (or all grain) mash recipes that you can buy as a kit with good directions.  Check their facebook page for the sale of the month (usually about $30 for a 5 gallon recipe). The only negative's which aren't worth taking a star off for are the directions are in paragraph form (probably to fit on a single page) and the website is AWFUL!

"Excellent selection of yeasts, malts and hops and all kinds of random cleaners, enzymes, additives and other stuff that I have no idea what it is. If it's for making beer or wine, they have it. Only encountered one time when they didn't have a Lacto strain I wanted and they ordered it for me and called me when it was in. Prices seem pretty standard for homebrew shops. They don't skimp on ingredient quality just for a little bit lower price, and they aren't ripping anyone off either.Bring in (or email them) your own grain bill or come in and tell them what kind of beers you like and they will help you out, or you can just take a look through their recipe books. I made their Pumpkin Porter last year and everyone I know liked it more than Four Peaks'.They always answer any questions I have, are always friendly and don't even mind me tasting a few grains of different malts to see the flavor difference between them.Highly recommend. Like getting homebrew supplies (that you have to pay for) from a friend.

"Fantastic brewing supply store, the staff is incredibly helpful and friendly. I'm an amateur first time brewer and i had a really positive experience each time I've been there, very helpful with all the questions i've had. Wonderful resource for all your brewing needs!

"Best brewer supply shop in Phoenix. Staff is helpful and knowledgeable with all aspects of brewing. They even do brew outs on the weekend with ASH that are pretty cool. This place is great for everyone from never brewed before and just interested to pros.I go here quite often to use their recipes or my own for brewing. If I ever have a question or just want some input on something, they never let me down. Can't say enough about what they do and how they do it.

"Marijuana legalization may be slowly coming to America these days but in 1979 another green herb started becoming popular (yes, hops) when the signing of Bill 1377, by Jimmy Carter, made brewing beer at home a legal versus an illicit affair and since then, interest in brewing one's own beer has only grown (I have no explanation for the surging popularity of owning chickens but that is a whole different issue). Well, if you live in Tempe, and want to start making your own beer, rather than paying $9 plus  tax for a local micro-brewed six-pack, then this is the place you need to go! You can get yourself a starter home brewing kit, make your first batch (first born pale ale, delicious) and then let your addiction to the use of the already legal and increasingly popular herb, hops, just keep growing as you improve the quality of your supplies and start making an increasingly varied array of beers to consume on your own or even better, start sharing with your friends. The store has a big book of possible recipes and you just pick one out, they give you a copy and will quickly put together the supplies you need to make the next magical batch of home brew. Currently I've got the Hammered Rye Pale Ale and a local recipe Hefeweizen (Dry Heat Wheat) happily fermenting away in my own humble abode. By the way, if you have questions, ask away, the folks who work in the store also brew  their own beer and if you join the local Arizona Society of Home Brewers you'll see those some folks attending the monthly meeting of that group, tasting a multitude of locally brewed beers by your fellow home brewers, right along with you. Hey, they might even raise their own chickens as well, you never know!

"I cannot support this store enough.  Sure you might be able to get your kit and ingredients cheaper through another website, but you will NOT get the 1 on 1 guidance and direction that comes by visiting these fellas.  They are incredibly friendly, and always have a good recipe on hand to suggest or recommend.  You can get everything you need for brewing beer or wine here, including specific and special ingredients that you might want to experiment with.  I will always recommend them and support this beautiful local business.  The only suggestion I would add is that they offer labels for the DIY brewer... luckily I've got a guy!  If you are even considering home brewing, come here and chat with them, they are excellent!!
",1
"This place is great. My husband and I started brewing a few years ago and have never gone anywhere else. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. It's a great place for beginners and people that have brewed for a while. They offer kits and great recipes shared by those more inventive!
",1
"I've been a regular customer of this place a few years now, and really love coming here. They have an excellent selection for the relatively small floor space -- the liquid yeast selection alone is impressive, and it's rare that I ask for a hop variety they don't carry. The staff has always been helpful and friendly to me, and very knowledgeable as well. I also really like being able to email in an order ahead of time.Prices are a little higher here than online, but with shipping factored in, it's pretty close for most items. Plus, if it's only a few bucks more, I'd rather put the money into the local economy and get my stuff immediately.

"One stop home brew shopping for the TempeEast Valley area.  These guys have been in the business for over 20 years and can answer any questions you might have.  A great selection of equipment, as well as plenty of recipes and ingredients on hand, make this the only place you need to go for your home brewing needs.

"I drink coffee like it's my job. Columbia Street Roastery is definitely the place to go to buy coffee or espresso beans. Not to mention, SUPPORT LOCAL BUSINESS! They carry a variety of flavors, decaf  caf, blends ...and there are quite a few choices when it comes to Fair Trade or Organic.  Looking for something to do on a Saturday They offer tours of the plant. And complimentary tastes!   During the summer months, they have a booth setup at the Lincoln Square Mall's Farmers Market too.

"I think it's amazing that Champaign has its own coffee roasters.  I think it's TOTALLY OMFG CRAZYAWESOME that said coffee is actually really, really delicious.  And reasonably priced (helloooo, under $11pound).  And you can get great blends or beautiful single-origin.  Or a multitude of flavored coffees.  Or tea.  Or various coffeetea accessories.  AND: If you buy 10 1lb bags of coffee, you get the 11th free.  What kind of wonderfulness is that
",1
"I admit, I'm fairly new to the serious coffee game, but most anyone can tell the good stuff from the bad...and, man, does Columbia Street roast some delicious coffee! I can't speak to any of the flavored coffees since I've stuck to their single-origin and organic, fair-trade coffee blends (yeah, yeah...I'm one of THOSE people), but what I've had has been absolutely delicious. The staff is always friendly and eager to help you find exactly what you need.If you're a regular, don't forget to ask for a coffee punch card. Buy 10 half-pound (or one-pound) bags and get a bag free. Free coffee YES, PLEASE.Oh, I almost forgot! They have lots of tea, as well. Immediately to your right when you enter the store. I haven't sampled any of them, but it looked like they have a nice selection.

"Local, tasty, helpful. What more could I ask for Dropped in on a busy Saturday. Things were frantic, but the employees were still helpful. No need to buy grocery store or out of town coffee again.
",1
"Wow, did it smell fantastic in there!  And the owner is pretty much the nicest, most helpful man in town.  After having one of their blends at Escobar's (next door, delicious), my family and I were looking in the window, bummed that they were closed on a Sunday, but thinking the shop looked cute.  The owner happened to walk by, and let us in for what amounted to a private tour!  He is one of those people that seems to know what you like more than you do -- he was asking us to describe things that we enjoy drinking  eating, and he helped us to select the coffee (and tea in my mom's case) that would best suit us.  He was very generous with both his time and coffee, spending time to discuss the various production methods, and their effects on taste.  I learned a lot!
",1
"Update: I have since tasted two more of Columbia Street Roastery's coffees -- the Guatemala HueHueTenango and the Mocha Java Bold blend.  I preferred the Guatemalan coffee -- nutty, with berry and chocolate notes [at least that is what I detected!], but both coffees are so good that my french press is getting a lot of action these days!
",1
"I came here for a coffee cupping with a small group.  The staff spent over an hour with us, taking us through the roastery and going through how coffee is made.  The cupping was fascinating, and we really learned how to properly taste good coffee.  The Guatemalan coffee that they served was incredible.
",1
"We live in the area and popped in one afternoon since we had a gift card. The owner asked if we'd ever been before and gave us a tour and recommendations. He was very friendly and knowledgeable and the coffee was delicious! (We buy whole bean and grind the coffee ourselves.)We've gone back several times to purchase pounds of coffee as gifts for friends and family. Terrific local business!
",1
"I have not purchased coffee anywhere else by Colombia St. in years.  It is simply the best. I love to go in and talk to the staff. They are know their coffee and are happy to tell you about it. They also make great recommendations. I've tried many different varieties. My favorite is the Dominican Gold (single bean) and I also like the Black Velvet ( a blend ). You can't go wrong here. I used to grind my own coffee but I found that when you ask them to grind it for a French press, the grind is more even and consistent than my poor grinder.  Also, they give you a punch card and after you buy 10 pounds of coffee, you get one free, so don't forget to ask for one! I don't drink tea, but they have a bunch of it! Probably worth checking out if you're a tea fan.
",1
"Excellent coffee selection, knowledgable and friendly staff.  It's just plain tasty coffee roasted right.  This is strictly a roastery so there's no on-site coffee or espresso, but if you can try a cupping, they're awesome and you'll learn a lot while you have some fun.

"When I began my search for the perfect home brewing kit I checked countless websites and message boards on what to get and how much money to spend on the ideal home brewing kit.  After a month or so of research I had a pretty good idea of what to get in order to make the perfect batch of sh*t face sauce.  When I got there I realized all my careful weeks of research and  planning had been in vein.  The dude that was there, who I think was the owner, was more than helpful on explaining every bit of the home brewing process along with some of the science behind it.  He informed me that a lot of the things being sold in some of the home brewing kit were unnecessary, which in the end saved me money.So I've been successfully home brewing and even when I ran into a little stuck fermentation problem I walked into Vegas Home brew and quickly got an answer and some yeast activator on the house to fix my problem.  They have a great supply of grains and extracts as well as a full refrigerator of different yeasts.  I plan on going back any day now to start another batch of brew. I encourage every body to visit Vegas Homebrew and start brewing their own beer.  Not only is it fun, it will get ya drunk.
",1
"I know a lot of beer drinkers out there that have never considered brewing their own beer.  I guess it isn't a hobby for everyone, but I have recently discovered the awesomeness that is brewing your own beer!  Vegas Homebrew has been an incredible help to me as someone who has just brewed his first batch of beer.  The only place in town, this place is ran by two friendly fellows and experienced home brewers.  They'll talk to you all day about brewing beer, and will help you purchase only the things that you need to start. Soon, I will be a good Yelper and get some photos of this little store for you folks to see.  He's got grains, hops, extract kits for new brewers, kegs, a huge fridge full of yeasts, and tons of other equipment.  So far, I picked up a 5 gallon plastic fermenting bucket, an extract kit, and a few odds and ends like sanitizer and extra airlocks. The total bill for my equipment and ingredients for my first batch was well under $90.  I encourage everyone who is into good beer to look into homebrewing, and if you do, start out at Vegas Homebrew.  Brewing beer is fun, and it really isn't hard at all.  I can't wait to try my first batch of IPA!

"I just got into home brewing, and I've been to the only two stores in town. Vegas homebrew is the store to go to. Steve was very helpful and informative, he knows his beer. He has very good prices, and will set you up to make any beer you like.

"Holy god does this guy know his stuff...We went in for a few supplies to brew our own beer for the first time ever and was amazed at the supplies and knowledge we got. The owner is a real down to earth dude that knows his stuff. He is the authority in town on how to,when to and what to do.Once our first batch is done fermenting and such, we'll go back and try different hops varieties and yeast strains!Such a cool place, support your local stores!
",1
"This place is awesome.Why:Steve the owner, one man band, gave complete attention to myself and whoever he was talking to on the phone. I had asked somewhere like a billion plus one questions and Steve happily answered everything in thorough explanation. For example  I'm sure Steve is constantly bombarded everyday by people asking ""I wanna start, but I don't know what to do"" and although he probably has told the procedure more times than you've heard the word beer; never hesitate to explain to this newbie. What:There are several home brew kits available for Wine and Beer, and all the supplies you'll need are here. You can go with the simple syrup homebrew to more advance kits like a Hazelnut Brown Ale from Rogue or he has all the grains, malts, hops and etc you'll need to make your own or imitate your favorite. The prices are really fair, compared to the internet prices, it was only a mere few dollars in difference. SHOP LOCAL!
",1
"This shop is an amazing resource and you can't discuss it without mentioning it's proprietor. Steve is encyclopedic in his knowledge of all things brewing related and is absurdly helpful. Between his ownership of the place and the worth of his expertise he could be a world class asshole and still get regular business, and yet he is one of the nicest hardest working guys you'll find anywhere, and super helpful. He kinda stepped up my brewing when he suggested I move from kits to working with clone beers which is actually a great intermediate step when you think about it.Another odd trick is that somehow despite being a fairly small retail space everything you need is here. If you required kingsfoil for a mythical beer you were brewing in fairyland he would likely have it drying in the back. I'd shop here if it were overpriced just to pick the proprietor's brain, but it's actually really solid prices. Plus no shipping fees. There's nowhere else that need be mentioned.Fair warning: It can get really busy in here and there's only one dude working, so if you want a fair amount of assistance with something go mid-day during the week. Also not open Mondays.Go for the reasonably priced equipment; keep going for the expert advice when you screw something up.

"Knowledgeable and friendly employees made my first brewing experience an outstanding one.  When the first beer was done, we only wanted to make more!  They we very open to beginners and answered all of our questions...even when we called up while brewing at home!  My wife even commented on how helpful and welcoming they were.  Highly recommend home brewing and this store in particular.

"Friendly and knowledgeable help. Wish this place was closer to us.

"This place is great. Like all the other reviews you must mention Steve. Honest, nice, approachable, and incredibly helpful. I used to buy a lot of my stuff online thinking I was getting a better deal (some cases it was true). However in reality I started doing a comparison. With shipping costs (we can't get everything off of Amazon), wait time, quality, and the ease of accessibility. You're actually better off going here. The cost is comparable if not better here. ALSO did I mention Steve and his RAD factor!! Seriously, you're supporting a local business which, if you live here you know how important that is AND you get the benefit of objective knowledge and information about cool beer and wine events. This is a great resource for a guy who is passionate about what he does and he deserves our support.Also I want to note, the selection of inventory is very decent as well. His inventory is always changing and fresh. Nothing seems to sit on the shelves for too long. Steve has never tried to up sell me on anything and always provides me with insightful options to improve my beer.

"We went here armed only with knowledge of a one time home brew done with a Mr.Beer kit. The shop is small, at the very end of a strip mall. We entered and was immediately greeted by the owner. We had tons of questions and he answered them in detail and was incredibly knowledgeable. We purchased a starter home brewing kit and he actually had a list he made himself of steps to home brewing and gave us his name and number in case we had any questions about the process. He was also incredibly cheerful. It's nice to run into great customer service and expertise in one place.
",1
"Pure awesome.  The owner brews gluten free beer on his own as well, so he gave me a quick rundown of how to do it... guided me right thru.  The prices are great, and he states he will hold your own brews at his location if you need a good stable temperature for fermentation up until it is bottled.He also carries many micro brews to sell... individual cooled beers and also the multipacks.  BTW... he tends to carry Dogfish Head quite a bit... he even had some of the 120 Minute IPA which is hard to come by.

"What a great place to go for Homebrew Supplies. The store is spotlessly clean, very well organized and well laid out. The staff there is very friendly and knowledgeable about homebrewing just about anything. Also you do not feel intimidated if you lack certain knowledge about the brewing process, because they are there to help. They have about everything you need for all your brewing needs, and at a very reasonable price. I will surly return to BYOB for my homebrew needs.

"Moved here from California.  I was so sad to leave my LHBS but was pleasantly surprised with BYOB.  Helpful staff and solid inventory of ingredients.  Some of their prices are higher than other online retail shops but not by much.  For me, I don't mind throwing a couple bucks to a local business.

"Needed supplies for a home brew and I work in Mesa. I thought I was going to have to drive all the way into Tempe and get stuff from ""those other guys."" I completely forgot about a small little store in a business park I remember seeing EVERY DAY when I drive to work (like an idiot). Much to my surprise, these guys were awesome. I may have been the only guy in the store but they gave me superb service, advice and showed me around a little bit. The store was very clean and organized, with almost everything in stock. I will continue to make this my only LHBS and recommend them to all.
",1
"This is my first (liberally given) 5-star rating. A clean, organized, stocked store. The crew will help you choose any style they have capacity to brew, and if they are out of a pre-made kit, they will assemble it in a hurry. Sure, you can mill your own grains but having Jacob do it while I wait is satisfactory, in the sense that I know they are willing to help without hesitation. *unlike service i have gotten from the 'other' place.they have a little basket of toys so the kids are kept occupied while i shop. a nice touch, and if you have toddlers you'll ""get it"". this store is worthy of a visit, even if you live in Tempe. a gem, i'll be returning here time and again. - mike s.

"I stumbled upon this place by accident one day while running errands, and I'm damn glad that I did.  Not only is it a closer homebrew store than that outfit in Tempe, but it's far and away a better store.  It's very open and clean, and they've got all the supplies and equipment that you'll ever need.  The staff is great, offering up great advice and even putting on brewing classes from time to time.  Their grain room is something to behold as well.

"Great customer service, great selection for my beer brewing needs, and reasonable prices. I am so happy to have this place within a few miles of my house. Everyone I've dealt with has been incredibly helpful, knowledgeable, and not snobbish or pretentious. The place is also clean and well organized. My brewing activity has increased since finding this place because it's such a pleasure to go get supplies.You might be able to get slightly better prices by shopping online, but then you're dealing with shipping and waiting and worrying about heat in transit... And there's less opportunity to learn something new or ask questions about the product you're buying. Besides, supporting the local economy trumps a few percentage points in overall savings.

"Once you to to all grain brewing, this is the store where you need to go as they have a walk in grain room and you can taste the grain you are using in your all-grain brewing. In addition, the staff is extremely courteous and helpful. I've received some great tips from them on improving my brewing. Just a first class operation!

"I just attended my first yoga class at McLeod Wellness Center. It was NOT easy to find! A little more instruction or ""clues' of what to watch for when I called to make my appointment to sign up (ex: Turn when you see building NO. 6240, OUR building is in the BACK, not visible from the street.) would have been most helpful as I almost turned around after going up and down the street for 15 minutes...I almost missed this wonderful place!! Karen taught the class and it  was such a wonderful, unexpected surprise! She was so kind, and really knew her ""stuff"". Upon walking in, I was offered a wonderful Chai Tea (iced), and they also have cucumber water, or hot tea. I sat in a lovely waiting room with a very relaxed atmosphere, relaxed lighting and spa music. You can tell this was very well thought out. The room, or studio itself is very small but fortunately the class was small so it worked out fine. She took some time to find out what some of our issues were and tailored the class to suit our needs which was AWESOME. She incorporated a tiny bit of reiki (again, SO cool), aroma therapy (smelled amazing! The oils were from a company called ""Tree Of India""), and she used this beautiful  bowlchime at the end of the session, which  gave out an exquisite vibration. My goal for the week: Learn about those chimes! I loved it!Their prices are on the high side, but the quality of personal attention and genuine care and knowledge I received from Karen tells me, in the long run it will be an excellent investment in my  health and well being.  I purchased a living social coupon to try them out, which made my initial introduction to this place very affordable...I never imagined potentially spending a lot on my  yoga practice, but after attending ONE class, I do believe I will purchase their three month unlimited program.I'm going back again tomorrow (Sunday) for their Yoga and Meditation class. Can't wait to see what other surprises are in store!

"TJ J. has it spot on. This place is the best! I am just getting started with yoga and I can't imagine going anywhere else. The classes are extremely small (and, consequentially, not intimidating at all) and the instructor and staff are delightful. I have been to other places where yoga is a giant scary class with 40 other people, which makes it sort of daunting to get started...not so here. The personal attention and the good energy are unbelievable! You will leave class feeling the best you ever have :) Really, do yourself a favor and check this place out.

"This wellness center is three things: quality, quality & quality.  I had the pleasure of taking my first class at this studio with Karen and I sincerely feel like a new man.  If you read any of my reviews, I only take the time to write about outstanding companies or services.  Thus this review.  I can't recommend classes here enough.  I sincerely feel great. The McLeod Wellness Center gets a ""Run, Don't Walk Award.""  Enroll and get here as soon as you can.

You can tell how passionate he is about life and thriving. I highly recommend ESC and Alaric to any one when they NEED to feel lighter.  I always leave ESC with a smile on my face. It is my home away from home and everyone there is so supportive of each other's paths.

"For some reason, I had a tremendous amount of anxiety about buying a new mattress. Maybe I was just self-conscious about rolling around on a bunch of beds in a public place. ABD Mattress quickly alleviated any idiotic fears I may have had. The store was empty when I arrived on a Monday afternoon and I was attended to immediately and never felt pressured. ABD has a great selection of mattresses, and the prices cannot be beat. I picked up a full plush pillow-top mattress for a cool $375 (without a box spring or a frame, since I already had one). Better yet Delivery is free AND prompt. You pick a three-hour timeframe, and the store will call you on the day of delivery to narrow it to a one-hour slot so you're not sitting around all afternoon.

"I'm a mattress buying novice. I also hate buying things that require you to try-before-you-buy. I also seem to give explanatory information about myself before reviews. Anyway. I had a lot of anxiousness about buying a mattress. If it's terrible, you'll be spending a large proportion of your life in misery until you fix the problem. Who wants that Especially for something that can be as expensive as a mattress These people were great. They patiently answered all of my mattress questions and treated me like a valued customer - both times I called, the man on the phone remembered my name (and number!) and took care of me. When I failed to buy a box spring (why oh why did I think I could go without a box spring) they were able to take care of me over the phone and get me a box spring in the SAME day. Within hours, even. They even helped me set up the mattress that I DIDN'T purchase from them, which blew me away. Their professionalism and friendliness are excellent. I will recommend them to everyone who's in the market for a mattress, especially students, because their student deals are fantastic.

"The only place to buy a mattress.Both my wife and I and our daughter desperately needed new mattresses so I decided to check this place out. We went on a Sunday afternoon and were the only ones in the store. Lee greeted us and showed us around the store. They offer mattresses, recliners, dinettes, daybeds, bunk beds and bedroom furniture. We found her a great mattress at a great price. While waking around the store my wife found a Serta iComfort series mattress for us that felt like heaven to lay on. Lee had told us about their free 18 month no interest financing through Wells Fargo Bank, free bed frame, free delivery and set up of your new bed and free removal of your old mattress and box spring which made it a no brainer! I went in to only buy our daughter a new mattress but I bought us a new one as well. No one can beat their prices! I compared the price of our new mattress to Levin, Macy's and Mattress Discounters. No one came close to the price we got at American Buyers. Everywhere else was double the price for just our mattress not including our daughters so it was like getting hers for free. Take it from me, when it comes to your sleep, DO NOT BUY A CHEAP MATTRESS!!! We bought a cheap, supposed Serta mattress in 2008 from Mattress Discounters. The boxed spring had to be replaced about 2 years after owning the bed. I don't think I will have that problem again as our new Serta has a full 25 year warranty. A couple days later our daughters mattress was delivered first and about a week later our new mattress was delivered. The delivery guys had our old mattress and box spring out and our new frame, box spring and mattress set up in less than 10 minutes.I highly recommend American Buyers Discount Mattress for all of your bedding needs.

"Sometime ago,I was looking for someone to service my Grandfather clocks in my home. After extensive research,I ran across these folks. I couldn't be happier with the result of their visitation. The knowledge they possess and the professionalism with which they practice,is impeccable! ALL of my clocks are running at peak performance;they even took the time to look at my ""Black Forest"" cuckoo clocks and passed on valuable advice as to how I should maintain them. I graciously appreciate their time,demeanor,and service! I wish no one else to service my clocks in the future! YOU CANNOT GO WRONG WITH THESE FOLKS! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! Thank-you so much for all that you have done to restore my precious time pieces!

"I can not express my thanks & gratitude enough to everyone at Paul's Clock Repair.  I needed an Atmos clock repaired, which was given to me by my mother who had recently passed away.  I needed it done on a short time line since I live out-of-town and was leaving soon.  It is next to impossible to find anyone who can actually fix that type of clock especially anywhere close to where I live.  They were so accommodating and really really helped me out during a hard time.  Much thanks to Lisa for spending the time to teach my about the clock & how to take care of it and her dad for fixing it up!  My Atmos clock is now working great and looks wonderful on my mantle!

"I love this store. I can just spend hours walking around getting ideas of things to either update or change around my house.All of the sales associates are very helpful and knowledgeable. Sometimes it's hard to find someone to help you because they are busy helping other customers.They even cut keys that actually work.

"I have purchased a few items from this company over the years as it is located just about a mile from my house.  Yes, they are expensive but as the old saying goes, ""You get what you pay for"".  In particular, about 15 years ago, I purchased an outdoor furniture set called Winston (48"" round glass table, 4 ultra high back chairs, recliner and an ottoman).  These were the sling style. At the time it was hard to swallow the price but the sales rep promised me the quality was untouchable.  Well, the sales rep was right.  I have had some neighbors go through multiple sets of ""cheaper"" outdoor furniture over the years.  Well after 15 years, finally the fabric started to give as I and my girlfriend both broke through the fabric. My girlfriend wanted to throw them out and buy new from a big box store. I was tempted to do that but then decided to look into spray painting the very durable aluminum frames and buying replacement slings for them.  I am very handy and decided to install the new slings myself to save some money.  I ran into a couple of road blocks as it was not as straight forward as it might sound. I called the store and spoke to a Marcy who was very helpful.  Instead of pushing me away or trying to sell me new, she allowed me to speak to the tech who gave me a few suggestions.  The result is we now have absolutely beautiful outdoor furniture again that is as comfortable as it was 15 years ago.  They look brand new and we are really glad we took the effort to re-do them.  We never would have been able to do this with the ""cheaper"" furniture.  Thanks to Marcy, Tom and others at the Fireplace and Patio Place for being so helpful.  It made the initial price not so bad after all.  In fact if you do the math, these are now downright inexpensive if you divide the price paid by the number of years we go out of them.  So it does pay to buy good quality stuff and this store has plenty of good quality.We also purchased a stainless steel TEC grill about 13 years ago and the same hold true for that. My friends laughed at me when they heard how much I paid for it but they have gone through many cheaper grills and mine still looks brand new.  I did have to replace a few parts and the glass cooking plate a few times but it still looks and operates as good as it did on day 1.We also purchased a 2 different gas logs sets for our 2 fireplaces although we don't really use them much these days.  Maybe if the price of natural gas comes down we might use them more.

"Elizabeth from The Botanical Emporium did my wedding flowers and they were absolutely beautiful! They were so easy to work with and made me feel completely at ease. My flowers were everything I ever wanted and more. When I saw my bouquet it actually brought tears to my eyes! The greenhouse is amazing!  I very highly recomend the Botanical Emporium for all of your floral needs.

"What a cool place! I have NO green thumb WHATSOEVER, but had passed by for about a year now since I moved to Dormont and had always thought the shop looked cute. Now was my chance as I needed a last minute Christmas present for my grandma. The place is larger than you think from the outside. They actually have a whole outdoor area that's covered for the winter with many different plants I couldn't identify. I thought the owner was super duper sweet and just really energetic. Her and another staff member helped me pick out a plant that was in a vase, not in a pot, and looked really cool and modern. I loved it and had a fleeting thought to pick one up myself... if I wouldn't kill it (which I probably would!). I had commented about a table full of vases filled with what looked like works of art. They turned out to be flower displays for hotels, but man where they cool. If I was doing an event or having a wedding, that's exactly what I would have wanted. They just looked really modern but creative. They also have some winged friends you can say hi to, including one screaming one in the back that you can't see. Kinda creepy, but I guess that comes with a unique shop! I will absolutely be back to pick up items for people and consider them for any events I have coming up.

"This is a great kitchen store.  They have a cooking demonstration room that you can rent out.  My wife had her bridal shower here and her guests loved it.  It was different than the typical, stale shower; plus everyone got a discount that day to shop the store.They have all kind of gourmet gadgets & appliances that you'd see in Williams-Sonoma but the prices are a little better, I think.  The staff is super helpful and will go out of their way to help you.  Look for their All-Clad ""seconds"" sales.  This is when All-Clad merchandise is on sale that has minor (and I mean minor) defects.  You can get top notch pots and pans at half the price.  We stocked our kitchen with them and they are amazing.  It's the kind of deal where maybe there is a scratch on them, but really you're going to use them once and scratch them up anyway!!!  Seriously, go visit these folks!

"My sister has a bucket list - and from this bucket list I bought her Christmas gift this year. One of her items was to learn how to make sushi. I asked around and found Crate! A friend of mine had taken a sushi class there and LOVED it, so I had total confidence in buying the class for my sister and I to do together. When I first searched, they didn't have a sushi class on the schedule. I emailed them to find out and they said to check back in the spring. As I was scrambling two weeks before Christmas to figure something else out to get my sister, they emailed ME and said that they added a sushi class for February and for me to go register so I'd have it in time for my sister for Christmas. It was really nice because I had already started looking for something else, so great on the sales end on their part.There were 18 people in our class and we were in the demonstration kitchen. We learned how to roll three different types of sushi, and all of the steps that go along with it. Everyone had such a great time making their own sushi, and eating it too! I signed up for the email newsletter, and I'm already thinking of occasions to rent it out for private parties! It made a great gift; my sister loved it!

"This is SUCH a gorgeous boutique -- shabby chic furnishings galore! If you're in the market for truly unique, special furniture and live anywhere near Pittsburgh, Hot Haute Hot is the place you're looking for. I came here with my friend who had long been on a quest to find a new dining room table. The options here were so gorgeous I was immediately struck with envy. There are curio cabinets, amazing reclaimed ceiling tile mirrors, plush chairs, fantastic lamps and a bevy of side tables, wall hangings and of course, dining room tables. The service is impeccable -- sweet, helpful women who know every item in their shop and are just as excited to help you shop as you are to find perfect item. The taste level in this store is impressive, as well. As a bonus, they have a few displays of fun, affordable jewelry ranging from delicate to super funky. Take your time to pick through this shop and enjoy yourself while doing it -- I certainly did!

"My husband and I moved to Mt. Lebanon last year from out of state, and we love going to Rollier's. Neither of us are particularly ""handy"" so when we go there we rely on the staff working in the departments to help us with our home repair needs. Together we have gone to talk to different people about: indoor paint to combat smoke smell, de-humidifiers & outdoor gardens and have always received friendly, well-rounded and detailed information. A man even helped me figure out how to hang curtains without using a power drill, when I came in very flustered not being able to get screws directly into the wall (I told you guys I wasn't handy!).I also want to praise Rollier's for their selection of HIGH END PET FOODS! I think they should advertise this more because it is very difficult to find these pet foods in the South Hills. They brands including but not limited to: Orijien, Fromm's, Wellness & Taste of The Wild. We do rotation feeding with our pets, so a variety of high end pet foods is a must! I hope they start carrying Addiction Pet Foods soon. Would also be great if they carried bio-bags, bio-degradable dog waste bags.My husband and I are on a modest income, but we prefer to support local business as much as we can. We will continue to shop here because of the friendly, knowledgeable staff, convenient to location to our home and wide-range of products.

"Imagine those hardware stores you see on tv  movies where the you can go and know that you will get reliable help, well Rolliers is that place. The concept of customer service and expertise is not something of a past era. I have been here more than a dozen times for reasons and I have never left disappointed. I walked in with door knob pieces for a 100 year old door - not only did they know exactly what I was looking for, they had dozens to choose from to make sure that I had the exact ones I needed. I could only imagine the look of bewilderment that I would get if I walked into that big orange or blue ""home centers"" with the same questions. I have gone back since and will continue to go back over and over again because I trust what I am told when I ask questions - something that is hard to find these days. Yeah, some of the items might be a little more costly (not much from my experience) but that extra pays for customer service that you don't get from someplace that is concerned with shareholder profits. I would rather pay a little more and know that I am getting what I need for the job the first time rather than wasting my time over and over again.

"Buying a new bike can be a big decision.  Buying a gimmicky electric bike could be a bad decision.  Buying electronics from a produce market could be questionable decision. And lastly buying anything over $500 from a place that is located south of downtown, cash only, and offers no warrantiesreturns... seems to put the nail in the coffin for logical decisions.  But some how myself and dozens of other logical people have had a excellent to OK experience when doing all of the above.Phoenix Produce is selling Fujiton E-Bikes straight off the boat from China.  And we're not talking ""Made in China"" hidden in some innocuous spot; this is legitimately Chinese...from the oddly sized tires (which makes it a little difficult to find tubes for) to the MandarinCantonese (not actually sure which) that fills the instrument panel and indicator lights.Phoenix Produce carries two models 36v and 48v both have max speed of 20 MPH.  While they differ in range 22 miles and 30 miles, respectively, on a single charge.  The motor definitely has good torque for a little electric motor...I've heard the 48v is even better than my 36v.  Both plug directly into a 110V (normal) outlet.  The 36v costs a little more than 3 CENTS per charge. These are bikes, so you can ride them on sidewalks or other bike designated paths.  No licenseregistrationinsurancehelmet required (legally per ARS 28-2516)...though the helmet is recommended.As for the no warranties and returns part...I can only say what I've experienced.  Sam, the owner of Phoenix Produce, has been very good to me in all my dealings.  I had some initial problems with the battery and charger of the bike, making the first week of ownership less than stellar.  Fortunately, I talked to Sam about those issues and he corrected the problems no charge...sure seemed like a warranty; but Jenny, one of his employees, said ""He is just really fair.""  And I have to agree.  For the price you cannot beat them approximately $500 a little higher or lower depending on the model of your choice.

"This place is great! I wish I had found it before our last day and on the way to the airport. This place has fresh fruits and nuts and breads. There are a bunch of samples and quite a good selection of items. The staff is also very nice. We picked up a loaf of pumpkin bread as a thank you for our ride from the airport once we got home. I think they liked it, I know we loved our samples. If you are in the area, I definitely would go in to this place. I think it is probably a bit more than the market, but the produce is very fresh.

"This is my favorite place to visit for some delicious fruit, sandwiches, and incredibly friendly people. Upon entering, the staff will offer you free samples of the fruit they have to offer. I enjoy picking up local or organic fruits and vegetables and supporting the last remaining fruit stand left along Baseline Rd. Before the push to build along South Mountain, there were several others that lined the street. When the City of Phoenix widened the road, they took away the left hand turn to make it easily into the parking lot. I refuse to let such an inconvenience keep me from a place that I share with all of my friends, when I can get the chance. If you want to support a local business, experience real hospitality, and find something delicious to eat then I highly recommend Summers Fruit Barn.

"I've got something of a love affair with this place. It's becoming a regular part of my life now... and I am okay with that.In the past, I would go here for lunch... their freshly made sandwiches are absolutely delicious. Given that I now work about 25 miles from here, that's somewhat... difficult. So instead I now go here after my early morning South Mountain hikes. Turns out their smoothies are quite fantastic as well. I believe the general consensus amongst my friends and I has been ""heaven in our mouths.""On top of that, their selection of local produce and related products is unrivaled. Delicious fresh fruit (of which they're usually handing out samples), local honey, locally made salad dressings, salsas, jams, and much much more, make this place to die for. I get all of my best fruit here, without a doubt.One thing to note though is that you should bring cash here! There is a small additional charge for paying with your credit card, as it's expensive for them to process.

"Where do you go When an Alaskan Wants to Take a Box of Oranges HomeSummers.  They also ship.  On a Saturday I could head West or South and find any number of Estebans and Juans selling naranjas, elotes y muy mas from the back of a pickup or car.  Wednesday  Baseline Road, once the home of many fruit, vegetable and flower merchants.  Summers is the last one in Phoenix, and a good one it is.  Clean, neat, a wide variety of fruits, produce, jellies, sauces, salsa, honey, dried fruits, nuts, dates, bread and a host of old timey tourist products like cactus candy, grow a saguaro cactus, agave, etc. kits, and things I can't remember this evening.  They also have newer items like scorpion pops - the embedded scorpion bolos, or any bolo, are out of fashion, long live scorpion suckers!  If you bake bread, you must add value, right  Summers has a large variety of fresh breads and a wheat field's worth of of sandwich choices, plus a milk parlor's worth of shakes and a mango plantation worth of smoothies.  It's a great place.  Don't keep driving past like me.  Swing by, get some produce, grab a sandwich and drink, and sit down at a table under the east portico and enjoy old-style AZ.

"Summers in Phoenix... So great, all year around!I come to Phoenix a couple times a year on business, and one of a handful of things I do, without fail, is come to Summers Fruit Barn. If I'm having a rough week, just going there is relaxing to me. It is, essentially, an old, classic roadside attraction that offers some amazing stuff.The place has been there as long as I can remember, way back when Baseline Road was quite rural, and now that the area is growing up all around it, I really hope Summers stays. My trips to the area would be incomplete without a stop by to pick up some goodies.Great people, simple style, excellent seasonal collection. Cash is best, but not required.I saw ""K. D.'s"" review, said he returned honey. But over on Google, Kabir Duggal (same person) griped about returning bread. Methinks Kabir has a personal problem with Summers, I'd take that review with a grain of salt.

"A favorite spot for lunch on the weekends.  You order up your food in a little farmhouse.  Pick from a selection of farm fresh sandwiches, salads, soups, and fresh baked goods.  Everything is very good.  Then grab a picnic table in the pecan grove and enjoy the fresh air, Arizona sunshine, and serene view of South Mountain stretching before you.  This is a great place to take the whole family.  The kids can run around and play while you enjoy a meal out.  A perfect day in the country without having to leave the city.

"We went to the Farm to check out the Farmer's Market and go to lunch.  It was amazing.  I can't believe this is only 15 minutes from my cookie cutter stucco house.  It's almost hard to believe it's even in Phoenix - though to a native like me, it's just one more reason to remember why Phoenix is so great.  When most folks used to think of South Phoenix they thought of crime, blight and anything else associated with being on the ""wrong"" side of the tracks.  Sure, there may have been areas right next to downtown that were like that, but most of South Phoenix was all farming community.  While some of this still exists - especially near and in Laveen - most of these farm plots were sold off during the years to individuals for their own homes - and any of the large lots were sold off to developers in the last 10-15 years or so.  Most of these became mass produced houses (like mine) or shopping centers.  The Farm is off of 32nd street (with property stretching back almost to 24th street) between Baseline and Southern.   To put this in perspective - there is a huge TargetFry'sRossApplebee's kind of complex at 24th and Baseline - and the South Mountain Community College is just North of that on 24th.  At 32nd and Baseline there is the Raven Golf course, with lots of condos all around it.  That all seems a whole world away once you pull in to The Farm.I'm attaching some pictures from their web site www.thefarmatsouthmountain.com.  I've been only to one of the restaurants so far - The Farm Kitchen which is their lunch spot.  But I plan to visit Morning Glory soon.  All the stores are amazing - and it's so cool to see where it all grows.  As we walked by the gardens it was great to see some kids (and adults) having the process explained to them of how they grow the food organically here - and it could end up at one of their restaurants, in one of the nicer restaurants in the valley, or sold at their Farmers market to be eaten in their own home.Check out their menus online.  Yes - it's a bit pricey.  I was hesitant that I'd think it was ""worth it"".  But oh it was.  I can't explain it any better than stealing from a commercial - You can TASTE the freshness!  Everything just tasted so much better.  Not that the atmosphere didn't help - but it wasn't the only factor.  One interesting thing to mention - pets are ok.  There were two folks there who brought their dogs.  The doggies seemed quite happy to have some run around space (leashed of course) and then a nice meal by a picnic bench.  I'm planning to go again - bringing lots of friends and family at different times.  I'd love to try out their yoga andor gardening classes too! This will definitely be on the short list of places a visitor needs to go when visiting from out of town.  Better yet though - it's one of the few places you can go in town and feel like you took a day trip out of the valley.

"A favorite spot for lunch on weekends!!! God.  I hate you guys. This restaurant makes me want to move to Tempe!!!!!!!!  Does not compare to ONE, not even ONE sandwich place I can think of in the east bay.  I got the Pecan chicken salad sandwich and Billy got the steak sandwich, hands down, best sandwich this side of the fucking mississippi.  All outdoor seating, so be forewarned, if the weather is not good, you'll have to maybe escape to an air conditioned car somewhere to enjoy your mayo while it's still good.One thing I just can't understand...  We were steered to this place by two peeps at the Fry's down the street after atleast five minutes of head scratch.  Now wait one goshdern second people!!!  How could you even question the all supreme sandiwch gods when it comes to the caliber of this place  Please.  If I worked at a Fry's nearby, this place would be my fucking fall back plan in a second.  I'll stop now.

"We went for brunch on the recommendation of some friends that live in the area.  What a great choice!  The setting is fantastic....you're just outside in a great little garden area.  And the food was amazing.  I'm a bit of a champagne nut (I think I mention champagne in every review I write....) and I loved the fact that they give you a mini bottle and a mini carafe of oj to mix yourself!  I also found it funny that the woman at the table next to ours used all of her OJ and I used only a little bit....mmmmm...its just to color, right ;)

"this place is great, but i am partial to anywhere that offers outside dining possibilities. actually, it's only outside dining, picnic tables, to be exact.the Farm is just that, with an attached lunch counter to get chicken salad sandwiches with pecans, both fresh from on site. Tons of tall, shady trees, picnic tables and wandering ducks and birds to delight the kiddies.

"This is some CLASSY brunch.  I love it.Hot damn, it was warm this morning, but not enough to make a difference on a 5-star place like The Farm at South Mountain.  I was in a rush to try this place out this weekend before it closed.  (FYI, it closes every summer from June - September.)You pull up to the place in the midst of this vast city of ours to find a huge, and shady (in a good way) farm before you.  At the Morning Glory Cafe, the small menu has just the right mix of items to please just about anyone.  Lots of veggie options to be had here, btw (Bonnie would DROOL with desire here).The food is really incredible.  They had my favorite dish on the menu - croque madame.  It had eggs, and some delicious asiago cheese and black forest ham on some crusty artisanal bread.  Ahh.  It was missing the bechamel sauce, but it made up for it with freshly-grown asparagus.  How did they know that's my favorite veggie  I attribute it to kismet, of course.  It was accompanied by some terrific oven roasted potatoes baked in some spices and oil.  Nice...The patio is cute in a rustic way.  Think checker tablecloths and white plastic chairs.  Not exactly sexy, but hey, it fits in the grand scheme of the farm.  They have a self serve area for water, lemonade and tea.  The mimosas here are the best part.  For only $7.50 you get your own mini champagne bottle and orange juice.  So you're getting the better end of the bargain with about a mimosa and a half! Service here was a bit slow to start.  But after paying the check I spot a wandering blueberry scone that is calling my name.  (Even better, is their scones are featured in Cooking Light magazine too.  Man I love this place.) So I give in, place an order and ask for it to go.  She brings it out.  I ask to pay in cash, since she already ran my debit card, and she says ""Don't worry about it.""  CLASSY.  Classy, with a C.  The scone was DELICIOUS, btw.  Nice touch, and I leave her an extra tip for it. Prices are higher than average for Phoenix.  Expect to throw down about $40 for two.  But let me tell ya, that will be the best $40 you've spent in a while. I am now eager to try the other restaurants here.  Now if only September would hurry up and arrive....

"I can't say enough good things about this place.  I was introduced to it when a couple of friends of mine got married here.  I am still impressed by it five years later.  There are a few eating options here, a couple of restaurants and a large picnic area.  It's an oasis in the middle of south Phoenix.  The area around it is nice too, the old farming lifestyle all around.  If you weren't around in Phoenix twenty years ago, you can see the type of farming pockets that used to exist in more frequency around the city.  The only thing missing is an orange orchard with the trees painted white at the trunks.

"This is about the ONLY reason I miss my old job: it was right around the corner from ""The Farm"".The first time I went, I thought it was so peaceful to be in a city!  I love the outdoor picnic tables and their potato salad is to die for!  It reminds me of my small town back East.  Friendly, open-air, with good, homemade food.

"I took my out-of-town visitor here based on the rave reviews other yelpers gave it and, let me just say, there was no disappointment!  It was a bit chilly because we had to eat outside in mid-January, but they had heat lamps out to make sure people didn't freeze their arses off (however, it would be wise to bring a jacket depending on how sensitive to cold ya are).As soon as we got there, a nice young waitress brought out a basket of scones and muffins in case we wanted to buy any for $2.95.  I had some kind of almond sweet delicious-ness of a muffin and it was well worth the 3 bucks.  I then ordered a la carte and had eggs and rosemary taters.  My friend had a mushroom and tomato omelette.  Boy did we enjoy ourselves.  It was a very pleasant, airy, light-hearted kind of environment, complete with little finches chirping and flitting about here and there as if you were in the movie ""Willow"" or something.  My friend couldn't deny the finches crumbs from her tasty herbed biscuit.  If it were me, I woulda scarfed down the whole thing and said to hell with the finches. Either way, we both had a wonderful time.  It was a great way to end her visit to Arizona before her flight back to North Carolina.  Although the prices were a little bit on the higher side (hovering around 10 bucks a dish, including bottomless coffee), it was well worth it.  And it's also refreshing to visit a breakfast place that actually attempts to be organic and doesn't deep-fry everything it serves.

"YUM!There's not much which hasn't already been said.  I had brunchbreakfast with my fiance, a friend, and an out of towner with his friend.  We had breakfast at the Morning Glory Cafe and it was delicious!  Three of us had mimosas (Thanks Kristin for the tip on those - they were delicious and too cute with the individual bottles) and the serve yourself beverage bar was convenient.  I had french toast with a side of potatoes and my fiance had the monte cristo with a side of bacon.  I would recommend both entrees.  We both ate all of our food (which was a lot) and didn't feel overly full, which was nice.  The potatoes were delicious and the bacon was so-so.  You would think for $2.50 you would get 3-4 thick, juicy slices of bacon.  Instead, you get 2 kinda puny, nothing-to-write-home-about strips.The atmosphere is fun and earthy.  Too bad it was overcast and a little chilly.  Otherwise, it would have been perfect.  It's a nice setting in the midst of ""the farm"" complete with veggies growing and chickens in the coop (beware of the smell folks if you wander in that direction).  There are also other vendors selling art, jewelery, and other pieces.  My favorite was watching the man selling bread.  He seemed like the nicest man and was so happy to pair a person with the perfect loaf.  My fiance didn't get that from watching him, but I could tell.  We went over to buy some bread and he was in fact one of the most genuinely jolly people I've met - and I don't use the word ""jolly"" very often, but it fits him perfectly.  He had us smell the asiago loaf, introduced us to the jalapeno Cheddar, and finally sold us on the rosemary with sea salt.  It was $7, which I would normally think is ridiculous, but for as often as I'll probably make it out here, I bet I'll buy a loaf from him every time if he's around.  The happy bread guy is worth the last star for me.

"I love the 3 P's, produce, people, and prices. This is the freshest produce I have found for really good prices and the people who work here always seem to have a good time.   If the produce is in season, the prices are just right.  They also have a good selection of locally produced jams, snacks, and honey.

"Even if you don't live in the east Valley, it's worth the time and gas to buy your produce at the Superstition Market in Mesa. The prices are low and for the most part, the quality is good. Today I got cranberries for $0.50 a pound. Sweet potatoes were $0.49 a pound and yellow onions just $0.39 a pound.The markets have weekly specials and prices are rarely what the supermarkets charge for fresh fruit and vegetables. Check them out and start saving on your family's food bills. The staff is friendly and helpful. We eat really well all year, thanks to this market.

"Great prices great place to buy your produce. Good value but you have to use it quickly the produce doesn't keep for long
",1
"Okay, so it can take a little time to find the ""best"" -- and the produce generally isn't visually the best but the quality and price are still way, way above anyplace else. I also like that they have specialty items -- artisan breads, jellies, local honey -- and the prices still don't drive you away!

"I love this place! Where else can you find clamshells of blueberries for $.59 Last week they had peaches for $.69lb. I always stock up and freeze what I can.Watch what you grab because you can end up with some over ripe items but it's worth the couple of extra minutes for the excellent deals.

"I really love the products and service I have received from Boxed Greens. The unique and delicious produce is amazing and I love the fact that I can order it all over the phone and have it delivered to my front door. They even carry my favorite cleaning supplies!!!!!

"This is the way food should taste!!  I remember eating tomatoes right out of my grandmother's garden and the organic fruits and vegetables from Boxed Greens taste just as fresh!!  Things from the store just are not the same or as healthy for you.  The earl ybird option for us works great.  Like getting fresh milk ""back in the olden days"".  (not that I'm that old).  If there is ever a problem I can call them up and the friendly staff is willing to solve the problem right away. You won't go wrong by making the healthy   choice by ordering from Boxed Greens!!

"The organic vegetables are fresh. The staff is nice.Boxed Greens is located north east of Elliot and I 10 in Tempe Arizona.  The entrance is located north of Todd Street on the east side of the building. The entrance says Grove Commons.  They need 24 hours notice for pick ups.

"It's 115 degrees F outside and you've got burn marks on your butt from sitting on the leather seat in your car trying to make it to Chinatown through the underpass as fast as you can. There's traffic. ""Damn tourists are everywhere!"" you mutter underneath your breath. You think that waiting for the light to change at Paradise underneath the monorail shade might just help....especially since your ac went out the other day. But the traffic pushes you just barely out of the shade and into the blazing noon sun. You cry out in pain, ""Dang this sucks!"" They keep saying it's a dry heat...but it still hurts. Solution You need a cool refreshing fruit slushy boba....and you need it fast!As far as boba goes....I prefer mine with fresh fruit. I don't subscribe to the powdered mixes that some people prefer bc I find them far too saccharine. Even other boba shops that purport to make fresh fruit slushies make it far too sweet for my tastes. If you're like me, this non-descript, unassuming little shop inside the Chinatown Plaza mall (just to the right, 2 stores down from the entrance) makes some of the absolute best fresh fruit slushies with boba I've ever had in the bay area, NYC, Houston and elsewhere - prolly a near perfect 10 for me!The boba itself is done right - not too hard, not too soft. It comes a bit warm like all places, which then melts the fruit slush a bit more....tempering the sweetness even more. They have an extensive menu choice for fresh fruit - mango, watermelon, etc. (Just look to the side shelf and you'll see all the fresh fruit they buy to make their creations!) They even run seasonal specials - look for the signs near the counter. My fave The watermelon with boba. Otherwise, the kiwi or the honey dew melon are close seconds! This is totally a mom & pop joint and not some bubble tea mecca like Tea Planet just a few doors down. So not much space to sit in...but just order a couple and sit on the steps of the plaza near the entrance to cool off from that Las Vegas summer heat..or walk around and peruse the store next door for some pretty kitschy stuff - we once saw a belt buckle with the LV sign saying ""Welcome to fabdau Las Vegas"". That's awesome.I don't like their coffee, or black tea versions of boba. For that I'd go elsewhere (TP seems to be the best), but they do one thing better than those other places - cheap, fresh fruit slushies that aren't too sweet. 5 stars for the ""No. 1 Boba""! They're ""fabdau""!

"I buy my Halloween pumpkins and Christmas trees here every year (unless we go to the farm and chop them ourselves). I try to buy all my fresh produce here-it's cheap and good quality and LOCAL! They also sell jamsjellies as well as other kitchen condiments, nuts of all kind, seasonal fresh produce, farm produces such as milk, cheeses, eggs and some fresh meat. They have seasonal flowers and plants for sale (think: mums and poinsettias this time of year; geraniums (and other flowers) and fresh herbs in the summerspring... They also sell firewood!The staff is SUPER FRIENDLY, they accept credit cards, I couldn't say enough good things about Hillbilly!

"I love Hillbilly Market and come here for my local produce and meats! I love supporting local agriculture even if it is a couple more bucks. The prices are great! I love getting their green tomatoes and grapefruits. The grapefruits are the best I've found in the area. This is the only place I have found green tomatoes for sale. They also have a great selection of local meats including great affordable country ham. I will continue to shop here for my various random wants and needs! I can't wait to check out their summer selection of produce and plants.

"Great tomatoes locally grown and priced with that backyard vegetable garden taste.  Can't beat it.  An array of seasonal fruits and produce as well. Plus jams, jellies, cider, all sorts of pickled vegetables.  Give 'em a whirl.  It's worth a trip.

"My family has been going here since I was in pre-school, and they have always had delicious apples, fresh cider, candles, honey, and raspberries. Plus, they are family-owned and so friendly.
",1
"Just went here today with my husband and kids.  A lovely, peaceful orchard with a nice variety of pick-your-own apples at a very reasonable price ($1 per pound as of today).  They also have an impressive variety of pre-picked apples inside the store, including lots of interesting heirloom varieties (such as Ashmead's Kernel, which I had never heard of until today, but once I read the description I just couldn't leave without buying some).  They keep their website updated so that you know what's available that week.  The grounds are well-kept and the family that owns the orchard was very friendly.  I was bummed that they were all out of cider today, but that gives me a reason to come back!

"When I get sick, I kind of get happy. Not because that means my diet will most likely consist of soup and ice cream since those are my sick comfort foods but because of Carmel Family Physicians.I've been going here for the past 5yrs and could not be happier with the treatment I've gotten. From bronchitis to strep throat to sinus infections to upper respiratory infections to food poisoning--they've helped me with almost everything under the sun. They are located right near the CMC off 51 and 485 and have very convenient hours---I'm talking until 8P on weeknights plus Saturday and Sunday walk in hours. In the past I've been able to call in for an appointment the same day which is pretty much unheard of at any doctor's office I've been to. They have a number of doctors and physician assistants there Clint Price is awesome, so see him!Nice staff, recent magazines, in and out within 20 minutes. Yeah, I dig.
",1
"My doctor is Jessica Kaiser - she's one hell of a lady.  They have a new online system that you can make appointments and ask for refills with, which is very convenient.I think she's the greatest MD I've ever had :)

"Love this place , friendly staff and techs . Dr. Olulade is da bomb! Nice to have a primary that actually cares about you and makes you feel comfy .

"Although much farther away from my work or home than my previous doctor in Charlotte, the extra drive to Northwest Family Physicians is always worth it (if I leave on time and don't get caught behind any school buses on the way).  Dr. William Larsen was recommended to me and I'm glad I switched my primary care to him.  I receive such great care from Dr. Larsen and I feel comfortable talking to him openly and honestly.  Best of all, he doesn't rush in and out of the room.  He takes the time to sit and listen to you to understand everything that may be affecting your current symptoms.  The staff has always been great, too.  Doctor appointments are usually last-minute things for me (because I'm dying or something) and they can always get me in when it's convenient for ME.  I appreciate that and that says a lot about their service.
",1
"I mean Dr. William Larsen's place.  Not just so close to my house, the staff are so friendly, considerate and passionate.I rarely visit doctors' office and hard to find a good one in Charlotte, nevertheless, my previous insurance did not refer me to this place but gave me a couple that I had never had a treatment as I got lost in downtown or I could not find the place.Four years ago, my son got a physical for college entrance and we accidentally went to Dr. Larsen's office.  Like them.Early this year, I had a serious chest infection, got an appointment quick and had that fixed fast.  Then my boyfriend was referred by insurance to other place that he could hardly find.  After checking he could go to Dr. Larsen, my boyfriend was so happy with their service. I just got my physical quick appointment with no hassle and check up the following day.Good place.
",1
"I'm leaving Charlotte and dreading finding a new doctor because Dr. Larsen has been a fantastic doctor for the past 2 years. Making an appointment is easy, the staff is fantastic. Dr. Larsen takes his time and answers questions. He's correctly addressed any medical issue I've had. In addition, if relevant for you, he's LGBT-friendly (I found him on the Gay and Lesbian Medical Association). I can't speak to the abilities of the female doctor there, whose name escapes me, but Larsen is gold!
",1
"Fantasic and very friendly staff! The best in Charlotte hands down!
",1
"I have been seeing Dr. Larsen for more than 6 years.  I can not begin to tell you how happy I am with his practice.  I manage a medical practice of my own and belive me I know how difficult it can be to provice quality care and good customer service.  The have accomplished it every visit.  Wait times are always a possiblity in a medical facility, but they have never been an issue with Dr. Larsen (usually 5-15 minutes).Dr. Larson is extremely personal and professional.  I never feel like a number with him or his staff.  He has gone out of his way to make sure I've gotten the care I needed, even when I had a lapse in insurance coverage.  His office is 20 minutes from my home and 45 minutes from my work.  I gladly drive there and will continue to do so.
",1
"Northwest Family Physicians is the best!  I have been going there for about 10 years or more. Incredible service all around.   Dr. Larsen is my favorite physician ever. He is very personable, friendly, and professional - - and even in these fast times, ALWAYS takes time to listen intently to every concern (even if I have a list) without judgement - a model for all doctors to follow and live up to.  He's very logical and thorough, so I know there is no stone left unturned.  And it's always clear during these discussions that he is up-to-date on the latest in medicine. I moved to Durham, NC, over a year ago and he's still my primary physician!  Wouldn't have it any other way!  Dr. Larsen's nurses are also great - friendly, professional, and very attentive (won't name names - don't want to miss anyone).

"Amazing staff and doctor.  I've been seeing Dr. Larsen for years and trust his diagnosis.

"Dr Austin is incredibly thorough with pt and family history. She personally spent a lot of time with me. Dr. Austin has awesome bedside manners and is very personable. This is a small well run office. Staff is also personable. Dr. Austin is a stellar example of a great doctor. I can't imagine that a patient would be turned away if they showed up in need without an appointment.
",1
"Dr. Austin is an amazing physician.  She is compassionate, caring and thorough.  She is the only physician in her office, which means when she needs to provide more time to patients before you, you will wait.  But guess what, one day that may be you--you may need that extra time.  So I have never once been upset if my appointment wasn't started at the exact minute it was scheduled.  She has been my primary doctor for over seven years and unless she retires, she will be my primary physician for the foreseeable future.  If your treatment requires more specialized treatment, she knows who and where to send you.  As a middle aged man I purposely chose Dr. Austin because she is smart, compassionate, listens, thorough and has never once said ""fully booked"" when I've asked to see her for ANY reason that day.If you are looking for a great doctor, Dr. Austin is it 100%.

"You never know how awesome a service or staff is until shit hits the fan and it's crunch time. For this reason, Dr. Bauer and her assistant deserve way more than 5 stars, and I owe everyone an update on this review.I've had a handful of doctor's appointments over the past few weeks, four of them with Dr. Bauer. Not once have I had an issue and every single time there is nothing but helpfulness whenever I have to have yet another crazy unheard of test ran. They've spent countless hours working on the paperwork I need to submit with all the results without appearing hassled or bothered. They've also promptly called me when my results are in or for any other status update I request.Additionally, they are very patient when my prescription company acts like an asshat. Due to circumstances I needed to have a 6 month fill of my prescription rather than the typical 3 month I receive. When I emailed my prescription company, they told me this was possible if the doctor's office called it in. However, my doctor's assistant tried several times and got nowhere. Today I was there with her and she patiently tried one last time and made sure my prescription went through as requested. It was something that she really didn't need to do but kindly did for me despite how much of a pain in the ass it was.Without a doubt I recommend Dr. Bauer and her assistant 110%.
",1
"I love my doctors.  They are so respectful.  I went in today with serious pain.  My main doctor's partner saw me, as my primary doc was out of town.  She introduced herself, asked me a lot of questions about my symptoms, examined me, and made several recommendations.  Surprisingly, one of them was to see a chiropractor for an evaluation, as the problem seemed to be with the muscles and bones of my ribcage.  Dr. Mansfield prescribed some low-key meds (ibuprofen and a muscle relaxer) and referred me to an awesome chiropractor right next door.  I got the best night's sleep in recent memory, and the pain seems to have decreased some already.  The office staff is courteous and efficient.  I hated to leave my old doctor, who I'd seen for many years, but she moved her office way out to southeast Gilbert.  Mountain View is just a few miles from my office.  I'm glad I made the change.

"This doctor's office is AMAZING!! I always see Dr. Collins but have seen others when I'm sick and she's booked. Not only are they speedy (10 minutes or less in waiting room) but the front office in general is very capable and helpful when any insurance issues have come up. Dr. Collins really cares about you as a person and your overall health and even calls with test results if it's anything out of the norm (or even if I was just a little worried about them).  She also is very personable and non judgmental when I tell her the truth about how many cocktails I indulge in on a weekend - although she continually tries to encourage me to stop having 6 cocktails on a Friday night  I also feel like I can tell her the truth without feeling like I'm in the Principal's office. Best part by far is when I didn't have health insurance for a few months between jobs they were super accommodating with my cash pay situation, didn't rip me off, and cared enough to tell me exactly where to go for cheaper med prices and weren't so far into in the drug companies pockets like most doctors to insist on pricey meds or name brand medications.p.s. Dr. Collins doesn't accept new patients but if you call and ask her medical assistant they usually can fit you in...
",1
"I met with Doctor Mayy Deadrick a few weeks ago and immediately felt at ease. I can tell that she will be a wonderful family doctor. Best of all, Mountain View is home to several doctors so we should always be able to get in the same day or the day after we get sick. The waiting room felt clean and comfortable too, which is a big plus for any doctor's office.
",1
"If you're looking for a superb doctor who has a wonderful bedside manner, look no further than Dr. Dena Cornelius! She is one of the best, most caring and thorough doctor I've ever had.  She truly cares about her patients, making time to talk to you about all your concerns.  I can't say enough about her and highly recommend her!
",1
"I love this place!! I moved here 7 months ago and made an apt with Dr. Mansfield. She is awesome and so is her assistant!!  She's easy to talk to and will do anything to help! I've been a few times and will return again and again!
",1
"Best. Doc's Office. EVER. My primary care doc is Dr. Mansfield and she is AMAZING.... as is her assistant. I don't know what I'd do without them. I've also been to other docs if I'm really sick and can't get in to see her, and they've all been great. The front desk staff is very friendly and quick with processing people through. You never have to wait long with an appointment and they have a streamlined process to get people through to a doc quick, but not so quick that you feel like you're just a number. They listen to what you have to say and don't just give you meds for the sake of giving you meds.... which I LOVE! These guys rock!!
",1
"I love this doctors office.  Dr. Mansfield is always willing to listen and is very compassionate.  She is genuinely concerned about her patients and their health.  Whenever you have an urgent matter the office goes above and beyond to make sure you get to see a doctor immediately.  I've been a patient here for about three years and am so glad to have found this doctor.

"Dr. Bauer had great reviews and so did the facility so this is ultimately why I chose to come here. I haven't had a primary in over 2 years I think and need a referral to an ENT so I decided that I needed to develop a relationship with a Dr. and maintain it since I plan on being here for a while.The facility is right down the street from my house so nice and convenient. It is HUGE but they have a map at the entrance of the parking lot. When you walk in, you are immediately greeted by the girls at the front desk. They promptly take your information and have you sign the remaining paperwork if you didn't finish it online. You then wait for another lady to take your co-pay. From what it seems this office runs like a well oiled machine, but I thought it was interesting that the woman was copying the co-pays on paper in an old fashioned receipt book. It didn't take long, so I don't really care, I just would have figured since they have online technology for their patients that they would have something for themselves.Anyway, a nurse came and got me and did the whole vitals thing and checked height and weight and what not and then I was placed in a room to wait for Dr. Bauer. It took her about 5 minutes and she was in and introducing herself, reviewing my paperwork and talking to me about me. She was really nice and straightforward which I liked - down to business. Please don't take it for her being impersonal because it isn't, shes a busy doctor and wants to give you the best focus she can and I like that.She checked me out and everything was fine as I knew and she also quickly gave me a referral for an ENT in the same building and had me request my old records. For a first time visit, this only took 45 minutes which was less than I was expecting.Dr. Bauer and the staff are great and I hope when and if I need anything more serious I can prove them right even further as to how good they are. Hopefully that's not the case but I can already tell they will be awesome.

"Dr Shayna Mansfield has been my primary care physician since I moved to the valley. She has been outstanding as a doctor and very thorough in her approach with your health. During several visits she asked me a multitude of questions, as well as allowed me to be very open about what was going on. She even said at one point ""I don't know, how do you feel you would like to go about it"". Humility is amazing, and I am grateful I can have a conversation with her rather than being steamrolled like most other doctors who carry the ""treat 'em and street 'em"" mentality. As for he office, there was a little confusion with co pays with the office staff but no big deal. Bear in mind they are transitioning to emr so there is a little lag. They accept blue cross blue shield so most things are covered. Waiting room is clean, updated magazines fill most end tables. Parking is easy (I always get lucky with a front row spot). If you are looking for a great doctor, then you should defiantly trust dr Mansfield to give you the care you deserve.

"Dr. Riley is such a nice change from my previous experiences with doctors.  He is attentive, takes his time to listen, and even follows up with me, personally, to see how I am doing.  When I went in to see him for mild chest pain, which I believed to be heartburn, he insisted that I be evaluated by a cardiologist the next day.  After failing my stress test at the cardiologist's office due to a nearly 100% blockage of the main artery to my heart, I was immediately sent to the hospital for emergency surgery.  Because of Dr. Riley's serious approach to my symptoms and his staff's hard work at getting me into see a cardiologist as soon as possible, I truly believe that I avoided a major heart attack or worse.  I cannot thank him enough.  In addition to being my trusted personal physician, he was also my elderly parents' physician.  He and his staff were always kind, supportive and respectful to them.  It seems difficult to find doctors today who genuinely show care and concern for patients both in the way that they treat them medically, as well as personally.  I have been fortunate to find that in Dr. Riley.

"Finding a Family Doctor can be difficult and I have been having a rough time doing so since my former Doctor retired recently.  The requirements I had were...1.  MD2.  Office with one or two doctors...I hate when there are a bunch of people in the waiting room( especially gross sick ones ugh!).3.  Friendly, staff that actually returns calls!4.  Doctor that doesn't make you feel rushed and listens to your issues!5.  Easy to access, not in a big building that is hard to park in.6.  Available appointments.Dr. Riley is all these things and more.  I'm  really happy with the ease and the great medical care.  His nurses are good with needles as well.  I had to get my blood taken and a few shots and she performed like a pro with confidence!So, if you are in need of a new Doctor I highly recommend Dr. Riley.  I think they also take most insurances as well!
",1
"Dr. Riley has been my doc for 6 or 7 years now.  When I first went to his office, I was confused.  There weren't a ton of people in the waiting room.  I didn't have to wait one hour in the waiting room and another hour in the room.  As soon as Dr. Riley walked in, I started my ""speed-recitation of current symptoms"" - (this because my previous MD actually would look at his watch and note the time - and then do it again at the end of the ""consult"") - Dr. Riley listened calmly.  I was confused again, when he didn't just tell me I could pick up my prescription at the counter on my way out.  He actually TALKED with me.  He asked questions.  He didn't make a mad dash for the door!  Miraculous!!  And the good news is that this has not changed in all these years.  I don't have insurance, so Dr. Riley works with me on that.  He and his wife, the staff, everyone is great in this little gem of an office.  Dr. Riley is a real FAMILY doctor - he is always there for you.  What more could you possibly ask for
",1
"Dr. Riley is very down to earth person who just happens to be really smart and have a medical degree.  I'm usually pretty freaked out by doctors, medical offices, etc. but I don't feel that way with Dr. Riley - he is very calm and a good listener.  His office is small and you can usually get an appointment the same day or next.
",1
"Dr. Riley is great. I've only met with him twice, but have found each appt. very pleasant. He's welcoming and easy to communicate with.In addition, the ladies facilitating his office are kind and friendly; and have been very helpful during my past two visits.

"I have been going to DR. Riley for a couple years and I would recommend him to anyone that wants a doctor that is very handles on. He is always the one that sees you unlike some offices that have PA ect. he always takes time to call me about my lab results. I have always had great service and experience

"Hello, I have been going to Dr Riley for almost a year. I moved, Got new insurance and needed a new Dr that was close. As a new patient I was nervous, how ever when I got there the front office ladies were very friendly and the Dr spent about 30 min with me. I had lots of questions and concerns about my health ( it had been sometime since I had seen a doc). I'm approaching 38 and preventive maintenance is now important. I found Dr Riley on YELP, I found all of the reviews helpful. Thank You To Dr Riley and all the staff at Biltmore healthcare!!!

"Been seeing Dr Riley for years. He recently moved to Banner Healthcare. I like him. He has called me at home a couple of times to check on me. I was pretty ill but how often have you had that happen!  He is a great doctor and a compassionate human being. And he loves fly fishing!

"I love, love, love this place.  I switched from a previous office where the place always seemed to be a three ring circus.  Working together with Dr Oclair and Kate Montgomery, feels like a team.  This place is a well oiled machine!  My most recent visit with Kate Montgomery was to go over some maintenance medication concerns over health conditions she had more familariaty with, and the fact that I wanted to change, and what our next steps were.  We agreed on a change, but would do it by making sure we had the information needed to make sure the proposed choice was a good one with some additional blood tests.  She knew about the medication I wanted to switch to and provided me with well rounded information.  Unlike previous practices, this office is not change adverse, and after I explained why I wanted to change, felt we were on the same page.  This is easier said then done with most practices.  The office is a bit of a drive for me in the mornings 45 minutes which is longer than I like, but with the service received, it is so worth it.  Also unlike my previous provider, when receiving maintenance medications they provide at least 1 or 2 refills that way I'm not there additional times just to collect additional co-pays.  I feel like an empowered patient, Thanks Dr Oclair and Kate Montgomery.

"I was referred to FPS by an emergency-care physician for an MCL injury I suffered in a fall. I was seen by Dr, Francyk who immediately went to work. After an MRI and other tests, Dr. Francyk refereed me to Endurance Rehab in Phoenix. The rest is history. I've seen Dr. Francyk and his nurse Sara for more than a year now for wellness, blood pressure and cholesterol issues. The doctor and everyone at FPS has been caring, helpful and have gone the extra mile to see that I'm well taken care of.

"Dr. Wyse is one of the most caring doctors I have ever had.  He takes the time to listen vs. just writing on a notepad.  Dr. Wyse follows up with you very quickly and actually cares.

"I manage an Urgent Care down the street and refer patients to this office frequently. Especially the new patients in town that have had the same doctor where they came from for 15 years and are looking for a new, well rounded practice and knowledgeable team of doctors that they can trust.  I call to get feedback from them about their experience, just like I do when I refer patients to a certain Orthopedic, Urologist, ENT, Imaging Center ect.....  and all the responses I get are all pleasant,  They like the idea of having x-ray and lab services on site, unlike most PCP offices in the valley that have to send their patients to a different location to receive those services. I have not been there myself so I cant give you a personal account, but from the feedback that I get I never have any reservation in recommending Dr. Wyse and his team of doctors and staff to any patient looking for a new PCP that doesn't treat you like a number and takes hisher time to address all your concerns.

"Did new signgraphic install here and the people were very friendly and accessible. The office was busy the day we were there for this install, which shows me they have a very thriving practice. Good to know, in case I ever have to refer someone to a new doctor's office. This one is in a nice businessmedicalprofessional park.

"This is my all time favorite family practice - I have had terrible experiences in other practices, but Sobel Family Medicine will be my last stop. Super friendly staff and excellent PAs. You truly don't need to go anywhere else for your medical care. They are available and accommodating to sick kids (and sick adults!). They have always worked me in for same day appointments. They have two physicians, Dr. Bruce Sobel and Dr. Larry Sobel, two brothers specializing in family practice. They also have an on staff physical therapist, Audrey Sobel. Recently a third brother joined, Dr. Jerry Sobel. He specializes in treatment and rehabilitation of disorders of the muscle, nerves, and joints. He is a board certified Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation doctor. Dr. Jerry Sobel is very caring and direct with his patients, he was very concerned about my long term prognosis and did not just throw pills at me. Basically, the docs here care about the whole health of their patients and recommend all kinds of information on healthy living. It is not a patient mill and I was very happy with the level of care.

"I have been coming to this practice for years. It is a true family practice, however, they are progressive and they do everything in-house, they have their own x-rays, labs, chiropractor and physical therapy. I have used almost all of their services without any complaints. They are thorough and take the time to discuss all your needs. I personal use Dr. Becky, the PA, but I have also seen Bruce.

"I have been going to Dr Fauer for about 5 years now and I think he's great!  He takes the time to actually talk to you about what's going on. He doesn't rush in and do a 2 minute assessment.

"Dr. Fauer is in my lifetime - the best doctor I have had.  I've NEVER felt rushed or insignificant.  This is the doctor that you want in your corner when something is wrong because he is like a Sherlock Holmes - he doesn't leave a stone unturned and is extremely thorough.  He is very down to earth.  I walk out feeling like I saw a doctor that ""practices"" exceptionally.  His staff follows up in a timely manor with results as needed.

"I found exactly what I needed in a Dr. here. I had been a patient here for years before recently moving to Oregon. I saw Dr. Rebecca Morin and P.A. Maura Tardis. They both were extremely caring and had the BEST bedside manner. I truly felt that they listened to me and wanted to do what was in my best interest, regardless of the reason for my visit. Maura is one of the sweetest, funniest, and talented women you will ever meet. The gals in the office are just as great! They could always get me in no matter how quick the notice was. I will really miss this practice now that I am out of state.

"This is my local ""home"" gym.  Great routes, that are changed frequently, challenging lead routes and a large bouldering area. The staff is very friendly, always around for questions and safety Nazi's, which is good since they are always on top of the scary newbie belayer's. Members only nights are Tuesday and Thursday. This can be a very crowded time, is it because the men can climb shirtless Hmmm... The weekend can also be a crowded time due to the many kids birthday parties they hold there. But with as many routes as they have, finding a good route is no prob. The gym also has a decent fitness area with personal trainers and even offer free yoga nights to its members! Lots of great members perks in fact....All in all I love this gym. The only thing I think they could improve upon is offering more classes. Especially lead climb classes. Maybe some clinics too.Rock on!
",1
"I came here as a beginner, and was a member for almost a year until I moved farther south.  The staff was very helpful, both at the front desk and out on the floor.  Someone was always walking around, and if they saw you were on a route and having trouble with your next move they would offer technique tips to help.  They are also around for safety, and are quick to correct anyone not being safe....which I liked as a beginner and learner.  The routes are a good mix for beginnners to advanced climbers, and they have a bouldering area as well.  Member's nights are great, as you don't have as many beginners and it's fun to watch the really good climbers in action.  It can get busy on weekends with birthday parties and teenagers running around, but I knew those times and tried to avoid them.  Equipment is available to rent, including shoes, and they also have a little shop with some items for sale.  I like how they've added some yoga and other classes, and have a weight room and some treadmills upstairs to use.  A great place!

"I like to climb things I've learned.  This place is a tad bit far me, but totally worth the drive.  Looks fun - is fun, looks hard - is hard :) I know you're not supposed to use your arms much while climbing, but damn when you're up that high you can't help but be a little afraid of falling.  Thus, clinching for dear life!  Needless to say my arms are sore :( This would be a great family gathering, but also if you're looking for a good workout with a twist - it's a must!  Thumbs way up!

"AZ On The Rocks is an awesome place. I went about a month ago and had a blast! The people there are so friendly and helpful. I cant wait to go back with my friends! Loved it! =)
",1
"I have been to this gym twice now and I am really starting to get into climbing. I love their high ball bouldering problems, and the super high walls for top rope. Another thing that makes AZonR a great place to climb is because you can also do a solid work out afterwards with a full gym on the second floor. I can be a little crowded in the summer time but I guess that's to be expected.
",1
"The 2 reasons I originally went to AZR were 1.) My hubby (bf  the time) was way into climbing, so we started climbing together and 2.) One of my good friends works there (idk if he still does, but he worked there FOREVER).  I was immediately hooked on climbing! AZR is a great place for kid parties and team building (they probably have at least one kid birthday party every weekend).  They have plenty of bouldering and trad routes for people of all skill levels. They even have lead climbing (and classes to teach you lead climbing if you don't know how...which I don't haha).  The staff is super cool here, and we got on a first name basis with them. They are always friendly and helpful (and fun to hang out with, lol).  I also loved the free yoga classes for gym members with Jeanette.  I miss this place so much after moving away.
",1
"I hadn't been to the climbing gym in years and it was time to start back.  Went on Saturday and had a blast; varied routes, fun bouldering, helpful staff and a few automatic belays in case your partner wants to check something else out while you go up a route.  Seriously considering purchasing a membership.  My forearms are still sore.

"I am incredibly impressed with this place and I will go out of my way to go to Phoenix when the rock climbing bug hits!I've been climbing a couple of times, but only belaying my kids. This time I jumped in as a climber for a few reasons: 1. my awesome GTS workouts prepared me strength wise. 2. They have several auto-belays, so both my kids and I could climb individually. 3. For an indoor climbing gym, it's CHEAP!!!We hardly ever go to Rocks and Ropes in Tucson because it's so pricey. Not only do you have to pay the entry fee, but the equipment rental is separate. So for a family of 4, you're breaking the bank. Not that way at AZ on the Rocks. They have a special for a family of 4. $45 plus tax. That's it! No equipment rental fees AND it's all day! What a deal!!  We ended up spending about 4 or 5 hours there and had an absolute blast.Their registration and safety intro procedures are simple, well done and easy to understand. The staff is really on the ball when it comes to scanning the gym and the climbers to make sure everyone is doing it right. There are a multitude of climbing levels and walls, as well as a large bouldering area.On the second level they have an entire gym with treadmills, elliptical machines and free weights that you're more than welcome to use. Along with all that, they offer yoga classes and more.I cannot wait to get back to AZ on the Rocks! Thank you for making my first climbing experience an A+. I'm officially addicted!

"Nice place to go climbing. For first timers there's a mandatory video - not too bad, fairly short. As a first timer, they were friendly and patient with teaching all the basics. Nice staff, and nice rocks. Good times. Free climb on your birthday. Good stuff.

"Great climbing gym!!  Many routes of all difficulties and a variety of auto-belay routes for people like me who show up without climbing buddies.  Would highly recommend.

"On our trip to Phoenix, my daughter wanted to go rock climbing.  After researching, we headed over to Peoria and went Ape.Apart from the facilities, which were great, I really noted how helpful the staff was here.  With their help and advice (and not to mention great instruction on how to belay) my wife and I were able to encourage our daughter to make it all the way to the top of the climbing face.  It was a great, fun experience for all of us.Yes, we will be returning here on our next trip to Phoenix.  It's a great place for beginners to learn how to climb.
",1
"My first rock climbing experience was at Ape Index.  The staff was really helpful and made sure I was comfortable before I was sent off to start climbing.  The gym had lots of different routes.  I was able to go up a bunch of different routes and challenge myself.  After going to another rock climbing gym, I really appreciated how many different routes they had for beginners (that were not so simple that I felt like it wasn't worth my time) and for the advanced.
",1
"We had a blast rock climbing here. My 11 year old son had so much fun that he asked to return for a few more climbs after dinner.  We had an all-day pass, so why not We'll be back the next time we visit family in the area.
",1
"AMAZING! The staff was super helpful on my first trip out and I wound up climbing for 4 hours that night. I may not invest in a full-blown membership yet (climbing for one day had me sore for a week!) but I'll definitely swing by on Ladies' night (Wednesday) for half-priced climbing.
",1
"This is the only Rock Climbing gym I've been to so my review might be a bit biased.  The gym itself is very nice.  A bunch of walls with all kinds of paths to take.  I usually grab on to whatever rock I can reach.  The next time I go I will try sticking to paths.  They recently created a bouldering wall on the second level but that is only available to members.  They do have a small bouldering section in the back corner that is available to everyone.  A lot of the walls climbs require two people.  One person that is climbing and the other is belaying.  If you go in by yourself, you're kind of limited to the auto-belay climbs (I believe there are 4) and the bouldering section.  The overall price for rental and day pass is around $17-20.  If you do plan on going there more than twice in a month, I highly suggest you sign up for their membership which is $35 and you can go as many times you want through out the month.  Plus you get access to the upstairs bouldering room.
",1
"This place is the best gym in phoenix area. A lot of great nice climbers willing to help you figure out routes or belay you...more fun to climb with a friend unless you boulder! The staff is great! I got a membership first day and plan to keep it up as a regular sport. Bouldering is a little difficult for beginners but you get better faster! ask for some help and you'll be on your way!
",1
"This place is awesome! For me, it's about human interaction and the staff there are VERY nice and helpful... the guy that helped us seemed very excited to be there and his attitude was contagious. Everyone there is relaxed and knowledgeable. The walls provide a lot of options for beginners like my group. Safety is also important, they train and go over things before you go to the wall.
",1
"Ape Index has heart and soul.  It is a community of people who are so encouraging and supportive.  The routes change constantly, so that there are always new things to try, in fact I would say about 25% of the gym has changed since January.  There are some signs up that say prices will be raised starting in April so it is my suggestion that you try to check it out before then.  There are ways to get ""locked in"" to the old price if you like it there.    Climbing in general has really changed my life a lot.  It has giving me a place with positive influences to blow off steam after a really hard day.  Not that I was going to the pub a lot but it has kind of replaced the pub for me.  I do hope over time a few more auto belays are added, otherwise it is perfect.
",1
"This place is really awesome. No other gym in the valley has such a welcoming atmosphere and both the staff and the regulars are extremely friendly, helpful and supportive! The routes are constantly changing and evolving and I feel like theres always something new, fun, and challenging to test myself on! This is the place to be  to develop personal growth and you'll always have a sincere group of people to help you on your path. It earns my highest recommendation!

"This was the most educational and fun activity on our trip to Arizona. Our guide, Caleb, was incredibly knowledgeable about all things climbing. We will use them every time we visit Arizona, or their other  locations, when traveling! We laughed, climbed and learned a lot! At one point I became a little overwhelmed with the height and Caleb safely, quickly verbally guided me down to where they were waiting at the bottom. An amazing, kind and very cost effective company!

"I have always wanted to try rock climbing and finally had the opportunity w Stoneman. Had an absolutely great time with my instructor Todd. He had all the gear & was a great instructor. I would highly recommend contacting them if you're interested in getting out there. 5 stars all the way

"My husband and I just got into rock climbing and were thrilled at the opportunity to try it for a second time in AZ! Caleb was an awesome guide and went beyond the two hour time we signed up for because he was willing to show us new types of climbs while explaining the technical skills and techniques as we went along. Now my husband is hooked on ""crack"" climbing! All of the gear was provided and we enjoyed spending the morning with Caleb. We'll definitely be coming back to climb with him the next time we are in the area.

"My family and I were visiting AZ over the holidays and love to do group activities. I called up Caleb and he helped us set up a group trip for 9 of us. He and Hugo showed up with all the equipment we needed and were excellent teachers. Our group ranged in age and skill level and they adapted to our needs. Ontop of that, they were a lot of fun and our group had a great time with them! I would recommend them to anyone - very knowledgeable, affordable and you feel you are in good hands with them!

"Clean gym, friendly atmosphere, great routes  problems!I stopped by for a climb while on vacation and I couldn't be happier with the decision. Here are some reasons why you should climb here:Problems  Walls: Beginner - Expert throughout the gym...most gyms reserve the overhangs and slanted walls for more difficult problems, but Refuge has bigger holds throughout the gym so you can still have fun on seemingly difficult problems at only a v2-v3 level.Staff:Justin gave me some beta on a few routes that I would have never figured out and the owner Jeff actually worked one-on-one with me providing advice on climbing technique. The two tremendously helped me advance the way I approach a problem.Gym:In addition to clean holds and new mats, Refuge also has clean bathrooms, water fountains, cubbies, couches, changing rooms, lockers, yoga room, and a complete traditional gym - they have it all.Final Word: I wish this gym was in my neighborhood, my local gym doesn't chalk up! (duh-duhn--tshh)

"When I first heard there was going to be a new bouldering gym in Las Vegas, my initial thoughts were ""cool....not going to be a good place to train, maybe check it out when it rains and the sandstone is soaked.""Then I came into the refuge and my mind was thoroughly changed.To call this place a climbing gym is to use a misnomer, it truly is a training facility.  The  offerings of fitness and yoga incorporated with VERY good route setting really helps push this place to what Las Vegas has long needed.Within a week of opening, the number of local hardmen and hardwomen I have seen frequenting this place reinforced what I had already suspected:  This place is awesome.It has a very open feel to it, the walls are quite tall and downclimbing is an essential skill here if you value your kneesankles.  Staff is fantastic as noted above, and most of the time they are wearing staff shirts.  Most climbing gyms I have been to I haven't been able to tolerate the 'bro' mentality and condescension many of the staff members have, that is absent here.I agree that it is a bummer that vending machines are the only fooddrink options other than water here, also would be nice if they sold a few things like chalk and tape...but that is truly nit picking.The owner is very active in the gym as is his manager, and both are very receptive to and often solicit feedback.  Now if only I could get stronger so I could climb some of those V-Thatisreallyfreakinghard problems...

"We found this through Groupon. It is an awesome brand new place to climb. It's clean and the staff is very nice and helpful. It's mainly bouldering which is a technique of climbing without ropes. They do have one wall that you can use ropes, but this is mainly used for birthday party's so if you want to use ropes you should call ahead. There is also a small place to stretch and work out before you start. If you just want to sit and watch they have 2 huge couches that you can relax on.

"Loved it!I know NOTHING about go karting, cars, engines but my boyfriend who loves stuff like that brought me here for date night. We came around 10:45pm on Friday night. They had a running special so the boyfriend paid full price and my cost of entry was only $5. The workers were EXTREMELY helpful. Since we came so late, we were the only people there (excluding the group at the food area) so we had the track for ourselves. One thing I really like is that you sign up and register upon entry and they automatically send you your race times and place number to your email along with giving you a print out. I had the best date night ever coming here.

"A colleague and I are traveling across the states working for a rock n roll touring act and we have been going to many karting courses. Victory lane is by far our most favorite. We make it a priority to come here every time we are near Charlotte.  The course is awesome and the karts are insanely fast. These are GAS powered, not electric. So much better. The staff is incredibly knowledgable and their kitchen made us specialty food items. We had such an awesome experience here and we will DEFINITELY be back soon. If we lived nearby, we'd be here multiple nights a week.

"Went with some work friends on business. Great time!It's nice to smell the fumes and rubber and to race with a real engine. I've raced at k1 speed and it doesn't beat the gas engines and the price of this place (maybe 10 bucks cheaper per race on avg). The jumpsuits and track size and config combined with the above make a great experience for adults.I also like their idea of membership if you wanna get competitive or come more often. Didn't seem the same at k1 when I went back home.Highly recommended!

"Met the owner during a wakeboard session down in Charlotte this past weekend and with the rain that came in Sunday, decided it was a perfect chance to go check out his establishment until the weather cleared up a bit.5 stars.Employees were on top of things, pricing was right on the money (Buy 2 races, get 1 free) and the carts were fast enough for the track layout to keep things interesting.  Tons of fun, and I would definitely be in a league or similar if I was a local.I've been to a few other indoor karting facilities across the country, and Victory Lane is at the top of the food chain!

"VLK is a great place for rental karting. The staff is typically pleasant and friendly to deal with. With the recent addition of a new fleet of karts, things are top notch.Keep up to date with the website and they always have leagues running, as well as 12 and 24 hour special events.You bring the money, they provide the helmet, firesuit and kart and along comes the entertainment!Recently along came the introduction of Pit Road Bar & Grill! They have a vast variety of legendary bar food and cold flowing adult beverages. Most of the barkeeps are friendly and easy to deal with.

"Went here for a company event. Everyone had a great time. The staff was on point & had fun personalities. The bar was great & the bartenders were awesome! I liked that if your not into racing go karts there are games such as corn hole, foosball, and ping pong. There are huge glass windows so that you can sit anywhere inside and watch the races.

"Everyone loves fun! At F1 Race Factory, fun is their focus. Safety is their MO. I came here in the fall of '06 for a work function. It was a team-building day, so while we did have to meet in a room and ""talk shop,"" the people at F1 made it very comfortable and easy. We met in their big room (with couches, high tables and ample space) for our meetings. Breaks were then infused with team fun. We actually got to split into groups and challenge each other - see who could be the fastest team to change 4 tires on a real (thought retired) race car. My team placed 2nd. It was great! We got to do a practice run, and then two real runs to let our lowest time qualify. F1 was sure to have snacks and beverages handy after (and before) in case we worked up an appetite during the day. Lunch was served here, too. Tasty hamburgers made to order. After our meetings, we got to go on the track. Beforehand, we sat through a brief safety video and explanation. Then we were fitted for helmets and shown to where the action happens. I was nervous. I had never driven a go-kart before, and these were suppose to be the fastest in-door go-karts in Arizona. Uhm, yeah. Let's just say I had no idea what I was doing. Nobody explained the pedals to me, so I just assumed they ran like a car. I was right. I took off, not really knowing how many laps I had to do or where I was going. There were friendly guys out on the track to wave flags - for ""wreck"" ahead, slow down or even get out of the way of speed-devils behind ya. (I got the latter quite a bit.) At the very last of the race, somebody sped by me to place ahead of me. That means I placed last. That's okay. It was my first time out there, and while I spun my car around once or twice - and ran into the sides several times - I was just happy to be alive! To make the race fun, F1 gave us awards for 1st, 2nd and 3rd. I won an award, too - for being the turtle on the track. That was funny. All in all, I had a great time. While I would probably not go to back to race, I'd go back to watch people race or hang out in the ""cafeteria"" area, playing arcade games or munching on food. This is DEFINITIVELY  a fun place to send your thrill-seeking, speed junkie friends. You can get gift cards, too!

"Had a blast at this spot ( and not just because i whooped my bf's ass either on the track..bhahaha)anywho, we signed up and became members cheaper to do it that way if you think you will get the urge to race often. Member is $14 and some change and non member is $20. You sign up, pick a racing name that will permanently been yours forever and eva.. ( Sexyspeeder, right here :) ) you get a head sock you will have to wear under the Helmet, free t-shirt if you sign up also.  LADIES wear closed toe shoes... i had to borrow some of there's and lets just say i never want to wear rental shoes again.You can race as much as you want, take breaks in between or do back to back if you choose. On Sundays they combine the tracks together so its an even longer track. it was really fun, those little karts go pretty fast ( and they do take bumping very seriously..they will pull your grown ass over and scold you like a little kid if they catch you..i know cause they gave my bf a talkin too) they keep track of your best lap and which place you came in and you get a paper that records all this... my 1 is plastered on the refrigerator! whoop whoop.If your looking for some competitive fun, try this place out. They also have food, drinks, rock wall, and arcade also. Also might be a cool spot to throw a kids b-day party also!vroom-vroom!

"awesome! had a groupon with some work buddies. we went on a weeknight...much better option as during our 3 races, there were only maybe 5 total racers, which lends itself to way more ""going fast!"". i'm sure it gets a heckuva lot busier on the weekends. i'm glad we had the groupon for the 3 races because the normal pricing seemed a bit steep. but it's all glammed out for the nascar in all of us. you watch a short video, donn a head sock and helmet and out you go. the carts are super fast (much faster than the rinky-dink ones we had as a kid). braking and sliding is just so much fun. remember though...it's not bumber cars! they will flag and remove you from the course if you blatantly or continually bump other drivers. because it does hurt....i got t-boned by one of my work buddies and my back was sore for a week afterwards. they serve beer and some basic bar food. there's a small game room (think 80's arcade) and the staff, although didn't seem to be too enthralled about being at work, were helpful. we have several more groupons for this place and can't wait to go back!

"This place puts a smile on my face...ear to ear, baby!!  So much fun! I knew about this place for awhile, I remember hearing Carl Edwards talk about it on the radio one time, years ago. With my brother and dad visiting from out-of-state about three weeks ago, I suggested we check it out. What a great decision. F1 is not your typical go-kart amusement park let's take a couple of spins around the track and be on our way. It is probably that x100. I'm pretty sure the karts got up to 30-35mph. The slipping and sliding, and constant fishtailing makes for a kick ass ride.  Seriously, it's a great time. You won't be disappointed.  The only negative I could understand people having is that the prices are kind of steep. I would recommend to check out the website, which often include coupons and other offers and memberships.  (Also, check the website for their calendar of events. They do have different track options for different days, and they do have league races which could cause conflict.) Me personally, don't mind paying the money for this type of entertainment, it was a blast! Brought me back to my teenage days, I will definitely check out F1 again!

"I attended the 4-Day Racing School and ""Loved it""!!!For ""anyone"" that wants to learn the limits of ""any car"" in ""any situation"", the Bondurant courses will teach you what you need to learn.Before I attended Bondurant I had experience racing cars, however, hands down...if you, your family member (who mabie a panicky driver), teenage driver...anyone would benefit from the courses at Bondurant...even the Intro. to Racing.The instructors I found to be very helpful and I got the feeling that any of them would be confident teaching 'anyone' how to drive and how to handle a car...in which heshe can then translate the skills learned to any car on the road.It has been about 6 years since I completed the course and it is still memorable for me...and will definitely go back when I have the money to race again.        Thank you Bondurant for having a wonderful school with positive, knowledgable and helpful instructors.

"I highly recommend taking this course. It may be expensive, but it's hard to put a price on driving skills that could save your life or the lives of your friendsfamilies. For how much time we all spend in cars, it sure doesn't hurt to have superior command of your vehicle.I learned a lot in my course. For example, I learned about weighting the individual tires of my car, particularly through a turn. I also got experience steering out of a ""black spin."" Sure the odds of getting into a situation like this are low, but I like to think that I will remain calm and return my vehicle to safety should I ever find myself in this position. Also, it's fun! I still think of Bondurant skills today -- years after taking the course -- and hope that I can do the program again in another 10 years or so. Highly recommend!!

"Training at Bondurant is not a goof-off, play-time joke. There is serious classroom time to learn serious theory, early starts, long days and thorough testing.I have done other high performance  advanced driving courses before. But this was by far the most technical and demanding.I did a 4 day course which I think cost about $5000 (someone else paid). Based on what I can do in a car now, that feels like a bargain. The most valuable improvement in my driving is a much more heightened awareness of vehicle dynamics. I can ""feel"" the weight distribution of my vehicle change now as I change speed and direction. After driving the Bondurant vehicles, mine feels like a boat, but I can drive it a lot better. And if I ever have to do a reverse 180 at 40 miles an hour, no problem. Also you meet really cool people in the course.

"My husband was able to go here for an experience.  He absolutely loved it.  I hung out on the sideslines and watched him have a great time.  It made me nervous how fast he was going, and he was even having a hard time catching his equalibrium when he was finished.  He'd go back again in a heart beat!

"I took the 4-day Grand Prix Road Racing course and, really, the best way to put phrase this is ""You don't know what you don't know.""  I thought I knew what I was doing, but I really didn't.  However, I didn't know that!  They broke me down and built me back up with all of the correct methods.  I can't say enough for the program and the instructors.If you have questions as to how good they actually are, go to the corvette forums and ready the reviews that people have given them, from real Corvette owners and aficionados.I WILL BE BACK!

"I was lucky enough to come here with a large group of friends and family members to race Corvettes and go-karts. I have loved Corvettes for a long time and this was the first time I got to actually ride in one, but HELLO I got to drive it, as well! What an experience! I felt like Danica Patrick. The go-karts were a little more scary, but maybe I just had too much competition. Yea that's it! I was one of two girls and there were like 10 guys with us. But it seriously was such a fun day. If you get a chance to go, don't hesitate! Hit the gas pedal and go!

"Billy N's review covers the details very well for the 4 Day Grand Prix course, so I won't retype them. One thing I will add is that the drills in the first two days are applicable to both the rest of the course and street driving so, they are definitely worth the time spent on them.From my experience with the heat on the track, don't hesitate to take a break when you need one, there is plenty of seat time in the course!From the moment you walk in until the moment you leave, everyone is professional and relaxed to make sure you have a good time and learn all you can.  Thanks to Brennan, Instructors William and Robert, Marissa at the desk, and of course Bob Bondurant for executing a great week for me and the rest of our class!

"Bondurant School of High Performance Driving - 5 Stars: While it has been some time since I was here, I felt it really deserved a review. This was a great experience. I worked at a company where we tried to have something special to do each year with the senior people - sort of a team building project that could also be lots of fun ... we chose Bondurant Racing School one year. While programs and cars change at the Bondurant School from time to time, when we went it was all Ford and we took the 2-Day Grand Prix Specialty course. Our introduction was the same as others have mentioned...we arrived at the 15-turn track and the first thing the instructor does after saving hello is put us in an unassuming 15-seat passenger van to drive around the track and see what we would be learning for the two days...or so he said. We put on our seatbelts and then he drove us around pretty fast...sloshing us from side to side on the seats (memo to file - don't spend the previous night getting loaded in celebration for the first day because you will need all your senses)...and then he drove it again at his top end to show us how fast one can drive if they are in control ... what a great intro to the course. Now we had our challenge for the two day event. We spent a half-day in the classroom learning the physics of high performance driving - where to enter a turn...when to brake...when to get off and on the accelerator...the handling differences between front-wheel drive cars and rear-wheel drive machines. Then it was out to the skid track to feel the physics - the instructor used the outriders (lifters) on a car to lift different corners at high speed - the challenge was to see how fast you could do circles or figure-eights before losing control. We did this together and then one by one with the instructor - so we had a lot of personal one-on-one time (memo to file - Dramamine).  After that we went to a slalom course where it started as a single lane and split into a Y - each one controlled with a stop light. At the start of the course we were invited to see how much wheel spin we could generate on starting - in fact they egged us on and, of course, with high performance tires on it was hard to get much spin...but it did get our speed up for this lesson on the Y strip. The challenge here was to approach the lights as fast as possible and slam on the brakes at a marked point, and steer the car into the lane with the green light - which did not appear until the last second. The lesson was that you can steer a car even when in a full ABS brake lockup...something you really don't know until you try it. End of day one.Day two was mostly on the 15-turn road course. We strapped on our cars and went out one by one with the instructor again - for a little personal time the first time around the course. After each had done this, we each had the chance to have the course to ourselves and see how fast we could get around with no competition. After that our group was given access to race each other (you can buy insurance to pay for any damage you cause). We had been given the course rules beforehand so racing against each other was a lot of fun and not dangerous. This was probably the most fun - the chance to put into practice all we had learned so far. We ended the day with the opportunity to drive open-wheeled cars on the skills track, and then on the road course. The difference between the two types of race cars was amazing, and fun to try. Getting in the open-wheeled cars is a bit claustrophobic inasmuch as you wear a helmet with facemask in this equipment and the cockpit is a tight fit. The Bondurant School is expensive (from $500 to $5,000 per person depending on lessons and days) but tons of fun. It is a great event to do with a group. Just make sure you like the smell of oil and exhaust and spinning tiresburning rubber - this is a racing enterprise and all the smells you'll run into constantly remind you of it. But it was a singular experience to be able to rip the tires off a car and drive all out. Great lessons in safety, and how to drive fast and safely.

"I took the 4 day Grand Prix Racing program. Excellent, serious racing preparation. Race theory and car control are taught in the classroom and drilled into you on the track. You perform repetitive exercises to learn heeltoe sifting, emergency race avoidance maneuvers and apex exercises. Official races were held between our group where we had to react correctly to the flags thrown. The instructors are racers and very good, they rate your performance daily. 80% of my time was spent on the track in the car, LOT'S of seat time.A couple guys brought their personal rides (Ferrari, Aston Martin) and worked a deal to take them on the track, awesome. I stayed at the fantastic Sheraton Wild Horse Pass Resort & Spa, right across the street from the racetrack.My driving skills increased dramatically and it was the best time I've ever had. Highly recommended

"I did the 2 day Grand Prix class, and while I wish there had been more time on track, the experience was awesome. The skills learned in all of the drills will stay with me forever, and that's what's important. The instructors are great - very patient, and don't rush you at all. They want you to improve your skills, and will not make you feel like an idiot if you don't get it right away.

"Off the strip is a great place for kids to put pedal to the metal.  One kart track for the little ones, two for older kids, and one for over 16.  Looks as if they hold a number of kids' b-day parties here but don't pay that no mind because the action is outdoors.  Look in the What's On mag (available for free in hotels) for a coupon worth 1 free ride if you buy 2.   You'll need a rental car to get here because it's about 15 minutes from the Strip.

"It was nice that this place was a venue that participated with the Las Vegas Power Pass.  Being on vacation I like finding deals that keep me on a budget especially with 2 children. The Power Pass included 2 ride tickets, 6 tokens, a personal sized 1 topping pizza and a small drink. Because we had multiple days on the Power Pass it resets at midnight and you can do it all over again.  My kids loved it so much that we went 2 nights in a row.  It saved me on dinner both nights since it came with food.  The pizza was pretty good, cheese was gooey and the crust wasn't soggy. The kids loved racing each other on the tracks and it lasted a while too.  Definitely coming here again on our next vacation.

"So I've lived in Las Vegas for about 10 years now and have been to the Las Vegas Mini Gran Prix a bunch of times. I enjoy taking my kids and out of town guests out to ride and play in the arcade. It's a fun place on weekends with the buzz from all the activity. I had some friends in town last weekend and they wanted to do something ""NON-Strip"" related as they had been doing all of the shows and attractions. I suggested the LVMGP and we had a blast. My friends loved the place and we landed up spending about 4 hours there just goofing around and acting like kids. They have an awesome automated Cotton Candy Machine that you have to try.I though we were going to be there for a an hour tops but we landed up being there until about dinner time. We worked up a bit of an appetite and after looking at the menu thought we'd give it a shot. Listen, Las Vegas Mini Gran Prix has an awesome menu! If there is a category for ""The tastiest, LEAST Greasy Pizza I've ever had I'd vote LVMGP tops. Their 16"" Large 1 topping pizza is killer and at only $4.99 with a text in deal...it's even more yummy. They have baked chicken wings and BBQ ribs that are out of this world. Tender, Juicy, Wow! Honestly I never expected such great quality to come from behind that counter. It's a hidden secret and I recommend it. It took me 10 years to finally taste their selection.If you want to have a great time, have some fun food and just act like a kid for a few hours Las Vegas Mini Gran Prix is a great way to go. I suggest using their text-in program as they have some good coupons. Text ""LVMGP"" to 62411 for updated weekly specials. You can also find them on-line at www.MobileCoupons.com

"We were looking for Go Karts in Las Vegas for our trip. Since we had our 2 young boys with us It was difficult to find a 2 seater Go Kart or one they can drive themselves. I was searching the internet and came upon this place! It was only 15 minutes away from the strip! Not bad at all! We went on a Wednesday early afternoon so it was totally empty. They have this cool little photobooth in the middle where you can take free pictures and post them on your facebook!They had go Karts especially for kids! My boys had a blast. Then all the way in the back they have the adult Go Karts which my husband and sister in law LOVED! It was so much fun they have other little rides as well!

"If you're looking for a fun, clean, well maintained entertainment center with arcade games, food, rides and four different racetrack course - this is it!  We had an awesome time with the Sprint cars, the go karts and the arcade games.

"Discover your inner-racer here. You get to suit up (optional) and wear a neckbrace and helmet (a must-do) and cause all kinds of havoc on this track, although bumping is not allowed. Bumping is for less-skilled drivers anyhow, you're just here to race and test your skills against competition and that just adds to the fun. You're timed, all the way down to your fastest and slowest laps and given a standings sheet after each race. It can be a bit tiring toward the end but it is a good workout and you'll wanna experience the adrenaline rush again. It was in all honesty--the best time I had in Vegas.

"Holy shit.  I really wasn't expecting much from this place based on their relatively simple track set up.  I went with four friends in the midst of a bachelor party and could not have had more fun.  My only other karting experiences have been at Speed Ring (now closed) and GoKartRacer.  The differences  1) Racing suits optional (ditched after the first session). It makes for less fatiguing racing AND you know who everyone else is INSTANTLY.  2) Superb ventilation.  Four humongous fans on one end of the track, four opposing roll up garage doors partially open.  3) Well-tuned vehicles.  Despite the huge and ungainly gas tanks in between the drivers' legs, the carts accelerated and handled flawlessly.  I'm sure the rear located engine helped with the fairly neutral handling   Although having driven 3 different cars, each car had their unique set of handling quirks.  4) BUMPING.  We weren't paranoid about getting kicked out after the initial bump.  In fact, when we proved that we knew what we were doing (we didn't bump anyone into an unrecoverable crash), they let us drive the last one unattendedunsupervised.You know you're having fun when you DON'T want to be the driver out in front....

"I had the greatest time at Fast Lap. The customer service here is excellent. Because we had a group of eight, a shuttle was conveniently sent to pick us up at our hotel. After filling out some waivers and watching a short instructional video, the fun really started. We got to wear racing suits. They're optional, but it's so much more fun to wear them and get in that racing spirit. Add your head sock, gloves, neck brace and helmet and you're ready to go racing. For $62 per person, we got three 15-lap heats. The first two were fast lap qualifying heats. The final heat was a full fledged race with a traditional 3-2-1 race start. The karts were by far the fastest I've driven at a place like this. It was such an adrenaline rush being out there, chasing down cars in front of you and trying to pass them. After each race, printouts are provided showing lap-by-lap times and other helpful racing stats. When we were all done, the shuttle had just arrived to take us back to our hotel. I cannot wait to go again.

"BOGO = $12.50 per person! No taxes no extra anything... since when can you get a whole race (10 minutes) for that price in the Bay Area Granted that it's Vegas and we went on a Monday, the track was basically empty except for another couple there. We watched a one minute rule of safety and had the option of putting on the jumpsuit. But seriously, who in their right minds would want to put on stinky jumpsuits which were worn and probably not washed on a consistent basis eitherThe track was simple, but fun enough where there were curves which prevented you from going too fast (well, for me at least). Maybe it's the off-strip of Vegas, but everything is cheaper than it is in the Bay Area!For those of you who are sick of the strip and the smoke and don't want to do anything that's ""typical Vegas"", but want to get your adrenaline pumping, this is the place to go!

"This is by far the best go-kart track in Vegas.  Gas powered karts - not electric ones like the other tracks - give you that real racing feel.  They are MUCH faster than the track, so you really have to drive.  You can't just floor it all the way around the course like at the kiddie cart tracks - this place is for adults who want to act like kids for a while, not snot-nosed toddlers.Staff is always helpful and friendly, track is perfect for all skill levels (not too easy or too difficult) and it's a great bang for your buck.  Just about anytime I have friends or family visiting me in Vegas and they ask to do something non-traditional (i.e. not gamble, get trashed, hit the strip clubs or spend hours throwing food down our throats at a buffet) I take them to Fast-Lap.  Not once has anyone I've taken not been thoroughly impressed and had a great time.  It's a blast - try it!

"I took my boyfriend here on a surprise date. He had no idea where we were going because the place is located on Paradise right before the road turns into a dead end. Once we turned into the parking lot he said, ""Fast Lap Oh my god, we're going to Fast Lap! My friends at work have been telling me about this place. This is awesome!""We walked in and were greeted by a woman at the front desk. We showed her our voucher for 2 races for 2 people and she had us each fill out a waiver (that's when you know things are about to get intense). Then she brought us to the back room where we had to watch a short video on safety precautions and Fast Lap rules. After we were finished with that, we put our belongings in a little locker and suited up in some kickass jumpsuits. I was pleasantly surprised to see they had one that wasn't ginormous on me, seeing as I am under 5ft. Once we were suited up, we went to the racing area, got on our helmets and gloves, and waited to be called up for our first race. There was no one else there at the time, so it was just Don and I that got called up. We were given neck collars for added protection and two carts were assigned to us. I was glad they didn't have me get into a junior sized cart, since I didn't reach the 60in. requirement for an adult sized cart (maybe they just assumed I wasn't that short), but they did have to put two pillows on my chair so I could reach the pedals! Once we took off on the lap, Don immediately zoomed off far ahead of me. I guess I'm too much of a paranoid driver to really race here, but I enjoyed going through all the twists and turns of the track, even though Don overlapped me like 3 times, literally. I didn't even keep track of how many times we went around the lap, but it seemed like it lasted 10 minutes or so. The second time we got on the track, there were about four other people racing as well. We all took off and I pretty much stayed 4th place the entire time. I didn't really enjoy the race with that many people as much as I did with just Don and I because I felt like I was at high risk for crashing into someone else, so I never really tried to pass anyone up. Don said he preferred the race with that many people though, because it was a challenge. I guess that tells you who's more ballsy between the two of us. All in all I LOVE this place. The staff is very accommodating and knowledgeable, the track is entertaining, the place is very clean, and the experience is exhilarating. I highly recommend you check this place out. There seems to be a lot of great deals for this place going on right now on different websites, so get them while they're still available because you won't be disappointed! They definitely accommodate your needs here

"862011This was my second visit to Fast Lap this year and they definitely did not disappoint!Pros:    Open late (until 11 pm) most of the week  Friendly staff  Quick carts   Cons:  Very hot (temperature hot).  Helmet visors need are all scratched    So I took my girlfriend's brother here for his birthday and it was super dead.  I was surprised considering it was a Saturday evening.  I could have sworn it was going to be packed (totally wrong... we were the only ones there).  I had purchased 2 races for each of us.  Since we were the only one there, the worker running the track gave us the option to do one 20 minute run or the typical two runs at 10 minutes a piece.  He recommended doing the 20 minute run as it would allow to master all the turns and give us a chance to conquer the track.  I figured that it was an awesome opportunity to do so and that's what we did.  He ended up beating the first half of the race, but I finished in first at the end.  Info & Tips:   If you have never been to Fast Lap, be prepared by bringing your driver's license and to fill out a waiver prior to starting.  The next step is watching a 2 minute safety video.  It's a little cheesy, but your attention is needed.  After doing so, I recommend you use the restroom if need be.  You don't want to suit up then have to use the restroom 2 minutes before race time!  I love dressing up.  I think it's part of the experience.  Suit up in your choice of red or black.  After going through the second set of doors, you have other safety gear to put on(not in this order ha):  Helmet, head sock, neck brace, and racing gloves (optional just like the race suit).    Don't forget to pick up your paper, which tracks your best time, fastest lap, top speed, etc. etc.  Keep it for bragging rights and take a picture with it on the podium (you'll see the podium).    Totally awesome.  More so if they had helmets with visors that weren't scratched.  If you have your own helmet, you may bring that one.  Don't forget to check out the photo wall in the office and see what celebs have raced the tracks of Fast Lap.  I'd most definitely recommend this place.  Even though it's family fun, I wouldn't recommend it for younger kids.  I could see how it could be dangerous...and don't think that you are too old to have fun at Fast Lap.  That's nonsense and a tell-tale sign that you are probably scared to put the petal to the metal!

"I love this place, even down to the cheesy race suits they make you wear.Ever wonder what it felt like to go 50mph around an indoor track and drift on a go kart Well then this is the place for you.I went with around 8pm on a Thursday night. There was a bachelor party there so there was about 10 of us on the track. But, it was a blast racing complete strangers! The staff here is wonderful, you have to watch a safety video and suit up in race suits, they also provide you with a neck brace and helmet. MUST TRY!

"This place has really fast karts... much faster than the one I did in Daytona 0_0! I got the groupon deal for 2 ppl, 3 races per person for $49!!! what a deal! had to wait about 1.5 hrs though because everyone was using their groupons...Before my race, I witnessed some kid crashing into the first sharp turn & he flew into the air & hit the pole... his helmet flew off & he fked up his kart. Damn.... that kid did not put on his helmet correctly & he accelerated instead of braking on the turn.. he also looked too tall for the kart.. he was pretty tall. After seeing that... I was always scared of the first turn... while all the other turns I was reckless.after my first race, my hands were numb! I was more reckless the first time... the second race, I rammed a guy [who then had problems wit his kart bc of me] & i started smelling gas so i was scared I'd blow up. This place is awesome except for the long wait. I'd def do this again!!!

"It's like most family fun places, but seems to have a lot more. It had miniature golf, batting cages, go karts, bumper boats, arcade games *and* sandbeach volleyball and a driving range. The best part The automatic tees that come up with your ball and the fact the balls load themselves. No more carrying around a bucket for the truly lazy ;) Overall it seemed pretty clean as well.

"Um...FUN!!! And affordable! Took my 4 year old nephew here, to ride the ""fast race cars"" and he loved it! The go cart track is fun as can be, and the 2 person go carts even had a second ""steering wheel"" that he could pretend to use (other go carts don't always have the second wheel, and he is very serious about steering). Anywhoo, we also did the bumper boats, and those were just as damn fun! Wait times in line were nil, and prices are cheap. I highly recommend this place! Can't wait to go again.

"I love CrackerJax, because it is super fun! I had a strong desire to go to some batting cages, because for some reason, I used to go a lot as a kid when I was living in AZ. Plus, why wouldn't you like it Or maybe I'm just weird. But, from not even handling a bat in almost 10 years, I wasn't half bad! I apparently was so good, that this little 5 yr old boy started watching me, called his Dad over to watch, told me how impressed he was, and then gave me a high five. Um awesome Definitely the highlight of the evening. It's kind of sad that I felt so happy about a little kid giving me a high five, but hey, it was pretty cool. We also decided to do the bumper boats, and the go karts. My bf got my Mom and her bf to do the go karts with us, which she wouldn't usually do. Super fun! I was scared to do it, since I haven't even driven a car in 6 years, but it was soooo much fun! We ended up doing it 4 more times.

"My family had an awesome afternoon riding the go-carts over and over with the four hour pass. But the best part was the staff, who helped us find our keys which we had lost in the go-carts. The manager Dawn Rae had her crew spend an hour searching the under carriage of 20 cars and eventually found our keys. She went above and beyond and saved us so much money & stress and salvaged our vacation.  Thank you!

"CrackerJax is great for kids; big and small.  My son and I started off in the Batting Cages where you have a range of cages to chose from: 35mph to 70mph.  We were visiting the area to attend SF Giants spring training so we used their bats and helmets.  Not the best equipment but did the job.  $1.50 for 18 balls is a great deal from where we are from so we had no complaints.  Next, we were off to the go-karts.  Another tremendous value.  They have armbands you can purchase for unlimited rides of the go-karts, bumper boats and mini-golf for $25 (weekends) but we settled on the $6.50 single ride ticket.  They give you about 10 minutes of unbridled go-kart fun.  The arcade does have older style arcade games but we didn't have any problems with the basketball game, skeeball, football game or the jump rope game that kept us busy for an hour until we left for lunch.  We didn't have time to walk over to the golf driving range otherwise we'd probably could have easily spent another hour or two at the facility.  They have something for everyone.

"My boyfriend and I came here on a Thursday night around 8:30 PM for a spur-of-the-moment date night and I couldn't have been more impressed. The prices were very reasonable, and the entire place was a lot of fun! We paid for the Unlimited Wristbands (which you can get a coupon for making them $15 ea) which gives you unlimited access to the bumper boats, mini golf, and racetrack for four hours. We were there for only 1.5 hours until the park closed and we made our money back x2 considering the prices for each of the attractions alone. We went around the racetrack I believe 5 or 6 times, played an entire 18 holes of mini golf, and went on the bumper boats. Overall, we had a great time and we will be back!

"WOW!!  Just moved to Las Vegas and I am a big racing fan.  In the past month I have visted three racetracks (Mini Grand Prix, Fast Lap and Pole Position).  The grand Prix is more of a kids place but fun if you are under 10.  Fast Lap was a dump, I could not even stand to stay and race as it felt like it was over 100 degrees in the building and the exhaust smell made me dizzy.   I also went to Pole Position which was very cool.  The cars are electric and the place is air conditioned so that alone made me stay.  i did go on a Saturday and they were very busy, I had to wait for 45 minutes to race but it was worth the wait. The carts are  FAST!!!  The building is like a museum with all kinds of racing memorbailia, very well done.  The day before I was there I read that George Lucas was there, if it is good enough for the creator of Star Wars then it is perfect for me.  Go to Pole Position!

"4.5 .5 off for hard ass tires.This is awesome - i've never been gokarting, unless you count MarioKart.Let me tell you, this is NOTHING like MarioKart. These things go somewhere around 60MPH, and my best time around a 14 mile track was 1:27. Yes, minute and 27 seconds! whoo!sliding out is easy to do with their hard tires, but seriously - this requires relinquishing all fears and pushing your driving skills to the extreme! There is seriously very little risk.If you're a speed junkie like me, you HAVE to do this. BTW, with a group, it's 70 bucks, you get use of the lounge (and their wii), a t-shirt, free drink, and 2 times around. Plus you get to race your friends. We were there for a bachelor party and had 13 people.

"Great experience of indoor carting with a bit of technology to boot.  Really impressed with the timed racing and a fairly comprehensive printout for each racer at the end of each race to see how you compare to each other as well as those who have raced that particular week.  Really an awesome experience and highly recommend if have transportation to get to this place!

"This isn't your traditional go karting venue.  Pole Position go karts are  go-karts on steroids!  You have fast electric cars, helmets, and timed laps.  The driving is so serious that you have to watch a video and sign a waiver before they'll let you onto the track.  This place is awesome!  By far the best go karting experience I have ever had!

"Very fun! The acceleration is great! Great to go with bunch of friends! The only caveat is that it's a bit pricey and the race is a bit too short!But you must go there! Seriously, it's a great racing experience!

"This place is just about worth the $30. For your very first time, you enter a username that you'll use every time after. You can input any driver name you want, so don't put something boring like ... your name. You can name yourself anything. I've seen ""Beatbyagirl"" and ""The Stig."" Nice. Before you hit the track, they make you watch a safety instructional video. It's very brief, don't worry. And then ...Seven minutes of fury. The carts go pretty fast. I've heard they peak at 45 mph, but depending on the configuration of the track (they do change it up), you may or may not be able to hit 45. The speed of the carts is also governed by remote control just in case some one wipes out and the employees need to slow or stop the race. I really liked the printout they give you after your race. You're ranked against the other drivers in your race and against every other driver that's raced at any Pole Position location. After you've registered, every time you race, it keeps a tally of your score for every visit. It makes you want to keep trying to raise your overall score and improve your heat.Sign up for their email notifications -- they are not in excess and being that the price of a regular is a little high, it helps to stay up to date on the specials. There are some people that go to PP that are no joke. They look down on people just wanting to have fun.  They are on a mission. And I get that.

"S---t load of fun!! Just remember to not drink too much the night before.

"This was my first time doing in-door go karting and I'm definitely going to do this again.  Went there on a Saturday night around 8pm - staff was friendly, raced right away, and the karts were surprisingly quick.  SUPER FUN!

"THE friendliest staff at both locations in the Las Vegas area.  I always find time to go to Pole Position when I'm in Las Vegas.Wish it wasn't soo busy all the time, but that just means they are doing something right.My favorite races are the team endurance races.  I travel to Pole Position just to do the Memorial Day 500 lap race every year.
",1
"Went on a date with my girlfriend and had a blast!Pole position has faster cars than the usual ones at family fun center places.  The facility is clean and the staff is friendly.I really enjoyed the real time lap times on the jumbo tron so that I could monitor my racing, but the thing that really got me excited was the post race analysis.  As you leave the pit, you are handed a score sheet that shows off your lap times and charts your progress.A 15 lap race is about $25.  We got the 2 races and a T Shirt combo for $45.I would do this again.

"We went here for my older brothers 30th birthday. We had no idea what to expect but were completely sold on this place by the time it was over. The staff was on point, the cars were fast and gnarly, the prices were just right and they even threw in a free race with a text message. I'm definitely going back.
",1
"I go there with my friends in a group to race and like how they can put us all together and not only that like how they time each lap and have the final print out sheet at the end with your time compared to your friends and everyone who laps the top times of the month. Highly Recommend!!!

"Always a great time racing go karts, but even better at pole position raceway!!

"This was one of our Bachelor Party weekend activities that I can actually write about. Initially we went to the other location which is much nearer to the strip, but they were swamped there and it would have taken 3 hours to finish our 3 races that we wanted to purchase. Luckily and fortunately for time purposes and on our wallets we happened to be able to drive to this location. There was no wait, in fact the whole raceway belonged to us, that being a group of 7 guys. The price quote for the 3 race package at the arville location was for 70, but here it was for $60 which comes out to 20 per race. WORD TO THE WISE, it's cheaper here per race.The track was great and everything went without a hitch. The gokarts are electronically controlled and racing suits were not required. Only thing required were the provided rapist masks and helmets. We got shirts at the end of the race also. My only warning is after racing while driving I felt like I could drift and do all kinds of crazy things, but luckily I didn't for the safety of my fellow brothers.

"Love this place every time I go.  Extremely fun.  Best go kart place in town.

"I like this location better than the one by the strip.  It is cleaner and the staff is nicer.  More for locals so no surprise.

"This place is definitely hidden in the corner but it was great all the same! The staff is super friendly and the actual racing was so much fun! Once you get the hang of it, there is no stopping you. A little pricey but still a great place to come every once in a while.

"My girls (ages 8 and 10) attended a summer camp session here.  They loved it!  The younger one started out very tentative and the people there worked with her and she was able to become much more comfortable and confident in the kart (and cut her time in half!).  The played games, drove the karts and just had an overall great time.  Wonderful way to spend a few days in the summer.  I hope they do some on the kids school holidays!  We will be back for sure.

"I've been coming to this gurudwara for almost a year and a half now. I never knew they were on yelp. I hope it's not bad karma to rate your religious center, so here's hopin'!! For those of you who may not know, this is the holy center for those of us of the Sikh faith. You do not have to be Sikh to visit. Anyone is welcome (there's free food!) The only thing is you must cover your head and take off your shoes. I'm happy to have found this gurudwara in Las Vegas!!
",1
"If it wasn't for yelp i would never knew that there is a Gurudwara Sahib in Las Vegas area. Beautiful Building and open to all regardless of gender and race. i uploaded few pictures i hope you guys like them.  This place is 20-25 minutes away from Las Vegas Strip. There is another Sikh Temple which is very close to the Las Vegas airport.

"After moving here from California,I assumed that there are no South Indian temples in Az , I was proved wrong! The temple is new all main deities and good priests..worth visiting if you are in sun valley

"Very powerful positive energy. I was  fortunate to get blessings from Satya Narayan Ji who was visiting from Udupi , Mangalore , India .

"I am South Indian Hindu Brahmin by background.  I go regularly to this tempe and pay my respects.  Please note that you must wear full trousers if you visit here.  They do enforce it.  This is a good temple to attend.
",1
"Very nice and quiet temple.  Priests are very good and accommodating. If you have pooja at home this is the best place to bring the priest from. You don't have to pick and drop them, they will drive and come. Only disadvantage is that it's too far from Phoenix.
",1
"A great temple built along traditional lines.  Has a quiet and meditative feel upon arrival.  Very engaged group of people attend and everyone is welcome.  The only downside is that it is far from the Valley -- but definitely worth the trip.
",1
"This Gurudwara Sahib is only 10-15 minutes away from Las Vegas Strip and 5 minutes away from the airport. The head priest was really nice and offered us refreshments. There is another Sikh Temple ""Gurudwara Baba Deep Singh"" which is 30 minutes away.

"Remember When.... I always do when I go to this ice cream shop... The oldies playing and the best and biggest ice cream in Pgh.. The large ice cream cone comes out the side door cause they can't fit out the window...WoW it's great and has been great for many many years.. Been going there since I was a young young lad I'm now 27 and take my family there we love it... Keep up the good work
",1
"This is by far, the BEST soft serve ice cream place in southwestern PA. The ""flavor of the week"" is always interesting-and tasty! Though, I am somewhat disappointed that they've switched to a lower grade ice milk, for their vanilla and chocolate offerings. I don't know if this is a matter of cutting corners, or if the better stuff simply isn't available any longer. Either way, this place is still leaps and bounds ahead of DQ, Tastee Freeze, etc. It's definitely worth the trip. It's mostly street parking, though they do have about 3-4 parking spaces off to the side. Serving sizes are huge! The small cone here, is the same size as a DQ large. And the large is SO big, they can't fit it through the window-they hand it out the side door.If you want a real ""Kodak moment""-order a large cone for the kids, and keep the camera, and wet wipes handy!
",1
"My favorite ice cream place in Pittsburgh... they have over a dozen varieties of soft serve... caramel, coconut, peach, pineapple, peanut butter... and I can never decide which to get. They're all yummy. I've never tried the food, but who cares, it's all about the soft serve!

"The best place for an artic swirl. :)

"i love this place more than any other place ever before in the history of places and me eating at them.not only is the ice cream made from local heroes,turner dairy, but the man who operates this fine establishment, chuck page, is one of the friendliest people in pittsburgh.there are so many options, i hate to say i've gotten the same thing more than twice, a couple of faves:thin mint artic swirlcoffee ice cream with chocolate sprinklessouthside shake!!!(sundae on top of a milkshake) best ever!
",1
"I grew up in Baldwin, so as a kid, the family and I would always frequent this place often. The Best ice cream around!!! I have to agree the arctic swirl is the best around!!! I suggest you try the chocolate covered pretzel!!! YUMM-O!!!! Good prices and fantastic people working there!!!
",1
"I love little soft serve places like this.  The ice cream here gets an A+.  I had my classic--small vanilla cone dipped in rainbow sprinkles.  People were talking about their family memories from when they'd eaten here in summers past in line--I'm not from the area, but it seems to be somewhat of an institution.  Just on our first stop we saw families of all ages, couples, bikers...everyone can enjoy this place.  Definitely stop by if you're headed to the south side!
",1
"I've been coming to Page's since I was a kid and at 25 I still get that ""YAY ICE CREAM!"" feeling when I go here.  Their soft serve ice cream is great and their Hawaiian IceSlushes come in several different flavors.  The dips on their ice cream cones are very good and very popular as well.  However, my favorite thing to get their is their Artic Swirls which also come in distinct and fun flavors (I really enjoy the Banana Cream Pie).  Did I mention the great prices and friendly staff  This place has been a staple of the South Hills and it never fails to attract a large crowd of people.  You can't go wrong with Page's!
",1
"This is one of the places we miss the most since moving from Pittsburgh. We visit every time we are here during its open months though. A visit a few weeks ago was just as good as ever! I adore their Southside Shakes (half shake half sundae). Their homemade ice cream cookies rock as well! And I love that they put plastic covers with a lip on their ice cream cones. Helps keep little (and big) hands clean while enjoying a cone. Prices can't be beat, the line moves fast, and everyone is always friendly. Will be back the next time we visit for sure!

"Considering my absolute love for sweets - and more specifically, ice cream - it just doesn't make sense that it took me nearly 6 years of living in Pittsburgh to go to Page Dairy Mart. The only bad thing is that it's too close to where we live, so I can expect my sugar intake to go through the roof now.As you walk up, it's easy to be overwhelmed by the signage and menu, as they seem to have everything that you could ever imagine. In fact, you might just be better off walking up and ordering whatever you want without looking at the menu. Odds are, they'll just smile and run off to make it. I mean, if they have toasted coconut soft serve ice cream, what don't they have, rightThe people that work there are all really pleasant and the ice cream is excellent! It is cash only, so that might be a downside if you're just randomly stopping by for the first time, but it's one place where the long lines are truly warranted in this town. Don't worry, though, usually the line isn't actually long at all. They take your order quickly at Page and your order will actually be up impressively fast for the amount of people ordering thanks to Page Dairy Mart's army of ice cream servers on staff. That ""line"" of people will disappear as quickly as a new one appears.A night hasn't gone by since our first visit that my wife and I haven't wanted to go back. Only our conscious willpower has kept us away, and there aren't a lot of places that have left me feeling that way, so kudos to Page Dairy Mart and their staff! Heck, it's snowing today, and I'm probably going to go!

"Hubby and I have taken to driving up Carson street to get to the Southside in order to avoid that HORRENDOUS traffic in Squirrel Hill.  We drove by Page Dairy Mart a few times and each time he would casually mention that he would like to go there someday.Well, we did.I wish I could comment on one of the DELICIOUS looking Sundaes, but I'm watching what I eat soooo... frozen yogurt it was.What I can say is that the yogurt was smooth and creamy and I LOVE that they have a ton of flavors they can ""mix into"" the yogurt so you can get almost any flavor you want.  Hubby had a cone of regular soft serve ice cream and said it was really yummy.  He also had an order of cheese sticks and said they were just o.k., so we will probably stick to ice creamfrozen yogurt from this place.The kids working were fast and friendly so we left them a nice tip.  As someone who worked her way through college working at a frozen yogurt shop I can say -- TIP YOUR SERVERS, even if just your change -- they will greatly appreciate it.  :-)

"Been ordering from them since the early 90's. Always hot and fresh.  Best white pizza I ever had. Hoagie's are great. Burgers with curly fries with cheese is always a favorite. Sometimes they don't answer the phone for what ever reason, but when they do its great.

"Whaaaat! Noone's reviewd Scoops This place is the ultimate hangout. Young and old alike. The prices are average, the flavors are plentiful, and the staff is always friendly (always a plus on my list.) It's a few blocks from my house and I remember on hot summer days grabbing my sisters, yelling upstairs to our parents ""We're going to Scoops!""  and walking up there. We'd taste the flavors we were trying to decide over (they give you little spoons to do this!) and then we'd pick. There's also an assortment of frozen yogurt, sorbet, milkshakes, toppings, candy, and sodas, too! After paying, we'd take our cones outside and sit on the steps chatting well into dusk. Many people come here all year round. Everyone in the neighborhood knows each other and you're bound to run into someone you know.Great place for ice cream and making memories.

"Yay!  Closest one that was open since the Greentree location on Noble Roman's was closed.  The entry and exit are a tad precarious, but well worth the Dairy Queen goodness.  If you aren't familiar with the area, make certain you bring your GPS or you will get lost.  Good service and great ice cream.

"This was the most amazing (and authentic) Ice Cream Parlor I have ever been too.  Really, it gets the biggest points for being authentic.  The decor is old-school 1920s style: wood paneled booths, old telephone cubbies, a beautiful marble ice cream bar, and bar stools with the seats shaped like soda caps.  The walls are lined with glass drug store display cases - now filled with an assortment of glass ware and interesting ice cream parlor related paraphernalia. I heard about Klavon's first while watching a WQED special on the strip district.  When the special was filmed, the second generation of owners (the son and wife of the founders) had recently passed away. The parlor stayed closed for a few years according to my fiance. So when I decided after the hot summer day that scorched Pittsburgh yesterday meant an ice cream run, the fiance immediately had me check the hours for Klavon's. I was greatly surprised to find out that their summer hours go till 9:00pm on Sundays! YAY - we had enough time to get there and enjoy the ice cream.The place was packed with I would guess around 20 to 30 people awaiting or enjoying their ice cream. The ops are so efficient it didn't take long for them to whip up an extremely DELICIOUS Sunday called the ""Chocolate Delight."" So for atmosphere, service, and a AMAZING ice cream sunday - check out Klavon's!!
",1
"This place is a MUST!  I don't live in Pittsburgh anymore but visit often throughout the year and go often when I'm in town.  I'm a native Pittsburgher and I didn't even know about them until well after college.  Now I'm hooked.  They have a penny candy section!  Remember the penny candy stores that used to dot Pittsburgh's neighborhoods I hadn't thought of those in years until I stepped into Klavon's.  It does that to you, it takes you back. You'll understand what I mean the minute you're there.  The owners and the people who work there are SO WONDERFUL you'll want to go back and back.The ice cream is delicious and they have the best homemade ( I think) whipped cream.  I often get amaretto and it is scrumptious.  You can have jimmies, sprinkles, caramel, nuts, etc.  The atmosphere will kill you, and the story behind the place is really interesting.  Look it up or have them tell you.  It is authentic old Pittsburgh.  You won't be disappointed if you go here.  It's an experience and a wonderful one.  I can't say enough positive things about it.They have a small parking lot behind the building.  It's not that far away from the lively part of the Strip District.  A nice afternoon would be shopping for produce down the street and walking up to Klavon's for a treat.

"awesome!the shakes. and ice cream. and candy. and food. and the decor!

"I first heard about this place (or saw it) on one of the Rick Sebak WQED documentaries about Pittsburgh (which btw you should watch them ALL - they are fantastic).  In the program the place was old and run down and waiting to be remodeled.  He then did an update to that doc in which it wa reopened.  When I saw this I had to go.This place it amazing.  The only classic soda fountain ice cream shop I know of.  It is soooo cool.  Classic style soda fountain, vintage hard to find candy.  The decor is just great.I totally admire the owner for getting this place together and reopening it.

"I stopped in at Klavon's last weekend for the first time. I stopped in around 8pm, and even though it seemed like the neighborhood was deserted, Klavon's was packed! Very popular spot!  If you are on the Strip in PGH, you have to check this place out. Taking a step into Klavon's is like taking a step back in time. This place was originally an old drugstore soda fountain from the 1920's. The inside is all original complete with 3 old telephone booths, stained glass windows, beautiful counter top, fancy chrome soda fountains, and several glass display cases displaying items from times past! Stop in here for a quick lunch and a shake or an ice cream cone.. or share a $20 Super Bowl Sundae with friends.. if you dare! ;)

"We just happened to wander in after an afternoon of exploring Pittsburgh.  What a gem!  What a lucky place to stumble in!Klavon's was a drugstoresoda fountain in the early 1900s.  All the original counters, glass cases filled with old bottles, stools, and mixers are still there.  We had the turtle sundae with amaretto whipped cream, which was amazing.  I can't wait to come back and try their phosphates and egg creams!  It was like stepping into a time machine. You can tell this place is beloved by locals; several elderly couples, families with children, and single people with dogs on leash came by for cones, sundaes, and floats on the beautiful sunny day.  The grandson of the original owners was chatting with customers, and the place had a really special vibe.You almost never see places like this anymore - if you're in Pittsburgh, don't miss it!
",1
"Lots of history at this place.  Once a drug store, now an ice cream parlor.  Be sure to read the interesting story of this place, and check out the flood line when you visit.  You can also sign their guest book while you're there.The guys working here were extremely nice.  They were very patient while I perused their extensive menu.  They offer all sorts of ice cream creations such as floats, sundaes, splits, and milkshakes.  They even offer no sugar added and lactose-free options as well as flavored whipped cream.  In the end I decided on a single scoop of ice cream in a cone - how boring.
",1
"4 stars for the ice cream.... 5 stars for the experience.Booths, tables, counter with stools... plenty of seating in this old time ice cream parlor filled with history run by the family of the grand parents who first opened the place as a pharmacy in 1923.Personable service with a dash of humor.They serve Hershey's Ice Cream which has been operating out of Harrisbugh since 1926 (and has nothing to do with the Chocolate Company).Hershey's Ice Cream has a smooth creamy texture with good flavor.  Nice place to visit when in the strip district.

"Awesome place to go on a date. Cheap and super cute.

"When I die I hope I come back as an ice cream bowl at Klavon's so I can forever spend my days covered in mint chocolate chip and watching people smile. I don't know...maybe not, but I do love mint chocolate chip and old skool ice cream parlors and Klavon's does both really well. This is a list of things at Klavon's that make me feel like vintage stuff isn't only for grandparents and ice cream isn't just for kids: Amaretto flavored whipped cream, swivel stools with red tops, high backed wooden booths, a man behind the counter with a pure white handlebar mustache, a hammered tin ceiling, and large pecan balls.You can go with chocolate or vanilla, but when I get the chance to have a pecan ball, I'm no idiot, I take it. A pecan ball, my friend, is ice cream rolled in pecans, covered in hot fudge or caramel and then topped with whipped cream. That's all tasty, nutty, fudgy goodness, but if you wake up feeling like painting the town gold and you want something that tastes like it was made for Cleopatra by Mark Antony's own hands, get a scoop of coffee, a scoop of pecan and top it with Amaretto whipped cream: I'm hoping to get this added to the menu under the name ""Magic Magic Explosion."" They have a picture of Joe Biden posing with the owners; it's taped to the mirror behind the bar and quite adorable. ""He was very nice and left $20 for the next little girl in line to buy her ice cream with,"" the owner told me.  Also, $20 worth of ice cream! Two scoops only runs five bucks. Joe Biden--excuse me, Mr. Biden--you are a true American hero and I, for one, am happy someone finally realized the importance of children having tons and tons and tons of ice cream. Good show, sir, good show.

"I think it may be a crime to give fewer than five stars to Twisters.  Seriously, they're awesome.  Their soft-serve (try half chocolate, half vanilla!) is probably the best on the planet and they offer homemade ice cream sandwiches.  Everything is affordable, so you can easily feed your frozen dessert addiction.  On hot days, or heck, even on lukewarm days, this is the place to be.
",1
"They have awesome soft serve, home made ice cream sandwiches.  I look forward to the time when twisters reopens after the winter.  They are cheap, friends, and most importantly delicious!  Make sure you get ice cream sandwiches to go, because after you finish one you'll want another one!
",1
"The beauty of living directly next to Twisters is that well I have an unlimited supply of frozen goodies right in my backyard literally.I only get the chocolate vanilla swirl for myself and a small scoop of sugar free vanilla ice cream for the puppy.The ladies that work there during the summer are always super nice.Nothing to ever complain about here.

"Jitters has great coffee and a great atmosphere. Its cozy and has a European vibe. There is outdoor seating and the noise level is just right; quiet enough to get work done, loud enough to obscure conversations. The crowd is diverse - groups of locals, internationals, and people of all ages, but everyone is friendly and down to earth. If you are new to the area, I highly recommend it. It is a progressive coffee shop where people sip their coffee and enjoy it. A refreshing escape from the typical grind ;)

"Big fan!  First time i have ever been to this place, and the milkshake I got was delicious.  My mother also got a frozen coffee, and I think I wound up drinking all of it for her.The cookies that were there also were great.  I am not sure whether they cooked them there fresh or not, but they were delicious.  Defiantly the best stop my mother and I had while we were on Walnut street, and i would venture back to the place in a second.PS the wait staff was also very pleasant and kind.

"My favorite coffee shop on Walnut St.  Most of the folks in there are regulars who greet each ohter by name.  I did my job search there this winter so I was in daily and I too, got to know everyone there.The coffee is great, the staff is friendly, and they have free wireless.  One day I couldn't get the wireless to work and the guy who does their IT just happened to be in the shop, and not only did he set my wireless up for me (which he didn't have to do), he also fixed my computer which he REALLY didn't have to do.This place has a warm, friendly, welcoming environment and is a lot quieter that hte coffee tree.  It is my fave coffee shop! The also serve ice cream, and have outdoor seating which is perfect for summertime.

"This is by far my favorite place to get coffee ever. If you are a student, or maybe a recent graduate in need of Internet this is the place to go. Grab a coffee and grab a seat inside or outside and enjoy using the Internet as long as you like. NO TIME LIMIT!

"Awesome staff, quick and accurate service, great tasting coffee and free wifi... Umm, what else do you need  I avoid the other coffee spots on Walnut either because the staff ain't so hot or it's always jam-packed.

"Halfpenny just served me the creamiest, chocolaty-iest chocolate ice cream I've had in like, forever!Working out of our Charlotte location this week, I missed my office's Cookie Wednesday.....but not to cry bc this location has Ice Cream WednesdaysStopped by the previous morning to stock up on water & the lady was super-friendly.  She chatted up my coworker (he was a local) and there were yummy looking bagels & pastries - prepackaged but still looked yummySo when this super-decadent, ultra-creamy ice cream is given to me, one bite was all it took for me to be in luv.  Others got Strawberry & Vanilla & I gotta say that Strawberry looked homemade w its huge hunks of fresh berriesThen I'm told it came from the very same place I'd been to, just the day beforeMy coworker also said they make a mean milkshake!  Will totally be back!!

"I love a place where you can get a sandwich on a toasted ""everything"" bagel.  Halfpenny's is my jam when I just want a bagel sandwich and some chips, and maybe a yogurt.  The staff is super duper awesome, and I always seem to catch myself in the elevator with the owners and their family, they are so cute.  This is a great ""quick fix"" lunch place, and I've heard from co-workers that the breakfast stuff is pretty good too.  All around solid choice for me!

"Cheap, delicious, fresh coffee.  I'm not talking about the stale cup of plain joe you get at ANY other regular coffee shop that tastes like dirty burned coffee beans.  If your office doesn't have a coffee maker, I highly suggest making a trip down here.  If you're concerned about the preparation - it's regular old drip coffee, not percolator, so do with that information what you will.A medium java sets you back only $1.70, and they have a ton of flavored coffees if you're into that.  Normally I'm not, but I tried the ""Hawaiian Macadamia Nut"" today, and ALOHAAAAA... delicious.  You can't really beat it for a cheap and good quality cuppa.  (*side note* there is a $3 minimum for credit cards, so bring cash if you're coming down for just coffee)

"This is my spot for coffee and bagels each day. Ice cream is also fantastic... They remember what I order and I get my bagel and coffee in about 3 minutes. Service doesn't get any better than here!!

"Halfpennys has been my go-to spot for lunch for years. Frankly, dollar-for-dollar, it is the best value in Charlotte for that quick, inexpensive, grab-and-go lunch, especially for those who eat out on a regular basis and just need FOOD. I have tried to find other places to get sandwiches (often more expensive), but the value isn't there. I'd rather pay $5 at halfpennys than $8 at some other flashy joint or chain. Just a better deal, better quality, better service. Try the egg salad sandwich. I haven't found it's equal. Moreover, it has been consistently good since i found this place 10 years ago. And if you have room, get yourself a chocolate malt. By far the best malt I've ever had.

"I went here because I wanted to try a new salon and I'm glad I did. There was no wait time and the staff was very warm and friendly. I had a pedi and a full set, both look beautiful. It was $25 for a full set with gel and $21 for the pedi. I highly recommend Central Nail.

"Went there for the first time today and left impressed. $30 for a mani pedi and the salon was clean and the staff was friendly. I was looking for Lincoln Park After Dark in their OPI selection and found a bottle of the color that was almost empty and when I asked if it would still be OK to pickuse the bottle they promptly came up with a fresh new bottle. I picked a light pink shade for my mani and Hanna warned me it was very light and suggested another option but I insisted. After the color was on I found out what she meant...the color was very transparent. Transparency in color doesn't bother me but I thought it was nice that she tried to help. While she was doing my mani and asking a few friendly questions Hanna discovered I was on my lunch break. Once she found out that information she asked how long I still had and made sure I was out on time. Even with her being sensitive to my time constraints I left with a great mani pedi that doesn't look rushed. All in all a great find. I think I've finally found my nail salon of choice in central phx. Thank goodness!

"First-time visitor despite living in the neighborhood forEVer. What a hidden gem! Walked right in, no wait (ok, it was Monday before lunch), and the manicurists were so sweet and pleasant. Not a massive collection of colors, but I found exactly what I wanted. They did a beautiful job (standard pedicure, for $18), with a nice long pumice-stone scrub-down, and I noticed the technician cleaning the basin directly afterward. Lovely employees, good hygiene, and an impeccable pedicure at SUCH a good price. Central Nails will be my new go-to pedi place!

"Simple, clean, great work on my pedicure.  I found this place on yelp (of course), and I sat in the chair looking around trying to figure out why it was different.  First, I noticed that all the customers seemed to know all the workers and vice versa.  Maybe it was just a nice neighborhood I thought.  I eventually got to talking with the person doing my pedi, Kim.  I told her I found the place on Yelp.  And I read her the reviews - so I asked who Hannah was - ""over there"" she said.  ""She's my sister.""  ""In fact, we're all sisters.""  Ohhhh this is different.  And then she told me they'd been open 15 years.  That's way different.  These are trained people.BTW, I wrote this review months ago, but Yelp just told me I never finished it.  So here it is Yelpers.  I like it!

"Stopped in here to get a manipedi after reading great reviews. It smelled like fresh bleach when I walked in and the place was very clean! Everyone there was very friendly and welcoming and I had a great experience. My manicurist spent a lot of time making sure my nails were perfect as I explained I was getting them done for a wedding. Fair price, great service and very clean!

"So happy!  Just walked in, and someone was able to take me right away for an acrylic set.  My nails are nice and short and thin just like I asked for!  Nice polish job too!  Just moved to the area and I think I found my new nail spot!  Can't wait to come back for a pedicure soon :) $25 for a GREAT acrylic set is nice!  Oh, and I was in and out in less than an hour....not too shabby for a full set.Thanks Central Nails!

"So I've been with carefree tan for about 2 years now and I love it! I would seriously not go anywhere else!Me and my boyfriend are there everyday! The staff is very friendly and efficient. Some people would say that it's a little pricey but I beg to differ me and my boyfrind have unlimited tanning with mistique included on a family plan which is definitly worth doing,if an option and it's great we love it!The beds are awesome, very powerful and have built in fans. The mistique is awesome! I spray every time after I lay down and I get really dark! even after the first time.highly recommended!

"Everyone here is great!  Tam and Danny really know what their doing with this place and the prices are more than fair.  Ladies, if you need a set of nails, Tony is your guy. (sorry Danny, haven't tried you just yet)  Super fast and does an uh-maz-ing job! For pedicures, all the girls are super nice and do a good job-but i would recommend Tam if you're making an appointment.Clean facilities and great massage chairs for the pedi's. Broad color selection and their great with designs on all nails too. Now quit reading this and go get those nails did!

"Dropped in last minute on saturday to get a gel mani & pedi. Completely became a fan right off the bat. Friendly staff and it was definitely warm and inviting! I was fit in quickly and was able to get a super incredible gel manicure def one of the best! Highly recommended! The color selection is unlike any other place I've ever been. You can actually show up with out a polish and know you will be able to find a shade you want. The pedicure was just absolutely amazing! Hands down! Luv luv luv this cute and clean salon! This place really pays attention to the fine details and the staff is super friendly and funny. I had such a great time getting my nails done. I'll definitely be back soon!

"Loved this place. They do an excellent job and have the nicest girls! I had a horrible experience with my 91 yr old mom just that morning, they wouldn't do her nails. New to the area and didn't know where to go. I drove around for an hour and new there was one in this area. We were greeted so warm and friendly, they were excellent with my mom and took very good care of both of us. We had Denise and Anna, love them! Will drive the extra mile because of their warm and friendly attitudes, great Pedi and Gel manicure.

"When I lived in Chandler over 3 years ago I was a regular at this nail salon and loved it but then I moved to Cali.  When I returned to AZ in October of 2011, I decided to go back to check them out... they have moved and are even better than before!  Nancy is awesome at eye lash extensions!! I have been to many places between Cali and AZ and Nancy by far does a fabulous job!  Her technique is unique and she is a perfectionist! Extensions can be pricey at first but well worth the investment! The initial cost is approx $200 and I get refills every 2 weeks, i no longer use mascara or eyeliner ans less makeup in general because my eyelashes compensate for it.  I get compliments almost everyday on my lashes; the length, how naturally full they look and how beautiful my eye are.Go see Nancy and let her work her magic!

"I'm very hesitant when going to nail places. From reading all of the scary stories of nail fungus and other horrible things happening because of not using proper sanitation, you can see why I'd be apprehensive. I've had my fair share of bad experiences, especially since everyone cuts too much of my cuticles and I bleed every time. My coworker goes here and recommended it to me. I made an appointment for the Brown Sugar Pedicure $28 and the callous removal $5. I asked for a more senior nail tech working that day and I got Twee. She was so friendly and sweet, did a fantastic job (no bleeding, yay!) and she took her time and was very detailed. I am going to go back next month before my Hawaii trip and get my hands and toes done with shellac so it doesn't chip on my vacation. The atmosphere is very calming and soothing. There are no TVs on the walls, and the music is of a spa. Love it!
",1
"Love this place!!!!  They are the most detail oriented nail salon I have been to. Their flowers and designs are fantastic!(see my photo) I also like that they have Zoya polish for those of us who are a little conscious of the chemicals in regular polish. Foot massages are great and they take time to do both manicures and pedicures to your standards. I've been coming here for over 3 years now and this is my 1 nail salon.
",1
"VERY HAPPY! My sisters and I came in on Sunday for manipedis. Everyone was nice and engaging the whole time.I received a pedicure from Hugh, (sorry if I miss the spelling), he was fantastic! The only issue I had was the same with all the nail salons I've gone to - its quiet....too quiet. A stern look from the head librarian quiet. Id prefer a little more client centered chatting IE the weather or the game or your boyfriend or whatever.

"I have been getting my nails and wax done here for years! Nancy is incredible- I always leave happy with the services.

"I've been hanging out in Tempe this weekend thinking about what I wanted to do to pamper myself a bit.I wanted to do something girly - so I went to the front desk of the hotel to inquire about a salon that would be able to give me a pedicure. Magen Nail was close by - so I hopped on board the hotel shuttle and off I went.This isn't one of those elite fru fru types of places - but it was clean and they were able to take me right away. The nail technician was very cute but professional. She wore the appropriate garb (face mask and gloves) and used sterilized implements that she had just taken out of the enclave. I was in heaven having my tootsies soaked and rubbed. She even did a salt scrub and massage on my calf muscles - I could have spent all afternoon there. After applying a little purple polish, she painted some cute little flowers on my toes and added a couple of rhinestones and had me sit with my toes under the nail dryer.What a nice way to spend a couple of hours...
",1
"Before I went to Vegas this past weekend, a pedicure was a necessity. I decided to check out Magen Nail in Tempe since it's close to where I live and they were open until 7 pm on Friday. You can either make an appointment or just walk-in...I made an appointment but it wasn't necessary. The interior is very simple and clean which is fine with me since I didn'tt need anything fancy. The staff is very friendly and the technician who gave me my pedicure was very sweet. We chatted the whole time in fact. She did a great job especially with the salt scrub and calf massage (work that day had been stressful and busy so I was in desperate need of relaxation). My pedicure was $19 and the salt scrub was an extra $5, but was totally worth it to me. A great experience and I will definitely return in the future for manicures and pedicures.
",1
"Saw the reviews on yelp and thought I better check out what all the stars were all about.  I went for a regular Pedicure ($19 to start) on a random Tuesday afternoon.  It is your typical strip mall nail salon but was very clean and nice inside.  I was greeted by the techs and had no wait to get my pedi and boy what a pedi it was!  My nail tech was very nice and talkative.  She wore gloves and used the blue powder to sanitize the bath.  She asked if I wanted my nails cut and filed instead of just buzzing through with the scuff file.  I opted for the sea salt add on for $5 and she literally massaged my legs with the sea salt for 10 minutes!  The sea salt was a nice quality, wasn't too coarse and didn't burn my legs since it sat on them for a while.My nail tech had a waxing appointment come in about  12 way through so another tech took over.  He was very nice and polite but his leg massage was out of this world.  He worked on my pressure points on the bottoms of my feet as well as my calf muscles.  Another ten minute massage on top of the ten min sea salt massage!My pedicure was $24 with the sea salt but they start at $19.  They also gave me a rewards card for a free service after you have so many manipedi's done.  My ONLY gripe is that their colors were very dated but I bring my own polish with me so very easy to bypass that problem.  This is my new go to spot for nails!  Please please please open a Magen II a little closer to Scottsdale :)
",1
"This place is really friendly, quick to seat you and get you started for a manipedi, and it was an overall great experience to just relax and enjoy! I totally recommend this place for nails!
",1
"This place is great! I have had between 6 and 7 pedicures at Magen Nail and loved them all. They do beautiful little flowers on your big toe with crystals if you ask them to! The artistry is really lovely. The service is always speedy and friendly-- a nice, no-nonsense kind of place. I went here with my sister who has a deformed nail on one of her feet. The pedicurist shaped the nail carefully and made it look ""normal""! She was very pleased at the final result.

"Went here the night before my friend's wedding because I was a bridesmaid and found out at rehearsal the other girls got manis and designs on their pedis. I had only got a basic pedi that morning. I only had about an hour before the dinner and found this place on Yelp closeby. Got in immediately. VERY nice staff - even gave me a bottled water. Got a gel coat mani (no tips) and it lasted many weeks. Shape I wanted and looked great! I just needed a design on my toes and she did them perfectly as described and they matched the other bridesmaids (just by my description - she didn't see the other girls). A true artist - beautiful work and still fast! Wish I lived nearby because I would like to go back more often! I heard while there they were going to repaint, etc so it may be an even better environment now. Would definitely go back!

"LOVE!  found this place in a pinch when my usual place was closed in the middle of the day for no apparent reason.  i didn't have to wait at all.  got a gel manicure for the first time and it lasted for over a month while looking perfect!  only needed to get it re-done because my nail grew out so much.  everyone there is super nice and the price is wonderfully low for my student budget.  i only used to get my nails done for special occasions because of cost but..  now my nails are always looking great thanks to this place.
",1
"They are now under new management and completely remodeled the inside. It's fantastic! Fast, quick service with brand new massage chairs and I loved their background music. They also have a new discount card program. Get your nails done 8 times and receive $8 off your next service. I'm happy it's so close to work and I can be in and out within a lunch hour.
",1
"I'm almost reluctant to even write a review for Magen because I don't want everyone to start going there.  I know, I'm selfish, but I just love this place so much and will NEVER go to another nail salon.  The people working there are BEYOND friendly and always bend over backwards for me and my friends when we go in.  They will make sure that we have pillows, water, and can sit by each other to chat.  I have even had one of the ladies paint my nails while I was getting a pedicure because she didn't want me to have to get up.They have hot stones for your massage and they don't skimp on the time.  I think my last foot massage there was close to 10 minutes.They have great prices and awesome service.  The only thing that would make this place better would be a glass of wine!

"Henry and his wife own this salon -- OMG, the BEST nail service I've ever received!!! The wife is a NAIL ARTIST! She has the MOST amazing nail art I've ever seen!!! Their prices are FANTASTIC and they are SUPER NICE!!! Awesome place and it's SUPER close to my work!!! Love going here!!!!

"I love Fancy Nails. It is my GO-TO Nail place.They shop is located in a shopping center near Sahara and Decatur. The owner's name is Jennifer and she is really sweet.I like to keep my nails really short (so I can speed type my Yelps) and the aestheticians here never mind me asking if I can get them shorter. If I bump my nails or dent the polish (which is all the time) they fix it for free. I also like my acrylic thin and Yen does it right, every single time. And she's quick!You can do walk-in or appointments.They offer a full range of spa services at decent prices. Waxing, facials, pedis, manis, airbrush, and gel.The shop is clean and tidy and had a nice Vietnamese flair. Whenever I leave here, my mind sings, you FANCY, HUH.Wanna get Fancy, this is your one chance and they won't let you down (or Reba)!

"I went here to get laser hair removal.  Angela was amazing.  Very knowledgeable.  Explained to me step by step each process and was right on the money regarding pain expectations.  I had my lip, underarms and bikini line done.  I absolutely love this and would recommend her to everyone!!!

"I see Jim Allen for myopractics and massage, and he is amazing. I have seen a chiropractor before, but I definitely prefer the myopractics where soft tissue manipulation is used to balance your body instead of just cracking it back into place. It's a much more holistic and gentle way to restore your body to it's natural state of movement and relieve tension and pain.His massages are equally amazing and the best I've ever had. He has many years of experience and education, and he is continually learning new techniques. If you are into energy healing and natural healing arts, you will love Jim. He can make you feel like a new person. Jim is amazing and genuinely cares about each and every client, and it comes through in his work. He also does cranial sacral and ayervedic massage and can incorporate specific essential oils to suit your needs.

"I booked Total Bliss for my wedding and they were amazing!First, all my appointments and conversations were done over email as I live in NYC. I was unable to see the salon before booking, but Nancy, the owner, was so incredibly nice. It was a pleasure to work with her. She even bought fruit, cookies, and sparkling cider to help celebrate the day - it was a very sweet gesture.We had three stylists working on our hair - Trish, Paula, and I think Jodi. Trish and Paula were fantastic. Trish worked on my hair and it exactly! matched the picture I brought in. Jodi did a nice job on my friend's hair, however, she was a little impolite in the beginning and did not try to talk to any of us. Trish and Paula were very much apart of the group and did fantastic work.Angela did our make-up, along with another lady who I unfortunately cannot remember. Angela did a wonderful job on my make up and was very personable. The other lady seemed very polite as well.I am extremely happy with our hair (6 of us got our hair done) and make up (5 us got our make up done)! Thank you so much!

"I had a coupon to try this place a few weeks ago, and I had a great experience... Laura did my eyebrows and she did a fantastic job.  She was sweet as can be and professional too.  They offer other kinds of waxing here also.  I made an appointment ahead of time, but I think they are pretty good about walk-ins and last minute appointments also.  The Brow Lady is located in a convenient location and it's small and comfortable inside.  I'll be back to see Laura again soon for sure!Interesting history of 'The Brow Lady' also... read about it at:  http:thebrowladyusa.comThe_Brow_Lady.html  This is the kind of local business that makes you feel good to support!

"It's been over a year since my last Brow Lady review, so it's time for an update...Laura is still the Queen of making me look clean and pretty!  She is sweet as ever and still affordable too.Call today if you need a touch up - I lucked out and found out that this week is a special - brow and lip combo for just $26!Now that I'm living just a few minutes from The Brow Lady, I'll be seeing Laura regularly to keep my brows looking good!

"I love this place! I have white blond eyebrows and eyelashes, and finding a salon that can dye them the correct colors without making a mess of things is difficult at best.  When I explained exactly what I needed the girl who did my tinting (sadly I can't remember her name, but she was super awesome and nice!) got it exactly right. I will be back here every 6 weeks!edit: the person I saw was Laura
",1
"This is the best place to get your brows done. I like it that they check with you to ask aboout medications you may be on with your face, because there can be serious problems if you wax on certain meds. No other place has ever asked me this!

"Laura has now moved to the wind and water spa in Scottsdale. She is no longer (to my dismay) at the The brow lady. I went back to the brow lady and found this out the hard way. They did an ""ok"" job, but it wasnt Laura!!!

"STAFF: If you do go and don't want any of the girls previously talked about in other reviews you should ask for COURTNEY. She's new I think because her business cards weren't in yet but she is one of the nicest people I've met. The rest of the staff seemed kinda out of it but Courtney was very professional which is something I value and whom I'd definitely recommend.ENVIRONMENT: It looks like a hole in the wall type place from the outside  but Courtney did a great job of making me feel comfortable and welcomed  (even though I felt bad because I was late to my appointment).OVERALL EXPERIENCE: I had never gotten an eyebrow wax before and let Courtney know my concerns but she talked me through everything, very good at answering all my questions during the process, and was very thorough with the job, I never felt like she was rushing just to get me in and out (which I've noticed a lot of spa people do). After coming home to read the negative reviews from this place (largely, if not all, due to staff) I can tell you that I would not go here if Courtney wasn't there, think of her as the new Laura that everyone had been raving about. No one else can compare. :)

"Just had my eyebrows waxed by Courtney. She was great and I love the results! My eyebrows look awesome & sexy! I will definitely go back!
",1
"COURTNEY has been doing my brows for months now, and has always done a great job for me. She's attentive and listens to what I want. I like a natural looking brow, but clean and precise and absolutely NOT over-plucked or over-waxed. My brow hairs are not the thickest so getting juuuust the right ones is crucial... easy to make them look too thin.and just as easy to let one or 2 stray hairs create unpleasant shadows. I've also had the unpleasant experience of lingering redness and irritation - but not with Courtney. I am older so my skin is more fragile; somehow she managed to take that into account and kept the irritation to a minimum. I will certainly go back!

"Amanda....where did you goI had my eyebrows done by Amanda, she did an excellent job! It's been at least a year since I've had my eyebrows done by a skilled aesthetician and I was amazed at how Amanda was able to even out and clean up the shape, it really made a difference. My overall experience at the shop was great; everyone was very professional and made me feel welcomed and comfortable. Customer service and quality for the money determines how I spend my hard earned dollar.....Amanda at The Brow Lady USA will see me again!

"30814. Just wanted to update since it has been awhile since my post. It's been two years, and  I  continue to get my facials and lash extensions done here. In all my visits in the past year, I only had  one negative experience, and it was resolved quickly and professionally. I still love the service, location and people here. Truly the best brow design and lash extensions in Scottsdale. And again, very friendly staff and an owner who is caring and follows through. I've been here since June of 2012.  So far, I have always been treated promptly and kindly. I have Valerie do my brows, and I love them. I didn't realize how different they can look by going to a service that specializes in this, versus just getting them waxed at the nail salon. Big difference! Love it. I felt compelled to write this after seeing all the negative reviews. I have had nothing but positive experiences here, and I actually drive 20 minutes out of my way just to get my brows done here. I haven't had any other services at the Brow Lady, so I can't comment as to that. But, as far as professionalism, nice ladies and prompt service, it's 5 stars.   :o)

"Pretty much all nail salons in Arizona are pretty similar. Feet soak, scrubbed then painted. Not alot of attention to callouses and rough skin  included with the base price which is kind of BS... but like I said, that seems to be the standard in AZ.What set this place apart for me is that she asked me WHY I was getting the pedi. I disclosed that I was departing shortly for a family trip to Hawaii and she suggested a FABULOUS festive nail idea.I have attached a photo of this master piece for your viewing enjoyment :)

"I have nothing but good things to say about this salon.  I have been going to For Nails Only for several months.  The people are very friendly and they make me feel welcome.  They do a quality job and don't rush through the work.  I always feel relaxed and happy when leaving.  Thank you!

"I love Katie's and will not go anywhere else to get my nails done.   I have been going there for about 4 years and have no complaints.  Sure, when you walk in they might seem a little rude, but once you get talking, everyone opens up.  They are actually quite funny.  Katie knows that I am a dog groomer and am very hard on my nails.  My nails do not break and on the rare occasion that they do, Katie is very prompt to repair it.
",1
"Katie's is great.  They listen to what you say, and they can even fix ingrown toenails.  Wait time has never been more than 15 minutes.  Also, Katie remembers everything about everyone!  I have tried almost every other nail salon within a 3-mile radius, and Katie's truly is the best.
",1
"I've been going to Katie for about two years after a referral by my boss. I have gone to many different nail stylists, but have always had problems with the acrylics lifting and cracking because my nails are very curved. With Katie, this has never been a problem. I don't know how she does it, but her acrylics stay put. I always get compliments on my nails - even two weeks after my appointment. They stay looking good for a long time and that is saying something since I am VERY rough on my nails. Katie also has a full rainbow of gel colors available. I recently went through a spell where I wanted something different from my usual pink-and-white so I switched seamlessly to gel for about two months. This was a lot of fun and it is amazing how long the color stays on and shiny. However, I've gone back to pink-and-white because that is how I prefer my nails. Pedicures here are great too... ask for Kevin as he is fabulous.
",1
"Nails are one of my small indulgences- a monthly pedicure keeps my toes in sandal condition during the summer. Historically I haven't had much loyalty to one nail place or another- but this one might change that. I saw Kevin for my appointment, and not only did he do a a fantastic job, but he was personable and nice to talk to. The place was clean and my wait time was minimal. A basic manipedi combo was only $35, which is a steal if you ask me! I'll definitely be back. It gets five stars because if you're comparing it to other strip mall nail places, it's as good as it gets! I figure that's a lot more fair than comparing it to Dolce or the Phoenician.

"Traveling through Arizona and needed some 'me time' once we stopped at our hotel in Scottsdale. I called around, found Gel Q and headed over. Joe, my nail tech was so detail oriented during my entire mani-pedi. He was also very gifted at massage. The atmosphere was tranquil and professional and the pedicure chairs had massagers in them that were to die for! It was just the relaxing appointment I was hoping for. Thank you gel q!

"Finally a good nail spot in OT!  After stopping at several nail salons last Saturday that were closed, packed or too shady to step foot in, we used our Yelp apps and navigated our way to Gel-O! Thank you fellow yelpers for this recommendation!  From the outside this place appears to be a typical strip mall nail salon, but one you walk in it has a slightly classier feel to it.  We were greeted immediately and given an estimated wait.  As I was deciding on a color I noticed something that (shouldn't but) really impressed me.  They don't appear to be watering down their colors, what a treat!  In addition, they had a good selection of modern colors with bottles that were pretty full.  Lately I've noticed that a lot of the nail salons dilute the polish as it is used to make it last longer for them... but as a result it either never dries or flakes off way too quickly. I was also very pleased to see the lady sanitize every single thing she used for the pedicure, including the basket that she stored the tools in, A++!The prices are about $5 more than the typically strip mall salon, but it was well worth it. I had a 4 star spa quality pedicure for half the price. I swear she massaged my feet and legs for about 30 minutes, I was in heaven! I'll definitely be back.

"This place is awesome! Best nail salon I have experienced in a long time. Great prices, great polish selection, and I even got a shoulder massage while my nails were drying. I'll be back!

"This place is great. Now I would like to qualify my 5 stars. These strip mall nail salons usually suck so bad that 1 star is too many. That being said, as a strip mall nail salon goes, this place is top-notch. But don't go expecting some amazing 5 star spa, you won't get it. What you will get is a clean, sanitized, friendly staff. The guy did my pedicure and it was one of the best I've ever had. My feet & calves were so sore from ballet and now - they feel great! I got gels done, and I will say they aren't really set up to do gel toes. (they are for hands). I wish they had the UV light a little more convenient for feet, I had to get up each time, but otherwise a very pleasant experience for a very stressed woman!

"I go here often to either get gel manicures or acrylics and I have not once had a bad experience! The staff who have done my nails have been patient and helpful as well as friendly from my experience. I enjoy that they have a tv in the back of the salon to keep you entertained while you get your nails done. The only thing is they seem slightly expensive to me, for a manicure with gels its $40 and same with pedi and  polish. Then again I don't know rates for other salons so this may be reasonable. I don't have anything bad to say besides the first time I got acrylics there they gave me flares which I didn't like, but I didn't know the difference.

"I am giving this place 5 stars for a strip mall nail salon. It isn't super fancy, but for what it is, it is a great place. The salon is quiet and clean. The people were very nice and they got to me quickly even though I was a walk-in. The woman doing my nails (Loan) was very nice and professional. She clearly paid attention to detail and did a wonderful job on my nails. And I only paid $25 for a gel manicure! I will definitely be returning.

"[DISCLAIMER: the rating of five stars for Bandaids does not directly correlate with the intentions of the establishment, instead, the volumes of unintentional comedy and unsolicited astonishment that may be had at this specific joint]Walking into Bandaids was like witnessing the sneak premier of the cinematic masterpiece 'Showgirls' -- and what I mean is, one is piqued with curiosity, wonderment, the promise of mindblowing mockery, and the anticipation of an inevitable Spidey exit.  This is where the comparison to showgirls ends.  Actually, I don't rememer.  Did showgirls feature a stripper in her 3rd trimesterWhereas the tagline for Showgirls was ""Leave your inhibitions at the door"", Bandaids follows up with ""... and your guns, knives, nerve gases, babies, peg legs, raptor jesuses, gold crown deodorizers, and herpes.""  Although I think most in there ignored that last one.So, upon entrance, you are greeted with a very Judge Dredd-like chain-link protected cashier who takes your Abe Lincoln and motions you over to the bar.  One thing about strip clubs in general, is, you don't really wanna schooch by anyone ... but at Bandaids, they make this awkward dream a reality for everyone!  The walk up to the bar is like cutting to seats 34 and 35 at Giants Stadium.  I felt like Tyler Durden contemplating whether to give the vatos the butt or the crotch as they stare blankly at ""the talent"".Whoa boy.  This place has talent like the old Washington Bullets ... but shorter, fatter, and more pregnant.I gave one of my buddies a dollar to snap into one of the monster's string and she gave him a ""whusssuuup"" that featured her sweet gold grill.  To appreciate this, you must know that my friend is quite possibly the sweetest guy on the planet, and gave a friendly ""Hi!"" to her in return before about-facing to our bistro style table where 8 Coors Lights were posting up our jaws.This was a nice, natural cue for a quick exit, rattled our half-drained beers into the bins and shot out.  We couldn't stomach anymore of anything.But wait.On this page you will notice Jason C., and along with the others in our laughter-induced group, came his big mouth.  This was his opportunity to mock the sawed-off, convertible, primer-gray Chevy Blazer parked mere feet from the entranceexit to Bandaids, and although the details are lost as to the specifics, mentioned something about ""check out THIS fucking thing!"", which was the perfect timing for one of the busted, ghetto-flab strippers to walk out and proceed to angrily say something like ""Fuck you.  That's mine.  What of it""  In response, and generally because he's a giant puss with scary strippers, said something like, ""Oh.  Its nice.  I like it."" before shitting himself.I'm sure the rest of the group howling with laughter really set her mind at peace.  Anyway.  That's the Bandaids story, and you can have one just like it if you give it a chance.

"The motherfucking dive bar of strip clubs.If you BYOC (bring yo own company, bitches!) it is awesome. In this case, I was the company for a totally non-trashy, very classy female friend of mine who was in the mood to slum it. She lives down the block an had been wanting to check the place out for a while, so after a few hours of daydrinking, we hit the spot. Wow.Stretch marks. Lots of grinding and wandering hands. Tits everywhere... and shit, that's just the male patrons, holmes. I was wearing all black (as usual) and put on my sunglasses for the lulz now and then, and my exceptionally skinny and lovely companion was paying with a stack $1's that she won in a dice game the night before... so the ladies and waitress probably figured that she was a stripper (she's actually an RN in an ICU) and that I was her coke dealer, and the guys were jealous that I was hanging with a hot babe whom I didn't have to pay for attention. So I guess that made me by default the coolest motherfucker in the place. How could I not give it 5 stars after thatIn reality we had a sociological discussion about the patrons and employees, and discussed a few articles in the latest issue of the New Yorker, which she happened to have in her purse. Some of the characters we saw:Saigon '68 - Old dude who only got dances from the asian girls, reliving the glory days in 'nam.Hombre - in his sunday finest with cowboy hat and boots, looking very confused. He might have jumped the border last week.PCC - White haired, super thin, wrinkly cracker who probably wandered in from the Phoenix Country Club across the street, in shorts, white polo, knee high white socks, and of course velcro sneakers. He looked reminiscent of a corpse.... except when he got several dances from well endowed black women, at which point he really became alive. Short Dick Man - He had clearly sprouted some wood, and it wasn't very impressive. Vatos - galore.So - think dive bar that is totally ghetto fab. If you wait around long enough, they'll have 2 for 1 drink specials, though I am sure that the ""grey goose"" I ordered was some shitty well shit and not the goose. Whatever. Ghetto fabbbbbbbbbbbbbbbuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!

"5 star reviews aren't just for the fanciest places on Earth.  Oh no.  5 stars within a class.  Bandaids is in it's own class of dirty, run down, last stop stripper establishments and within that class, Bandaids is primo.  I've never had a bad time here.  Never.

"As a Socially Liberal Feminist I would NEVER go here, but if I slipped up, The Hi-Liter  would be my favorite of the genre.I've heard that it's just seedy enough, but not too much, and with top notch ""talent"".  I mean ... that's what I've heard anyway.*Oink Oink*

"Let me start this Yelp by saying I've never given the business to a stripper. Are we clear Ok.I'll tell you why this place gets five stars... Because not one but two of the dancers offered to go home with me. One for $250. She said ""If you have $250, we can go somewhere together."" And then she licked my ear and showed me her guns. Her shift was over and she was in street clothes, mind you.So guess what happened next Stripper two (who actually did leave with me - long story) said, ""Gross, some skanky girl licked you and her breath was terrible."" I was embarrassed, yet psychologically removed from that experience.What happened with Stripper two is a great story but I don't know that I want to share it here. But if you go to this club, one piece of advice (Useful alert!): the less attractive dancers require money to leave with you. The self-possessed hotter ones do not. However, if you get her naked in your bed, do no verify pre-coitus that she is not, in fact, a prostitute, because she will leave and call you names as your front door slams behind her. Or so my buddy tells me. Such trifling arrows of human amusement are not found in this man's quiver of irresponsible behavior.

"Great place. I took my work colleague there and she had a great time. The dancer was all over her and left her virtually touched everywhere. She was hot and so was I. Will definitely be back there soon.

There  all different styles of girls to choose from, tattooed, tits on a stick, average, beautiful, girl next door, beauty is all over the place!! Go, take your girl then go home and do the dirty....

"There are other gentlemen-type places around town that deserve their accolades, but I never have as much fun as when I'm at the Hi-Liter.  A friend from out-of-town wanted to go to a gentlemen-type establishment.  When I suggested the Hi-Liter, she recoiled, saying that the place looks skeezy.  I begged for some faith, and of course, nobody was disappointed.  Cheap (by strip club standards) drinks, friendly staff, everyone in the place - customers and employees - having a good old time.  Upon leaving, we asked for a cab, and one was there in under two minutes.  Here's something that always happens, and it happened again tonight:The waitresses often wear shorts that say ""Hi Liter"" across the derriere.  You'll never notice this until everyone is s-faced, and then someone will say, ""I cant believe that girl's ass says 'Hitler.'""  Then you stare until you regain some vision and realize that it doesn't.  This has happened at least 3 times at this place, no joke.  Might not seem funny, but mix alcohol andor other social lubricants with loud music and and general tomfoolery, and it's funnier than the last three Adam Sandler movies combined (not saying much, but still),Overall, there are other clubs that do other things better, but you'll never have as much fun as you do here.

"I went on a Tuesday night 101111 around 10 pm. Have been here in the afternoon but not at night. The cover was only $5 and they still had the 2 4 1 specials. There was a variety of hot dancers so I got a seat against the wall and had some dances from a hot blonde,  a super hot Latina, and a hot and sexy seductive Hawaiian.  The Hawaiian is who I spent most time with. She had a tight sexy seductive body and crawled all over me. They were all very very close dances. There was skin on skin contact and damn she smelled good. Even though it was a slow night they still had a large variety of dancers. Everytime I am in town I check out this club and they never disappoint. Last time I was here was September 1 and it was the Hawaiians  first night she was fantastic. One tip, if you are getting a hot dance in the main room you know the VIP will be hot. If the lap dance is not hot and you hope it gets hotter in VIP it won't.  Believe me on this. Even if you don't go VIP you will have a  good time. I have been to the other establishments including the nude bars but find this is the one place that never disappoints. The food is good, the dancers are hot, great drink specials, and the bouncers are chill!

"Went late Tuesday afternoon 1025.  The sexy Hawaiian was busy in VIP with regulars but there was a large variety of hot dancers to choose from. I got dances from a damn sexy blonde with beautiful face and gorgeous body and great tat work on the side of her body. She knows  what she is doing and you should get a dance or VIP from her you will never forget it. Lots of cuddling, touching, and grinding. She is usually there in afternoons.  Sabrina is another beauty that knows how to give a hot dance. This place always delivers. If you are wondering where to go this is the place.

"I haven't been to the Hi-liter in years but have fond memories of this fine establishment.  A couple of years ago I was kicked in the head by a dancer who was giving a dance to Mike Tyson...  twice!  There was no blood so I let it slide...  I mean, did I really want to take a chance interrupting Mr. Tyson's good time and risk decapitation  I think not.

"By far, the best Gentleman's Club in Phoenix.  The girls here are gorgeous.  It is a little pricier than some of the other places, but the eye candy is the best.  Have fun other weary travelers!

"Having not been to a strip club in awhile, I had a blast with clients at Phoenix's most famous gentlemen's club.  $10cover and $10lap dances with friendly, gorgeous, well mannered entertainers made the night go way too quickly.Highlights include a pair of Parisian identical blonde twins and a Brazilian angel who looked like she belonged on the cover of Vogue.

"Best strip club in Phoenix... no contest. Went here tonight after writing strip club reviews all day which sparked a debate among my friends - we decided to check it out since none of us had been here before. And why the fuck haven't we I'm pretty picky and I'll just say that every girl in here is good looking and has a good body. Even the least attractive girl here would be the best looking girl in most other clubs in town. Many of them are downright beautiful.Cover was 8 bucks, there wasn't a drink minimum (but drinks were as pricey as any other club) and dances were 10 bucks... VIP was 20 bucks and wasn't terribly private, but it was nice. My girlfriend got some good dances and we spent our 80 bucks so quick we had to make another run to the ATM before we had even been there an hour. The place has 3 stages and the girls have to rotate to all three which keeps them from being available for awhile and that's kind of a bummer. It's nice though because there's always something to look at. There are a LOT of girls here too, so you won't be sitting there forever waiting for someone to ask you if you want a dance. I was told that the management here was great too and most of the girls I talked to had worked at other clubs but found this one to be the best by far. This place is a little more laid back than other clubs... the girls don't go crazy with the pole dancing - guess when you're hot you don't have to. At first I thought they were just looking bored, but when they come around to chat they light up. This place is more about mingling than watching a show.Bourbon Street blows the doors off pretty much every club in town and even ones in Vegas. If you have the urge for flesh or out of town guests and just want a mellow time with some beautiful girls putting boobs in your face, definitely go here.

"Great place, very hot women, 3 stages for women to dance on so you can move around and check out a diff stage if you want, i was there on a thurs nite so the girls outnumbered the customers and they were all hot. there was also amazing diversity as the girls come in all shapes sizes and ethnicities. the best thing is this is the friendliest place i've been to so far, i saw two old guys chilling with like 5 girls around them and the girl that gave me a dance didnt just shake her ass in front of me like most places, she made it very personal also the girls here are sociable and lastly they give you popcorn lol

"I wanted to give Bourbon St. 4 stars because I take issue with the perception of  ""perfection"" in pretty much ANY establishment, but I could not think of any complaints about this place. Also, of the 5 AZ strip clubs I have been to, this one is the best, hands down.My observations:- Impressive selection of hot girls- Interesting blend of music- Super dark- Good seating pretty much anywhere- Three stages- Popcorn- Tasty drinks- Friendly, concierge-type staffThe best thing for a FEMALE client is the ladies' room is IN THE STRIPPERS' LOCKER ROOM. So you get to see a lot of T&A on the way. For a people watcher like me, this is priceless. Probably my favorite part of going to Bourbon St.

"This is just the best club I have ever been to. The dancers are all professionals, like you wouldn't believe. Sometimes pornstars come work in this club, too. The VIP used to be run by a duo of ladies, and I've never seen a more rotated VIP room. Seriously, it doesn't make sense that the VIP is hosted by men. Think about it. Anyways, the chairs are cushy and oversized. The stage has cool lighting and there are many corners to get lost in. I thought the food was good, too. Crazy!

"Husband and I were out with some friends on Saturday night and decided to hit this place up around 9pm. When we rolled in we were SHOCKED at the $5 cover charge! Who else has it so cheap GREAT START to our evening! :)We easily found some nice seats on couches towards the back but the place is smallish so we had awesome views of the larger stage. It was kinda disappointing with the first couple dancers because they seemed to be more interested in staring at themselves in the mirrors to see how hard they could frown so it got a few doubts going but then some AMAZING dancers blew our minds! Two girls in particular stuck with us for a while and gave us ALL lap dances and did some really crazy tricks on the chairs. $7 lap dances sign us up!!! We all agreed, who needs Christie's $20 dances when we can get gorgeous ladies and great music here! BTW-The music was just FABULOUS! Lots of variety (lil rap not much, lots of rock like Metallica, lil punk) so everyone in our group was rocking out hardcore-in more ways then one ;) Guys, girls, lesbians (we saw a few)-no matter-The Candy Store will take care of you all :D Go get your jelly watch on!!!

"The only thing to not like about this place is that it's small. Really small. I've lived inside of bigger tissue boxes. But that's just an excuse to get extra close to your special lady ;DThe girls here are very friendly, there's a large variety of girls, and a large selection of music. The decor threw me off, but you didn't come in to look at the couches....if you did, you have other problems. I've always had a good time here and recommend this place above all others of it's type in the valley. Female-Friendly dancers are hard to find....well, ones that give mind blowing lap dances are, anyway. I second Carissa!

"Love going to The Candy Store with my Buds. Keep in mind I'm in no way an expert at T&A --- but even I recognized beautiful women when I see 'em! This place has improved over the years and far as female dancers go.$7 lap dances Uhhh...one lap dance long ago was enough for me --  barking up the wrong side of the tree here --- but it was great fun. Girls can jam and do some kewl tricks.Now...I do know about their great Turkey and Top Sirloin Burgers. We often hit this place up for their great specials on Saturdays afternoons. Perfect spot to watch footballs games on the weekends. So overall, I kewl straight buds put up with many of my suggestions for our many of our outings so going to this spot every now and then isn't so bad. Sometimes being a fly on the wall can be fun! :)

"This place was great - we came around 4 pm, so no cover.  Then one of the hotties played about 10 games of pool against me and the boys.  She also happened to be the best dancer we saw all night.  On top of that, overall the personalities of the gals working there was great!  They were all very talkative and fun to visit with.

"Tuesday was girls night so.....no entry fee!This is my second time coming to this place, the first time I was already pretty hammered, so this last time I felt I was sober-er at least enough to cognitively rate this place... and it still gets 5 stars in my book! Being that I've gone to places in the past like ""spearmint rhino"" and other raunchy places I've learned not to expect much out of strip clubs. The girls are usually trashy, look a bit like they're working to feed their drug habit and look like they haven't worked out in months. Yet, THIS PLACE! For 1 am on a Tuesday the girls were beautiful! I was surprised at how attractive everyone was and they were in great shape. Being a female, sometimes strippers get awkward with women, but these girls are friendly and seem genuine. Now the routines... i think a few times I turned my head and said ""how do you hang like that"" this place really validates that stripping should be an Olympic sport. I'm still shocked at how cheap their lap dances are.SIDENOTE:, why do men like to watch you get lap dances you go with a guy to a strip club and they want to buy YOU a dance. I'm fine watching from a distance, thank you.  I just have to awkwardly look like I'm into it while you're getting more enjoyment out of it than . Lets skip me, just buy yourself a lap dance. I'll yelp while you enjoy that for some time. Anyways. Being from California.. I had never been to a topless strip club that serves liquor... YES! Now I can drink while watching girls in white fishnets shimmying up a pole under a black light.. WINNING! God bless you, Arizona liquor laws. I like the loungeseating set up of this place, really comfortable and not too crowded, still have the ability to walk around without side-stepping between people. The bartenders were great. very quick to assist, and friendly. If strip clubs are your thing, check it out.

"Recently had a chance to check this place out. Buddy of mine and I drove by this place and didn't know anything about it.

Not sure on the prices, but lap dances are around $10-20 and VIP is around $300 for an hour. (You can correct me on that)

"Love this place. Its definitely NOT your cheesy megaclub with 100+ girls that swarm you & hound you all night. It's the perfect combination of gentlemen's club meets little local bar. The staff is friendly & the atmosphere is relaxed.  There's a good variety of beautiful dancers: from straight-out-of-a-magazine model types to the curvier girl next door look. Another nice thing about the dancers is they aren't all bleached blonde, big fake boob valley girls: they have redheads, brunettes, blondes, white girls, black girls, Hispanic girls, Asian girls, etc. Sam's is off the strip, across from Chinatown. They have video gaming at the bar. Happy hour drink prices from 7a-7p. Free entry for locals. They don't serve food, but you can ask the waitress or door girl for a menu to have food delivered from one of the nearby restaurants. (Flamingo pizza seems to be a big hit lol) The stage is kind of cool because it has 2 poles. (Some of the girls are pretty good on the pole too). In addition to the couches for lap dances, they have VIP & fantasy room dances too. If you're looking for an off the strip local's-spot type gentlemen's club, definitely check it out.

Hottest chicks, all nude, best overall value compared to other Strip clubs in Vegas which are topless only and super expensive. Went on a Tuesday, and it was awesome, plenty of girls, good atmosphere. They say the lap dances are two for one on Tuesday but it seems all the strippers had their own price, some say $20 for a lap dance others $40. Either way, great experience, fine girls for sure. Will go again next time I'm in Vegas. The only complaint is the cover which is $30 for visitors, and if you get money out of the ATM there it's a $10 fee which is insane so bring plenty of cash.

"http:www.azpuppets.orgAdult Puppet Slam = My favorite thing to do in Phoenix.""Quirky, edgy puppet shows by Arizona's leading quirky, edgy puppeteers.""I've been to the last three Adult Puppet Slams, and they just keep getting better and better.  The writing is intelligent, and the puppetry is as creative as puppetry can get.  Personally, I'm not a big fan of stand-up comedy, especially of the 'dirty just for the sake of being dirty' variety, and these Adult Puppet Slams are right up my alley.  Before my first visit, I expected rude and crude humor (since the shows are 21 and over) and I couldn't have have been more surprised.The shows are 'Late Night with Conan O'Brien' quality, and the theater itself - an old Mormon church - is worthy of a visit just for its architectural wonderfulness.  They serve cheap drinks, the shows are full-feature length, and the lobby doubles as the country's premier puppet museum.Two notes:A) The shows are growing in popularity.  Buy your tickets in advance.B) The Adult Puppet Slams seem to pop up unexpectedly on the theater's schedule.  Visit their website monthly, or else you'll miss the show announcement.

"My work had me bring a group of kids here for a field trip.  This place was awesome.  The old building is well maintained and great to look at.  During the show all my kids were engaged.  The puppeteer held there attention really well and the show was a perfect length for kids.  I actually quite enjoyed the show.  My only complaint was the simple fact that while it is called the Great Arizona PUPPET Theater, I did not see a single puppet.  They were all marionettes.I would have given this place a 4 start review but they came to my site and put on a show for my kids which was extremely entertaining and quite funny (they had puppets this time).  I asked the puppeteer if they had later showings or shows geared more towards adults and she said they did.  I am really looking forward to attend one of these.

"I took my 6 year old daughter here when it was 115 outside and we had nothing to do.   Boy, do I regret not coming here sooner.  It is reasonably priced, the staff is friendly, the show was fantastic, and there was pre-show crafts where we were able to make our own puppets.  The puppeteer was using marionettes for this show (Rapunzel,) and it was neat to see her show the kids how each one of them worked.  She even explained her stage set up and was very interactive with the kids.  After the show, she put the marionettes down to the kids level so they could get a better look and answered all the questions the kids asked.  The architecture here is amazing.  I have read that this historic building was a church and I am not surprised.  It really is a special place.  I will be taking a group of 2 year old kids tomorrow.  I think they will enjoy it just as much as my 6 year old did.

"FANTASTIC!  FYI This review only concerns the Puppet Slam for adultsSkip spending more money for a Harkins ticket and come see the hilariously entertaining and offbeat puppet show! $8 dollars if you reserve them in advance! Acts are all great... some raunchy and dirty... some a bit more indie with a social commentary vibe.  Overall, all really intricate and you can see the work and dedication put into the puppets and staging.  Beautiful.  Best part of all.... the puppet theatre is inside an old MORMON CHURCH... so please drink a beer (or five) and watch frisky puppets telling vulgar jokes.  That being said, the facility is gorgeous... lovely exterior and huge wooden castle-like doors opening into the theatre room. I love that a place like this exists and is a great way to spend a spontaneous Friday night!

They also have guest artists who come in from time to time, if you missed the amazing puppeteer from India who came in you missed an amazing showexperience.Some reviewers are concerned about the rules at the puppet theater, kids have to learn the rules to be good audience members so everyone can enjoy the show!Bring the whole family, have a good time, if the weather's nice you can hang out in the park across the street afterwards. Puppet fans - it doesn't get much better than this.

"I was not sure I would enjoy an adult puppet show but I have to say the evening was a blast. The skits were laugh out loud funny. The building is an historic Morman Church. Very cool. You can enjoy an adult beverage, a glass of wine or beer as you watch the puppet show. Treat yourself to this venue.

"Beautiful building and a real Phoenix treasure. I've been going to their gift shop for years, even when it was still located at DunlapI-17. Lots of gifts and memorabilia from Ireland as well as the various countries of the UK. The main ownerorganizer is very nice and seems to have dedicated his life to bringing the Irish history of Arizona to the people.Went in today to have a gander at the tea selection and two older Irish gentleman were working. It was great to listen to some stories and some Irish language while looking around the shop. Only wish more people cared about this place so that it could grow a bit more.

"What a beautiful addition to the downtown area.  The architecture and stonework make this one of the nicest buildings in the downtown area.

"Oh, this is so much more than a dance education center!  It truly is a wonderful cultural center where you can learn the history of Ireland and its people.  The McClelland Irish Library, part of the Irish Cultural Center, opened in October of 2012 after 5 years of planning. Within the Library is a Genealogy Centre where you can trace your Irish roots, or your Irish-Scots roots, or of any of the other peoples who came to Ireland and settled. www.azirishlibrary.orgPrograms, classes, festivals and exhibitions are offered on a regular basis at the Irish Cultural Center.  Check www.azirish.org for dates, times and details on all the offered services and upcoming events.If you do nothing else, tour the buildings and grounds. It appears to be a small stone building from Central, but when you park and walk through the iron gates you will find you have entered a large complex and another world.Plenty of parking is behind the center.

"While I have been through the Storytelling Centre, I write specifically about the John Knox House attached to and also operated by the Centre.  I have been to the House a number of times and it is truly a gem of history (political and intellectual) specifically focused on Scotland's and particularly Edinburgh's turbulent Reformation era.  Its curator, Dr. Donald Smith, is a treasure house of knowledge about the religio-political currents of that time and if you have any desire to dig beneath the surface of the history of that time in depth I encourage you to arrange a tour with him.  The House and Centre are real gems that the city is lucky to have.

"Stories are magical doors into other cultures and lives. The Storytelling Centre quite literally has magical doors into stories. Children love the little doors in the cafe area which they can open to reveal clips of stories, little dioramas, pictures and artefacts. Then even more magically, the whole wall is a door revealing a storytelling space. The centre offers regular storytelling sessions for all ages and tastes, get their programme and you're sure to find something that piques your interest. Want to tell stories yourself There's lots of training opportunities here too.

"I had to take the time to give this place the credit and thanks that it truly deserves. City Of The World puts on some great things and definitely helps to support the Local Artist in us all. I personally have been renting a spot monthly for First Friday from City Of The World and everyone that runs the Gallery is truly very friendly and wants to do what they can to help you further your opportunities.One of the things I really like about this Gallery is that when you walk around it you see many many different types of art, its not just one artist and one medium. Not that individual showings are bad but I really enjoy the mix of pieces in the gallery. I would recommend taking the time to stop by the gallery and take a look around and to top it off, take a piece of the art on the walls home to help spice up your own place a bit all while helping out a local gallery and a local artist.

"Butterfly Wonderland made our weekend. I love, love, love this place. There's a butterfly theater where you learn about the lives of butterflies via 3D, there's a very cute gift shop, a cacoon gallery where you can see butterflies taking form and of course; the habitat.I've been reading some of the other reviews. Yes of course the habitat is hot and humid, these specific breeds of butterflies are found in the rainforest; other conditions would kill them. Still, I'm positive that even people who aren't either A) cold all the time or B) butterfly enthusiasts will love it. I'm actually warm all the time and I fell in love with the place. Butterflies float right by you, sometimes land on your clothes and flutter in bowls of fruit, flowers and on plants. They are beautiful. It's really calming and amazing to see them so close-up. Two helpful hints for the habitat: A) you aren't supposed to touch the butterflies with your hands, it's not good for them and B) look at the ground when you're walking, some of the butterflies relax down there.There's also a small aquarium area with fish and you can pet a stingray. You can see bees in their natural habitat, ants and scorpions also. It would be cool if they had a ladybug exhibit too!Of course, I bought the limited-time-offer lifetime membership, $100 for lifetime access. I know we'll be back many (many) times. I absolutely recommend this place for a datefamily outingengagement proposalsome-much-need alone time... basically anyone should be able to manage an excuse to go here.

"I found this place out by a group I belong to. I decided to go ahead instead. I wasn't disappointed. The cost is a bit high. $20 for just me. First they take you into a theatre to watch in 3-D the flight of the monarch butterflies then you go into a small room with large windows showing cocoon butterflies coming out of them. There is such wild metallic gold and silver ones but they were not hatching. Just wish the room was bigger because after the theatre everyone is crabbed into this small room. You have a choice of entering the butterfly exhibit or view the hatching. The minute you go into the live butterfly exhibit they land on you. There is so many different species to take pictures of them.  The area gets really humid and uncomfortable so you leave to the air conditioned cafe or to the ant, bee, aquarium  and stingrays. Amazing large aquariums with someone to tell you about the exhibit. I thought this place was very educational and relaxing even with the large crowd.

"This a great place for all ages. We really enjoyed the fantastic 3D video intro about the Monarch butterfly. There are many beautiful butterflies to see up close in a natural environment. Also there is a bee hive which bees are able to go outside, collect pollen, and return. The queen is visible. There is a wonderful aquarium with fish swimming around and touchable! The best!!!! Thanks for co I g to Scottsdale. Anyone want to volunteer there with me

"Thankfully Max wrote up a review for this.  I was writing reviews for the Sig Derb in the MGM Grand reviews.Best game in Vegas....EVER.  Even better than spot the hooker.Two rolls of quarters can last you an hour and a half on a bad streak ($20).  I've hit the 200-1 here twice.  In July 2010, February 2011.  Each was a $1 bet.  $200 profit  Thanks, I'll go blow it all on Craftsteak or head to Mandalay Bay and grab a Surf-N-Turf Burger  Burger Bar (LOBSTAH BUGAHHH!)I have gotten drunk at this game for minimum amounts, I've stayed sober at this game, I've played it with 20+ people surrounding it waiting for a seat on a holiday weekend, and I've played it with 1 other person at the table.Best game in Vegas.......no lie. Note: Last Sigma Derby machine in Vegas.  Thanks MGM Grand for keeping the dream alive.

"I was here three years ago and my friends walked me up and down the strip for an entire week stopping at every casino asking the question of where the heck is the horse game We couldn't find it so when I saw the review on YELP I bookmarked so I could come check it out. It was a TON OF FUN!There is a spot for 10gamers a change machine on site to get quarters and in the 3hours I spent there I only saw 1 empty spot. This is by far the only game Ive seen that gets the players as well as the crowd that gathers so engrossed they yell and scream at the horses like they were at the track themselves.There was a group from Germany there last night and speaking German a little I loved listening to them and watching their excitement. These guys were even making side bets out side of the game and I was just waiting for security to come put a stop to our fun. Outside of the machine breaking down three times in the time I was there we were left alone and it was an amazing time.CHECK THIS GAME OUT ASAP it may end up in storage again soon.

"PLAY THIS GAME. Oops I mean, play this game if you are into good old fashion vintage Vegas fun + camaraderie. The table is located very near the buffet in The MGM Grand.  The rumor is that its the only one left on the strip and one of two in Vegas.  The Sigma Derby table is a place of pure magic, one of the only games that still takes and pays out quarters, each player sits with their own board and bets on which 2 tiny ponies out of five that they think will win. After each race the odds come up and you have 30 seconds to pick your ponies. I have yet to see the 200:1 odds hit, but because of the Derby Magic, its common knowledge that whenever you have the chance you bet the longshot....You don't want to be the only person who didn't! How can you not bet the 200:1 when the amazing oldtimer across from you with his oxygen in yells HORSE TIME! With the Derby comes amazing company like this. As much money as you can sit and lose playing this game, its ALWAYS worth it, and you STILL have a chance to walk away ahead. One night barely paying attention I won 150 quarters and danced my way back to my room with my tiny bucket of coins.You end up sitting for hours with like minded Sigma Derby lovers drinking free cocktails and yelling at five tiny plastic horses. What more can you ask for Find the Sigma Derby the next time your in Vegas, it only takes 1 quarter to get yourself into the game.

"YES INDEED, this is the best game in Vegas...you might have to scavenge for it during the MGM remodel but....but it's SO SO SO worth the stop.

"I'm at MGM right now and it is not in its usual place by the ""win a car slots""It's now right by the Grand Buffet and they moved the Grey hound racing game down by the bar.But both are still at MGM!

"I love this freaking machine!  It's still alive and kickin' (for now) at the MGM Grand, near the buffet.  We played several times, and there was always a lively crowd surrounding this game.I love that you can play with ACTUAL quarters instead of this ""insert at least $1"" crap that most of the other, digitized ""25 cent"" games are pulling now.  Sutton C said it well - you'll definitely develop a sense of camaraderie with the folks around the table with you as you all bet the odds (playing it safe or putting it all on the highest stakes).  I haven't seen anyone ""make it big"" on this machine; mostly everyone who plays seems to just fritter away their quarters slowly, or break even in the end.  There's something so charming about the actual, metal horsies under the glass running the course.  And it's exciting - any pair of them could win each time!  It's impossible to tell at the start who will cross the finish first, and if there is a pattern, I couldn't pick up on it, making this game a thrill every time.I hope it lasts a long, long time!

"I bought Groupons for Unicorn Balloon Company to help my mother fulfill one of the items on her ""bucket list"". I was a bit worried, as I had read a less-than-stellar review, but ultimately, I was impressed by the professionalism of this company. We had no problems using the Groupons and making the reservations a few months in advance. We met the van at the designated time, and they took us to the launch site, checking the air currents for the best launch site. They allowed non-riders to follow to the site, as well. Our pilot, Capt. John Bagwell, was very knowledgeable and personable, telling humorous stories interspersed with ballooning facts. He also took video of the flight, which will be available via e-mail at no extra cost - something most ballooning companies do not do. Our flight lasted about 1 12 hrs., and apparently our chase truck had a flat tire, so was a bit late getting to the landing site (though others in view did not). We did tip on landing, but at the current windspeed, that was to be expected, and the pilot warned us that it would happen. (Note re: previous reviewer: the chase crew does not ""help you land"".) We had a champagne toast and continental breakfast as they presented certificates. A very nice morning, indeed!

"Unicorn Balloon Company took me on my very first hot air balloon ride, and I had an absolute blast!  I opted for the sunrise ride, and despite the very early meeting time (7am in Cave Creek, which is about 45 minutes away from Phoenix), it was completely worth it to see the first glimmers of dawn spread over the desert, splashing pink hues over every surface.We wound up taking off near about 15 other balloons (although this is not always the case) and it was sensational to see all the other balloons speckled brightly against the sky.The basket fits up to 12 people, and though it is a tight fit, it's not uncomfortable and everyone gets a great view.After the ~1 hour flight, the pilot, John, offered up a champagne toast (or OJ for non-drinkers).I felt completely safe from start to finish and simply fascinated by the balloons!PARTING THOUGHT: Must be pretty cool to live in the surrounding area and see the balloons go up every day!

"Yesterday my 2 children and I celebrated my Dad's 75th Birthday with a Hot Air Balloon Ride over Gilbert. It has been my Dad's dream to soar above Gilbert so he could see his home from above. What an adventure we had. Ironically we took off right across the street from my home and soared west towards my dad's. The view from above was spectacular. Shane was our pilot. His professionalism and focus on maintaining our safety. Made our trip a memorable one. Knowing there is no guarantee where the winds would take us, Shane fulfilled my Dad's dream. We have great shots of both of our homes from above!. Thanks Shane for a great ride. I highly recommend Aerogellic Ballooning.

"My best friend and I went on a 5am hot air balloon ride for her birthday last Friday and IT WAS AMAZING. I booked our ride a few weeks in advance with Jessica and was able to get the date we wanted with no problem. The meeting location was easy to get to, Shane, the pilot, was hilarious, knowledgeable, made us feel safe, and the view over Gilbert was phenomenal. I would definitely recommend Aerogelic!

"Woke up extra early to take this balloon flight was expecting to find the balloon already waiting for us that was not the case.  This was the greatest to see how they actually put the balloon together with the basket then we boarded the balloon basket.It was so well done that we were so comfortable and had the best flight thanks to Shane, Sean and Mario.

"Aerogelic Ballooning has always been one of my favorite ballooning companies in the Phoenix area.  I've previously worked for 2 separate broker companies partnering with Aerogelic Ballooning and our customers consistently gave great reviews and never a complaint for this hot air balloon company.  I would highly recommend Aerogelic Ballooning to my friends, family, and even my current boss who lives in Glibert.  He may actually be getting an Aerogelic Ballooning Gift Certificate from me this year for Christmas!  Compared to other hot air balloon companies that operate in the Phoenix area, Aerogelic offers a very personable experience.  With smaller baskets than some of their competition, Aerogelic's balloon rides provide great visibility and tons of fun.  I had the pleasure of meeting up with Aerogelic's owner in Albuquerque where he invited me to dine with his family and crew over breakfast after a morning flight.  The crew is loyal knowledgeable, and always strive for the best customer experience that can be provided.

"Our family celebrated my mother's 80th birthday with a balloon ride.  We wanted to fly out of the East Valley (ChandlerGilbert area).  Aerogelic Ballooning was the only one taking off in this area.  They have a very safe flying record.  Shane's experience, great stories, and humor made this a wonderful flight.  We thoroughly enjoyed our day and flight.  Would recommend Shane and this company to anyone.

"Is there anything that brings smiles to peoples' faces better than a balloon My kids and I have been  watching balloons in the area for the last 4 years. We consider living  in an area that is conducive to ballooning a definite plus!  We have watched many, many landings and I can only say that this crew makes it look easy! Obviously lots of experience and talent here... top notch professionals.   When I look around at those who come to see the landings, everyone is happy... laughing, clapping, smiling. Kids and adults alike want to see and touch the larger than life balloon.  The crew is very kid-friendly. We recently had the luxury of going on a flight and all I can say is AWESOME!  I hope Chandler is still a place for balloons in the future when my 2 young kids are grown.

"These guys rock! I took my whole family on a balloon ride for my Mom's birthday. We did the sunrise ride mid March. The winds were too high on our original day and so we went the next day. The team that helped us were very original and you could tell their love of flight. They were friendly, explained any questions that we had, and took us on an excellent balloon adventure. A great tradition and toast we had on a beautiful morning! The estimated time that was given was spot on for total time to plan for this. Thank you for an awesome memory!!

"My boyfriend and I had a fantastic time up in the sky!! It was my Xmas present and it was so much fun! I thought I was going to be scared to death being lifted off the ground at 100 miles an hour and floating into things.  That totally did not happen. The balloon slowly lifted up and off we went! The landing was also smooth with no complications, although we were forewarn that it could be bumpy if the wind picked up.  It was light and felt like I was on cloud 9 admiring the scenic beauty of our city and desert. Shane was extremely funny and my boyfriend got a kick out of his humor.I read a few of the negative reviews on here, and I'd just like to say, 8 passengers is not overcrowded at all for the smaller basket. Each pocket can easily fit two people that totaled 600lbs from my speculation. My boyfriend and I totaled 370lbs and had plenty of room to move around. So unless you are super obese, I don't see an issue. I would highly recommend them for an experience well done! Thanks!!

"Aerogelic was amazing...while everyone else was ballooning over the barren and bland desert we had an amazing experience over an area where we could see the city, camelback, and tons of cool vegetation and buildings. Our pilots were amazing and talked to is the whole time about ballooning and it's history as well as providing us tons of cool facts about Arizona. They were all very hilarious and friendly and made the experience def. worth it. Got champagne and pastries after we landed at a scenic desert location. Also received certificates and champagne flutes. Got the trip on living social and went with family and friends. Paid $100 but looking back it would definitely been worth paying even twice that. The guys we flew with were Shane, Andy, and Sean...they were all very funny and knowledgable and were def an integral part of making the experience amazing!

"Being that I've only been on ONE ride, i thought this one was good.  This is way below my threshold of fun for the dollar, but it was for my Grandmother's 80th's bday and she really wanted to do it.  Overall, this is one of the cheapest deals I've found.  $130 per rider I believer.  Total of 12 in a basket.  Oh yeah.. 12 in a basket is ALOT.  Our guide was funny, he was really skilled (he split 2 hills) and was very accommodating when it came to telling us about the balloon and how everything worked.Champagne, cheese, and crackers at the end.  With your yelp check in a free champagne glass etched with Rainbow Ryders.  Nice way to commemorate.

"This might be an odd review, because I didn't actually go on a ride with them but I want to give them a positive shout out for solid customer service.  Long story short, I work in media, as does my wife and we each did a story with them.  They were very helpful, and the customers I spoke with were very stoked on the ride and with them.  That's part one.  I was SO impressed I bought a gift certificate with them for a present for my wife.  We had bad luck such as super high winds (cancelled) and emergency surgery ( cancelled) then I had a job transfer out of the area.  We were in a very unique situation and we were able to work it out and I just want to thank them.  A solid group and business...if something goes awry I feel confident they will work with you.  That's it!

"""Flight commander"" Dar was a great balloon pilot for our sunrise trip! Rainbow Ryder's took care of everything from beginning to end. On time. On the ball. It was even interesting to see how they figure out just the right launch point for our navigationless(ish) journey. 12 people in a woven basket, lifted and controlled via propane temperatures and breezes...crazy. We loved the peacefulness from above, while even dipping down low (intentionally) to look for wildlife. After our pretty smooth landing (I was expecting more impact, but was pleasantly surprised), we had a nice continental breakfast with muffins, bagels and scones catered by Wildflower Bread Company. Very good! The champagne, orange juice and cranberry juice could be mixed or served solo as you prefer with comfortable opportunities for refills. Way to go, RR!

"I'm afraid of heights, especially planes. Yet, this was like nothing I've ever experienced.  It was a smooth, floating, and so pleasant. And the staff was so friendly and helpful that it made the whole experience something I'm so glad I just took the leap and did. I took the kids, 8 and 12, and they gave them certificates and pins as a reward for flying. They let my son help put air in the balloon and had the three of us lay flat in the basket while they inflated it until it popped up. It was so much fun -- safe and exhilarating at the same time. I highly recommend this company.

"What a wonderful experience! Wonderful ride, great pilot, and overall very much worth our money. Patrick was our pilot and he was very friendly and informative.

It was nice to finish the whole thing off with champagne and breakfast. I would definitely recommend to my friends and I hope to do it again someday!

"Great experience!  We had Al at the command and he was great in describing the mechanics of flight and making sure we all understood take off and landing.

"A last minute trip to Arizona seemed like an opportunity to check off an item that's been on my bucket-list, namely a flight in a hot air balloon. :) My journey started with a call to ""2FLYUS"" who was fully booked. They referred us to Apex with whom we originally planned to fly the morning after our arrival in Phoenix. However, I ended up losing my bag with my laptop computer upon arrival at the airport and spent the wee hours of the morning trying to locate it. This caused us to be late for our appointment with APEX. They did everything they could to make our situation less stressful while at the same time taking care of their other customers who had arrived on time. They did this by calling in Rollie from Firebird Balloons (which I also give 5 stars). While we didn't actually get to fly with Apex, I felt it important to put in a good word. They made sure we were taken care of even though we were running very late for the flight while at the same time not neglecting their other customers. And they did everything possible to eliminate the stress we were under. The bottom line is they made sure that we were taken care of. This is the mark of service excellence!

"Great experience.   Since this was my first experience with ballooning, I don't have much by way of comparison but we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.  My mother and I were in Phoenix for a long weekend and a balloon ride was on her bucket list. Spoke to Chad on the phone to make the reservation and he was easy to work with.  There were six total passengers on our flight plus the pilot and we had plenty of room - not cramped at all.  We were up in the air for about 75 minutes and had a smooth landing. Jon was great about pointing out sites around town and answering questions.  Would recommend Apex to others.

"Absolutely unforgettable!  My husband and two kiddos went for our first balloon ride today for my husband's birthday.  First off, Jon and Chad were awesome.  They are very knowledgeable and friendly.  It's evident from the first moment that they love what they do and it shows.  We happened to be the only ones on the flight due to it being so early in the season so it was very personable.  Our flight was amazing....we soared at 7,000 feet, captured some amazing views and saw some desert wildlife.  Our landing was the ultimate--it was flawless and we got to land in the street of a residential neighborhood.  The icing on the cake was the champagne & juice celebratory toast at the end.  Jon is an exceptional pilot and if anyone was thinking of ballooning, I would highly recommend them.  You will love it!

"Five Stars!!  Saturday, like many other days, a balloon flew over my son and daughter in law's house while we were enjoying the weather. My sister and her husband were also with us and someone said ""We need to do that"".  That evening we were booked on an Apex sunset flight for Sunday.  To say we had a blast would be an understatement.  Jon (owner and Chief Pilot), Chad (pilot) and Kenny (Chase car driver) could not have made the experience more enjoyable for the 8 of us. We even got in a little night flying. Very highly recommended.

"Best ballooning experience I've ever had! I had been on a sunrise ride a couple years ago with Hot Air Expeditions and decided it was a waste of my money and I never wanted to do it again. Fast forward...my boyfriend had never been on a ride so I decided to book us a flight. I found Apex balloons and wasn't expecting to enjoy it after my first ride prior to this. They blew my mind! Apex balloons and their crew were so great! Our pilot was Jon and our crew chief was Chad; they were both very friendly, outgoing people who made our experience so fun and special! We were able to enjoy a private sunset flight and a nice champagne toast with the crew after. It was a beautiful experience and I'm so glad I found these guys! I will be recommending this business to anyone that shows interest in ballooning! Thanks guys!

"Jon and crew were top notch. They are prompt, well organized, efficient, personable, competent.....my wife and I had a wonderful experience. We would highly recommend their service. They all seem to go above and beyond wanting you to have the best of experiences. Jon, the pilot, is obviously gifted for this work. It seems like a calling for him!

"Initially it was a bit scary to me but once I got used to being up in the air it was a breeze (pun not intended).  I booked the flight for myself and hubs and for a moment it looked as if it wasn't going to happen due to rain coming into Phoenix.  Of all the times!!!  We were called and asked if we wanted to change the date but we couldn't so it was left to see if the original date and weather would cooperate.  They did!Kevin is a hoot which made for a great ride.  Very professional but also fun which helped when I was still nervous.  He explained many things about ballooning and its history and what things we were floating over (beware the jumping cholla cactus) and even told us there was an app for wind currents (which proves there is an app for every thing!). Our ride was a sunrise one and it was amazing to see the sun come over the mountains and watch the other balloons that were also flying that day to inflate and rise. But our ride rocked as his will only carry up to 4 people plus him unlike the others which looked like egg crates full of people - they can carry up to 14 at a time some of them. As it turned out it was just us and Kevin so it was fantastic.  Seeing the world from 5000 feet in the air in a basket is something else!!!!  If you want an experience to cross off your Bucket List or for a special occasion - I highly recommend Kevin.  You will not regret it and like me will want to do it again!

"So fun!! Worth ever penny! The views were amazing and we loved the feeling of floating in the air and seeing all over Phoenix. However, the best part of this company is that the balloon only holds 4 people (plus the pilot), vs 14 people in other companies. It felt like we had our own private tour of the desert.  It ended up to be just me & my husband, we felt so lucky!!  The owner, Kevin, is also the pilot, so he was really invested in making sure we had an amazing flight. This did my disappoint!!  Highly recommend.

"My boyfriend surprised me with a hot air balloon ride for my 25th birthday last week. Kevin and his partner were vibrant hosts and were both very knowledgeable about flying. I thought I would be a little nervous, but the ride was smooth and these guys are obviously pros which put me at ease. Kevin knew the lay of the land well and served as an excellent tour guide. The champagne toast at the end was a perfect treat at the end of our flight. I would definitely recommend taking a trip with Kevin. The other balloons we saw taking off around us were carrying 8-14 people each, and our little basket held two couples and Kevin. I'm very glad my boyfriend booked with 2 Fly Us because we had a more intimate trip--the other couple on our flight was lovely. Two notes: Be prepared to wake up early and the flame for the balloon is HOT! I regretted wearing a nice top because I definitely sweated through it. Goes for any hot air balloon flight, but thought it was worth mentioning.

"We took a flight with Kevin on New Years Eve.  What a great way to end the year.  I would highly recommend 2 Fly Us.  Kevin made this a great day for us.  My wife was a little apprehensive about the flight, but Kevin helped make it enjoyable.  We started out staying rather low so we all became comfortable with flying.  This was a first trip for everyone in the basket.  We worked up to 4000 feet, but found flying at the lower heights to be more interesting.There are several companies that offer flights.  Many of them have baskets that hold 8 to 14 people.  I would recommend using a company with smaller baskets.  ( 4 people plus pilot). We like the smaller more personal flight.  Thanks to Kevin and chaser Gene for a great experience.

"Kevin and Glen were spectacular.  I bought my friend a ride for her birthday and she was gracious enough to bring me along.  It was totally worth it!  The crew was very friendly and extremely knowledgable on hot air balloons.  I was a bit nervous but it was all put to ease because these guys were entertaining and professional.  If I get up the gumption to do this again I will definitely go with these guys. The four person balloon seemed much nicer than those larger balloons, considering it was just me and my friend going.  We met a very nice couple too, that joined us in the balloon.  Kevin's stories were great and he knew so much.  Definitely give these guys a try, it's worth every penny!

"My wife and I have had the opportunity to ride in a hot air balloon a couple of time before out in California wine country and really enjoyed it so when we were looking for something special to do on valentines day this caught my eye especially since Kevin offers a sunset flight (all our other flights were sunrise, crack of dawn affairs where you have to get up at 4 am!)What makes this company a standout is that it is small-just one guy, Kevin, and he only takes 4 people per trip which is so much nicer than the other flights we've been on with 12 or 16.  Kevin is the best host and he's got great stories to tell having flown balloons for over 30 years all over the world (be sure to ask him about Curt Russel and Goldie Hawn in Aspen).We met up about 3:45 pm at the Dunkin donuts rendezvous point and were driven to the launch site-a big open field of state land.  As it was Valentines Day there was a bevy of other balloons with the same plan (the ballon guys are all like one big family) all spread out inflating around the same time but we were the only one of the 15 that wasn't 12 or 16 or even 23 people.  It was great to see all the balloons getting ready and we were one of the first away. Some with the larger crowds were as much as 30 minutes late but all have to be down by sunset (around 630 this time of year).The flight was around an hour then ended with the traditional toast with sparkling wine and he even provided some chocolates as well.  The ride itself was great with Kevin deftly maneuvering the balloon.  Highly recommended!

"Four of us took this hot air balloon ride before sun set for my friend's 50th Birthday. It was affordable compared to other companies, but the basket was a little small. We felt like the red hot burner was very close to our heads, especially when he had to juice it to make hot air. But the experience was wonderful.  Kevin was so funny and entertaining.  He was very competent and experienced which put all of us at ease, especially two people on our flight who are a bit afraid of heights.  His crew was courteous, friendly, and enthusiastic.  After the flight, we had champaigne and cavier (he allowed me to bring my own as it was a special bottle). Kevin took great photos for us too.

"I love you Float. For a scaredy cat like me, I wasn't terribly keen on the idea of a hot air balloon ride, but you guys made it awesome for me. Everyone made my experience so enjoyable. The food was great, they focused on me having the best time that I could, and the amount of people on it was perfect. I would definitely do this again, but I wouldn't use anyone else. You guys are awesome.

"My two sisters and I wanted to take our Mom and Dad on a hot air balloon ride for their anniversary and my Dad's birthday. We had emailed a few of the well known companies in the area and Matt at Float got back to us first. We were glad to hear they had a balloon to fit us 5 plus the pilot, as we wanted it to be a more personal experience. Our pilot, Peggy, was fantastic as was her crew help, Pat.We all agreed it was a great experience, but the most notable part came when we arrived back home and my mom realized she lost three $100 bills from her pocket (she had similarly lost lottery tickets from her jacket the day before). I emailed Matt to see if he could check the back of the van and he responded immediately that he would have Pat check. Sure enough, the money was in the back of the van and he called me back to let me know and to properly get it back to us.Such an honest and classy thing to do and my mom was so relieved (albeit embarrassed). Overall, it was a really nice experience and in good company. We'd definitely recommend!

"I am a 3rd generation Arizonan and seeing hot air balloons rise up from the desert has been a memory since I can remember. 31 years into my life I was finally able to experience balloon flight and I can tell you how incredibly glad I selected FLOAT. Matt, Olivia and their team provided a one of a kind experience, not just in the hot air balloon but before and after from the moment you arrive to fresh Cartel coffee to a seasonally & local curated breakfast and champagne when you land. There's no question that I'll be coming back to FLOAT with friends and family in the future. Thank you tremendously!

"Amazing experience overall! This was my first time riding on one and I can say I had a really good time! The pilot's are great and know how to keep the group entertained. The people I rode with were a pleasure to have on the ride aswell. The meal after the ride was sooo good, it was a nice way to wrap up the ride! I will definitely recommend to friends and family.

"My girlfriend and I took a balloon flight with Float for our anniversary a couple of weeks ago. Both of us had never been on a hot air balloon before. We flew out early on a Sunday. When we got to the meeting site, we were immediately greeted with friendly smiling faces and fresh coffee from a local shop in the area. As we had our morning coffee, the pilot went over our flight plan and safety measures. We felt incredibly comfortable and excited. After that, we got in the Float van and took a beautiful drive through the desert during the sunrise in route to the launch site. While the crew was setting up the balloon they let us help or take as many pictures as we wanted. I got a sweet time lapse video of the balloon inflating! After we took off, the flight was incredibly smooth. The pilot explained everywhere we passed over and also told us hilarious stories about previous flights. My girlfriend brought her go pro with her and we all had fun passing it around the balloon to get good shots! When we landed, we were greeted by Matt and Olivia with a huge brunch made from local ingredients and prepared by a local chef. Before digging in, the pilot told us about the history of hot air ballooning and taught us about the custom of toasting the ride. We all toasted to our first balloon experience with hand picked, freshly squeezed, apple cider mimosas and then had the most delicious brunch! Overall I'd say this was one of the best experiences I've ever had and I would recommend this to everyone! The Float crew made the experience much more exciting than I had expected and added so much more than ""just a balloon ride."" It was a perfect anniversary for my girlfriend and I! Matt, the owner even gave a toast to us! I would recommend Float to anyone who hasn't flown in a balloon before, anyone visiting the Phoenix area, and any locals who want to do something exciting and out of the ordinary in their own backyard. It truly was so much more than just a balloon ride! We plan to fly again as soon as we get back to Phoenix.

"By far, best time I've had in a while. Fantastic, beautiful balloon ride. GOURMET, field-cooked breakfast. Great small-business owners. DO IT!

"My friends and I had so much fun on this tour. The owners were great, the pilot was experienced (and hilarious), and the locally obtained breakfast with champagne toast was amazing! I would definitely recommend Float to anyone wanting to take a tour and I wouldn't go to a different company if I were to go again!

"I'm always a little nervous going to places like this. The same reason I love them--they are geared towards the immigrant community--can also lead to stares that never cease throughout one's meal as the rest of the crowd tries to figure out if you are part of the community somehow, and if not, why did you comeWhen my friend and I first walked in to Cafe Sarajevo, the record skidded off the player so to speak. All the middle-aged Bosnian men smoking at the bar turned around as did the crew of Bosnian teens. Thankfully, the owner quickly saw our timid looks and came over with a big smile and a lot of information and recommendations about Bosnian cuisine. The stares stopped. I ordered an excellent chicken sandwich on this incredibly thick, rich Bosnian bread called Lepinja, while I tried some pretty good Bosnian soda. The portions were huge. Bosnian television played the whole time. For desert, most of the selections available were classical French pastry. In addition to the amazing food, the small cafe also includes a small selection of imported Bosnian goods for purchase. Bosnian food is hard to find even in the New Yorks and L.A.'s of the world, so take full advantage!

"I dated this gypsy con artist chick for awhile who was from Bosnia. She took me here a few times and pretty much blew my mind. I had never had anything quite like it and she assured me it was authentic. From what I understand, you would be hard-pressed to find anything so authentic anywhere else in the US. She even knew the owner (at least I think she was the owner) pretty well. As a tiny grocery store, they have some really fantastic items that I've never found elsewhere. From candy to cured meats, it's all pretty impressive. As a restaurant, the food is great. It's all very rich and pretty accessible for American palates. They serve Turkish coffee which is this pretty amazing mud.Ambiance here is a little third world, but that's part of the experience. I felt pretty welcome, but I was being escorted by an insider. I have found it a little intimidating to return by myself (plus, it's just really kinda far), but as friendly as they are I can't imagine I'd be beaten and dragged into the back or anything... though I don't know why I just thought of that as a possibility. Hmm... I guess it's cuz there's a bit of a mafia vibe here. I can't explain it.

"A couple of nights ago, a friend & I were looking for a place to have dinner, so I headed for Yelp.  Looked in my friend's neighborhood, and found Sarajevo  Saw good reviews, so that's where we went, since neither one of us had ever had Bosnian food.  GOOD CALL!When we walked in, we noticed that we appeared to be the only non-Bosnian people there.  This little nondescript hole-in-the-wall only seats about 20 people.  Our waiter patiently explained the menu and made what turned out to be *excellent* suggestions.  However, the portions were so big, we both took boxes of leftovers home.They weren't busy, so we're a little nervous -- we want this place to succeed, because we want to keep going back for more.I've already recommended Sarajevo to some friends.UPDATE:   My latest visit (last night), I had the Gyro Sammich.  Serious YUM!This time, we we the only customers in the place.  The food is soooo good, and the people are so nice, WHY aren't you Yelpers doing your part  ;-)Go there.  Fill this place up.  Eat.  Enjoy.I have selfish reasons for wanting this Sarajevo Cafe to be full of customers.  No, I don't own a piece of it.  I like the food, and I want to know that it's doing well, so I will know that it's there.  This is seriously good food, people.  Your stomach will tell you that I told you the truth.

"Vegetarians need not apply; the only salad you will find here is a pile of grilled onions!  Seriously, this place is comfort food heaven.  I ordered a chicken sandwich, a large cevapi (which I can only think means ""delicious spicy meat fingers"" in Bosnian) sandwich, a cheese pita, and a spinach pita.  I can't really put my finger on what makes the food so good, other than it's straight up comfort food that sticks to your ribs and makes you wish all pants came with elastic waistbands.The restaurant itself is out of this world; no seriously, it's like walking into some small Bosnian hole-in-the-wall.  What it lacks in amenities it makes up in character; you've got soccer playing on the TV and this 70's eastern European techno playing in the background while a bunch of men chat away in the back of the shop.  The best way to describe it is Star Wars Cantina scene meets National Geographic.  Don't worry about feeling like an outsider, nobody pays attention to the confused and worried look on your face unless it's the gracious and friendly host.  ;)Anyway, back to the food.  The chicken sandwich was perfectly seasoned and cooked, while the meaty Bosnian sausages put Jimmy Dean and his family to shame.  I recommend using the Kobayashi method on these dishes; meat first, bread second.  Oh, and don't forget to ask for some ajvar (tart red-pepper sauce) to dress your sausages with.  The bread shouldn't be ignored though since it is thick, rich, and hearty.  The pitas are not pitas in the Middle-EasternGreek sense, they're more like stuffed fillo pies and they're just as delicious as the rest of the entrees.  By the way, the portions are quite large and make a Hungry Man frozen dinner look (and taste) like a McD's Happy Meal.  Actually, if McD could make their McNuggets even remotely taste like Sarajevo's cevapi, they would rule the world.In all seriousness though, this is simply awesome comfort food at an uber affordable price.  Although I must admit that I was so in love with my plate that I may have snarled and showed my teeth to innocent bystanders who got too close.  Regardless, I definitely recommend this place if you want to try something (as Cheech and Chong would say) that's the same as your favorite comfort food but different.  I would write more but the food coma has completely taken me over.Post Scriptum:  I believe my stomach just did a happy dance and passed out.

"Right on the front window is a gigantic painting of the Bosnian sausage sandwich, and it deserves the place of honor! This is a casual hole in the wall with a small grocery section in the back. Everything we tried was delicious. My husband had the Bosnian sausage sandwich and a cheese pita. I had a meat pita and bean soup. My daughter had a plain gyro, which she pronounced as the best gyro she's ever had. The sausage sandwich and the gyro came on a wonderful fluffy bread that appeared to have been browned on a grill. Next time we go, I'm definitely ordering extra bread! The pitas are not the flat bread sandwiches that you might be expecting. Instead, they are made with a flaky pastry like filo. The filling is wrapped in the pastry and twisted in an oblong spiral shape. For dessert, I had baklava, which seemed to have even more honey sauce and nut filling than most - very tasty!Our server was very friendly and explained the whole menu to us. The atmosphere is homey and there is a notable sense of community that gives you a wonderful taste of Bosnian culture.

"Awesome food! I've been in love with Bosnian food since 2008 when I visited the country, and I was not disappointed at all. It's definitely an immigrant restaurant and any non-Bosnians might feel a but strange at first, but the waiter is super friendly and very welcoming. Definitely check this place out if you are in the mood for something authentic. And for all you posters out that made comments about not finding Bosnian products or authentic restaurants in NY or LA, that's because you aren't looking in the right city. St. Louis is home to the largest population of bosnians outside of Bosnia. Checkout the Bevo Mill area for a large selection of Bosnian restauarants and markets.

"Upon entering, I was greeted warmly with ""Dobar Dan"" (Good Day). I felt taken to another place. What an amazing restaurant! The cevapi is perfect! ...and I will be going back often for Bosnian coffee. Authentic, ambient, clean, quick, friendly, and delicious!

"You MUST try this place. It is wonderful! We shared the zeljanica (spinach spankopita thingy) and the sausage sandwich. Both were amazing. We also had turkish coffee... it blew my mind.

Because I don't want to have to share!

"This is absolutely my favorite restaurant in Montreal. I have been twice now and both times were exceptional. For a fixed price, you get an appetizer, soup, unlimited bread, entree, dessert, and coffee. The prices are beyond reasonable for the amount of (amazing) food that you you get. Food is as good as or better than anything I've had in BostonNYC without the rip-off factor.Both times I had the flank steak, which comes with sauteed green beans and these hashbrown-like crispy potatoes that are to die for. I've also had their mushroom soup and regular dinner salad (which is loaded with figs and some fun cheeses) and both were awesome. The one thing not to miss, however, is the Raclette. Ask for extra peppercorns, you will not be disappointed. I know few things better than a slab of baked, melted cheese on a plate. It's served with a side of gherkin pickles, which sounds strange but the combination is really incredible. I have also had tried their creme brulee and chocolate torte, both fantastic. It's BYOB, which of course always helps keep our wallets happy! And they never judge for bringing a bottle per person :)  The services is always over the top as well. Their menu is in French only, however, staff are always helpful with the translation. The ambiance is beautiful too; it's a small neighborhood joint that is near downtown but not in the middle of the hustle and bustle of everything. It's quiet and outdoor seating is available in summer (and its really cute!) Definitely check this place out; I will definitely be back next time I am in Montreal!

"This place was phenomenal! Had to take a cab from Montreal Centre  to get there, but also accessible by metro.  They speak great English and are very helpful with the menu (they do have an English menu).  We were there to celebrate a 40th Birthday for dinner.  Food was outstanding!  Great ambience and staff extremely friendly and accommodating.  We ordered the raclette  which was divine.  Best meal we had while visiting Montreal! Being able to bring our own wine also made it very affordable.  Love this place and would highly recommend it.

"While on a weekend get-away, we found ourselves at Opus Hotel at the corner of St. Laurent and Sherbrooke. Opus was a Travel + Leisure favorite and they should reconsider -- the staff was uneven: from the Ice Queen at reception to wonderful, accommodating valets. It's clear that the hotel once shone, but now it's scuffed and ratting at the edges.But, this is about Cafeteria, thankfully. The waitstaff at Cafeteria was warm and attentive and the breakfast was well-priced, tasty and well presented. Warm crepes with a plentiful serving of maple syrup. Classic Montreal bagels and a generous serving of fresh, beautiful fruit.Oh, and treat yourself to a bowl of Cafe Au Lait. A glorious way to start any day.

"i just spent a weekend in montreal and had a completely different experience than the majority of the reviewers here.  i did not try their breakfast (although i did stop by during lunchtime one day and it was packed), but i did have dinner here on a thursday night and spent a good part of friday night at the bar.  what i found was the most friendly, welcoming environment that i experienced in montreal.  i'm from austin, tx and we have a laid back, 'let's all have fun' attitude and it was very comfortable to be at Cafeteria.  from the owner to the manager to the waitstaff, this place amazed me with the level of friendly, genuine service they displayed.the pasta dish that i had on thursday was very good.  a light butter and oil sauce over linguini with fresh mozzarella, basil and tomato.  the owner sat next to me and the dish looked so good, i had to order it.  i did and the ladies next to me (a motherdaughter duo out for a drink before planning to get sushi) tried my dish and changed their plans.  they also ordered the pasta and decided to stay there for dinner versus going to get sushi.the bartenders were awesome and the vibe was great.  cool people but also some hipsters.  beautiful crowd on friday night.  really cool and gorgeous people everywhere.i absolutely loved this restaurantbar.  loved it.  felt at home every second i was there, which says something for a texan in montreal that doesn't speak a lick of french.  they were kind and generous and fun and served up the perfect ambience, meal, and drinks while i was there.  i would strongly encourage you to try this restaurant, but also to take the time to say hello to the folks that work there.  they were awesome.  super cool place.  cheers, cafeteria.josh from texas

"I love this restaurant - one of those great little secret places that I always enjoy being. It has a very Montreal atmosphere (lots of black, cool music, comfortable seats), and great food. It's not large, but you can usually find a seat. It's also one of my favorite afternoon meeting places. Right on Blvd St. Laurent, it's a convenient place to meet with colleagues and have an amazing coffee or a beer.  In warmer weather you can sit in the window and watch the street go by.  Week-end brunch is good too.. love the little sausages.  Highly, highly recommended.

"After calling about 10 places at 9pm on a Saturday night trying to get reservations for 9 people an hour and a half later, Le Continental was the first place to hook us up with a large ad hoc reservation.Some of us arrived earlier than others so we could savor a drink first - my friends were happy with the staff's wine suggestions, and I thoroughly enjoyed my cosmopolitan.Since none of the 9 of us spoke a lick of french, receiving a french menu in a french restaurant we were trying to discern what exactly it was we were looking at in terms of food.  The handsome, good-natured waiters brought us out some english menus, and though people ordered a wide variety of food items - the lamb, the duck, the steak frites, the flank steak, apps of calamari, figs, and beef carpaccio, all of us were extremely pleased with how tasty everything was, as well as how reasonably priced it all was (save for the Canadian tax, which is shockingly high, so it winds up evening out to still solid American pricing).  We all split up desserts - I had one of the largest creme brulees I've ever seen, and some other folks got the house layer dessert.  We ate dinner from 10:30pm until 1:00am, never felt rushed, and the best part was that they had already split up the check for our large party, even with distinctions of half-desserts on each bill for those of us who had split them!Le Continental may not have been the first place we called or even that 9th, but my cosmo, flank steak, and creme brulee were all extremely delicious and even after tax and tip I only had to shell out $42 Canadian at this ritzy jam.Highly recommend to anyone touting around Montreal - they were great to our large party - accommodating, sweet, and the food was totally worth it.

"We  went to this place because we didn't make it for our reservation at Au Pied de Cochon. Saturday night traffic in Montreal was really bad coming from Vieux Port de Montreal after Cirque du Soleil show. On the other hand the restaurant is not within walking distance from our hotel, Le Centre Sheraton. It was 12:15 when we arrived at East Duluth and Au Pied De Cochon kitchen closed at 12AM. We found that the only restaurant that still open was Continental Bistro. Both of us don't speak french but our waiter was friendly and spoke english well. I ordered Duck confit (one of my favorite) and my friend ordered lamb shank. Both of them were delicious. For desert we ordered desert du jour to share. It was raspberry and white chocolate tart. We ate at two different French restaurant and this one was the best. Unfortunately they don't open for lunch. I want to order duck confit again before I leave I highly recommend this restaurant. Surprisingly not many people write review about this place.

"I often forget how big of a fan I am of this place until some random Thursday night when I'm looking for a classic place to eat something fresh and guaranteed yummy. Then I remember of all those late night after work snacks I've had and enjoyed there.This is the perfect little bistro. Well located, cute setup, and funaffordable wines for you to try. I think they've narrowed down their food menu lately, but the good news is, they  kept the best dishes.So the beef carpaccio with manchego and the salmon tartar with avocado puree are great. BUT make sure you order the fig carpaccio served hot with goat cheese and the most amazing creamy pesto and balsamic sauce ever. Everything on the menu will be good, but keep your focus on the fig carpaccio - it will be AMAZING.I will admit that the bill can get a little high but the food is delicious and worth it. Plus, they're open late and have a cute (yet tight) terrace. You should go!!'

"You'd be forgiven for walking straight past the entrance to this place, tucked down a flight of steps just off George Street, but in my opinion that's half of it's charm. It's popular and highly-regarded without needing to shout about it; people know about it because of the quality, not because it's in your face.It's easy to see why. When you step inside it's like being on some sort of Japanese garden terrace, with the green leafy plants and water feature. Rick's pay great attention to detail: every table has a copy of that morning's newspaper neatly folded on it, next to the fresh flowers, and the service is efficient without being annoying and intrusive.Although it's never going to make the Top 10 list of cheapest places in Edinburgh, you do get what you pay for. That said, at the moment all of the Montpeliers venues have their ""Better By Half"" promos on: glasses of house wine, selected cocktails, selected beers and even champagne by the glass are all half price at the moment. I've been making the most of these offers every time I'm out for fear that they might finish soon, but despite my panic-drinking it seems they're here to stay for a whie yet. Happy Days.I've only ever drunk here, but one of these days I will be going for food... the plates I've seen being carried to other tables do look and smell gorgeous. There are always enough people in here to give the place a nice buzz, but never enough to make it the kind of busy where service starts to slump and the temperature goes through the roof.

"In the last 6 months Ricks has definitely had a good shake up, and after my fantastic experience last week I think things can only get better. The bar team are innovative and original and during a busy Friday night shift never failed to impress me as I worked my way through the new cocktail list! And the bar snacks were unique and delicious! The DJ provides a funky relaxed atmosphere and gradually builds up the beats to get you in that weekend mood! I will be back again and again and will be taking all my friends too! I recommend a passionfruit frozen margarita or 'busy with the fizzy' strawberry soda stream cocktail! Just fab!

Thistle Street is one of my favourite eating and drinking districts in Edinburgh, and this place only served to increase my adoration.Overall, we said: ""Iris offers extremely high quality food, in swish surroundings, with excellent, friendly, knowledgeable service. The only other person I've heard extolling its virtues is ardent Yelper Jurgen, who is a great fan of the place. I'd like to confirm that I will be joining Jurgen's chorus of appreciation, as the place is something really very special. It shines bright in a street of precious Edinburgh jewels. I'd suggest you pay it a visit soon. You will be richly rewarded.""

"Excellent Michelin starred restaurant, with friendly service and wonderful food. Get a seat near the window where you can watch the chefs do their stuff.Tom Kitchin isn't afraid to be adventurous in his mixes of flavours, which often delivers a whole new taste treat, but (on the rare occasion) strikes an odd discordant note on the palate.Local produce always fresh, especially fish.

"This is one of the best 1-star michelin restaurant I have been to. It's a full experience, food and watching the cooks at work. There is indeed a big window into the kitchen that lets everyone see what's going on and grasp the electrical atmosphere in the cooking chamber. The table are organised so that most people can peep in during their meal, and appreciate the effort put into their food. It's really cool to see Tom Kitchen put the final touches to your plate :)) It just makes the whole thing more exciting!The food itself is wonderful. Really incredibly fresh and tasty. Seasonal and imaginative. We went for lunch and the 30-ish pound menu is cheap compared to the quality of the food. Quite a treat if you take some wine, but nonetheless worthwhile and to be remembered. I started with a pistachio, rabbit & foie gras terrine with an onion tatin. Just AMAZING! Then I had pork cheeks cooked like a ""blanquette"" with a white sauce, mushrooms, carrots, new potatoes. Delicious. The meat was so tender. Then I had the rhubarb-themed dessert: rhubarb fresh soup with poached pieces of rhubarb, rhubarb sorbet, caramel croquante, pannacotta. I really really liked it. So yummy. And we had the traditional petit-fours after that. Yum!The restaurant is a little remote and far from the city centre, but it's ok. It's just in front of the Scottish government building. Quite surreal actually.

"I would say, at a push, my favourite restaurant in Edinburgh... When you can afford it :) Been for dinner and lunch and both times it was first class. It's not an overly fussy place considering the Michelin star but focuses very much on the quality of ingredients, with the dishes being far more simplistic than say 21212. This is to its credit, however, and Mr Kitchin thoroughly deserves his recent title of best restaurant in Scotland.If it's on the menu, the turbot with sea snails was stunning and one of the most memorable dishes I've eaten. If you don't fancy forking out for the a la carte or tasting menu, the set lunch is excellently priced and provides close to the kitchin experience whilst putting a smaller dent in ones purse!

"They take great care of you from the start. And by the start, I mean enquiring about seating by email. The hostess is prompt and complete with replies, letting me know which nights are fully booked and advising me about better days to come in. I came here for lunch since all the dinners were booked up and had the prix fixe 3-course lunch. Really a steal in my opinion.The waiting staff worked as a great team so we didn't feel ignored even when our server was helping someone else as there were many other friendly staff checking on each other's clientele. I loved having sweet potato chips at the table to crunch on when we entered and the selection of bread from a wheeled up bread cart with selections such as freshly baked sourdough and olive bread.My starter was the octopus carpaccio which was fabulously laid out and accompanied with colourful pickled vegetables. The main was the ox cheek which was so delicate that no knife was necessary. Dessert was a chocolate pistachio souffle which was very creative and interesting. Not too heavy but nice and warm with a great flavour.The hosts took care of calling our taxi as we exited to proceed with our day after, with hunger satisfied and tastebuds delighted.

"Wow, Kitchin blew me away. The dining room was elegant but still bright. Service was very friendly except for the French staff who were sterile and highly efficient yet still professional as can only expected from a French server. The most refreshing part of Kitchin was actually seeing Tom Kitchin in the kitchen with his hands in the food; there is a small window that allows you to see into the kitchen from the dining room. It is becoming increasingly rare to see a chef in the restaurant that his name on it. Veg crisp were giving as snack. A great selection of bread was also served. The amuse bouche of pumpkin soup with crunch pumpkin seed in it was very wintery and was more than just one small bite.  I was a bit weary of the Pig's Head and Langoustine because I was not sure how the Langoustine could add to this dish. Trust me something would be missing it wasn't on the plate. The pig's head was boned and rolled and had a great earthy spice to it. My main of venison was cooked perfectly and had seven components on the dish. Any time I see many components on the dish I get nervous. But Kitchin surprised me again. This was a pretty hardy winter dish for a restaurant in this category. (I left really full) My desert was simply titled Chocolate and features mall souflee, ice cream and blood orange marmalade the made everything else taste so much better. When I told the staff I was from Boston I was invited into the Kitchen to meet Chef Kitchin and he also signed a copy of his cookbook for me. This guy seems really down to earth. My 55 review is based off the food I ate and not that I met the chef.
",1
"So glad I came here with my family. I am not a big fan of haute cuisine anymore, too much showing off and combining of strange flavours, for me, so I was a bit apprehensive.The Kitchen shows that you can take cooking to a higher level using local ingredients, keep the flavours individual and still have Michelin star food.I thought the costs were very competitive for the quality and would highly recommend anyone going for any occasion.

"There are as of right now three items that stick out to me that have eaten as the most memorable three things.  One was here at The Kitchin.  My wife and I recently visited Edinburgh and this was the best meal we ate.  Two start I had the bone marrow, I love bone marrow and would swim in it like Scrooge McDuck swims in money if I could, this marrow was much less traditional than the ones I have had in NYC.  It had snails bacon and a quail egg on top, it was fantastic.  For my main course I had mutton, the dish came with a small side of braised shoulder meat, it was fantastic, and I wish I was eating right now. The main part of the dish was very good too, just not as memorable.  It is worth the schlep to leith to eat here for sure.
",1
"HOLY CRAP THIS PLACE IS AWESOME.Food, wine, service (even the French staff) - all fantastic!Did the tasting menu with matching wine and we were happily stuffed full of food and rolled to a waiting taxi (after meeting Tom) at the end of the night. Small things like a map from where in the country produce was sourced and a copy of the tasting menu itself were nice little touches which weren't required but definitely welcomed.Definitely coming back.
",1
"The kitchin is a must if you are in Edinburgh. Having seen Kitchin on masterchef, I was intrigued. Everything on his menu is sourced from Scotland, and they even bring you a little map of Scotland in the beginning showing where the ingredients were from. Presentation and food were beautiful - full of color and much thought to the dishes. Fortunately it was grouse season when I was visiting (October 2013) so I tried it for the first time as my main dish. It was fantastic- cooked perfectly and juicy, I don't know if I've ever had anything better. The ceps starter was amazing as well - perfectly seasoned to bring out the taste of the mushroom. The berry tart dessert was a great way to end the meal. The best part was at the end when tom himself came out to introduce himself to us. Even though he's become well known, he really seems like a down to earth kinda guy. The whole time I also noticed he was in the kitchen with food preparation and making sure everything was perfect. I wouldn't hesitate to return, I had an outstanding experience.

"TLC Care Center gave me back my life ! I have been here over a year and plan on going home soon. I have received great care from my doctors, nurses, and the staff here. The physical therapy folks are the best ! God bless you and thanks TLC !!!

"My mother has been at four different rehab centers in Las Vegas over the past 1 12 years...and for the last several months, we have been at TLC. We could not be happier with the service, staff and environment. There is always a doctor on staff, which is very hard to find in a rehab...the nurses are very knowledgeable, courteous and attentive...and have been dedicated to giving my mother consistent attention. I would highly recommend this facility to anyone who deeply cares about where their loved one is placed. We can't be grateful and thankful enough.

"If you need rehab, this is a great place to go... friendly staff that know what they are doing.  They helped me get full movement back after hand surgery and now I'm going to see them for another injury.  They work with all kinds of athletes and injuries... There is always a lot going on in the building, but they manage to treat all of their clients in a timely  manner and have great customer service!

"This is a gym goer's gym.  Serious people only; not your Fufu trying to pick up on someone, I can't get away from looking at the mirror, hey what's your name gym!You need to get your ""donkey"" back in shape you come to Rehab Plus.  No bull!  Warren and his boys will get you working and performing at a new level.  I got killed climbing the ropes.  I didn't think much of it, but how dare I underestimated it!  My arms were so weak and tired in the end.  My hands.....well let's just say calling them raw is an understatement.  I don't recall how many times I climbed that rope and did pull-ups, but yeah it was hell of a workout.  That was just my first time too!  Can't wait to go back........hahahaha!  I laugh because I just realize how ridiculous this is!  Here I come Tough Mudder!  The gym doesn't have all the high tech equipment.  You want that; go to a gym where they offer manicures!  Suck it up and welcome to hell!  Basic equipment, but very innovative technics and training.  They have an artificial turf area and a free weights room where looking at it makes you feel a lot bigger.  Are those really my biceps -- wink!

"If your new to exercise and want to learn the SAFEPROPER ways to get involved or a bonafied ""gym rat"" it doesn't matter. Simply put, Rehab Plus is the place to go in order to not only reach your fitness goals the right way, but obtain the knowledge and motivation to surpass them. Rehab Plus is NOT the huge corporate gym with run of the mill trainers only interested in hitting on chicks and making money. Every staff member not only has the education but the passion and interest in exercisefitness you want to from your trainer to keep your workouts fresh, interesting, and the body improving. Its not just for the adults either. If you want to get your kid off the couch or give your young athlete that serious leg up on the competition, Rehab Plus will take them to that next level with fun and fresh workouts. Rehab Plus has all the equipment you could wantneed to get that amazing and unique workout in. Climbing rope, weight sled, artificial turf area, kettle balls you name it. In my opinion its not the equipment that makes the work out, it's the knowledge and creativity of the trainer. I workout in some form 6 days a week (1 if which  Rehab Plus) and the only day I consistently get that ""good"" soreness is when I go see my boy Dan at Sports Rehab. He always has new and challenging exercises that keeps my body guessing and avoiding that dreaded plateau effect. Not only that, but the exercises I learn at Rehab Plus allow me to keep my own workouts fresh and interesting.Not to worry Dan isn't the only trainer at Rehab Plus. He's just one of the amazing trainers there and they all have their own areas of expertise. From former NFL players and strength coaches to elite level swim coaches, Sports Rehab has a trainerprogram for everyone. It doesn't matter if your 50 trying to get that 30 firmness back or want to get your young athlete to the next level, Rehab Plus knows how to do it right! The abundance and range of expertise of the trainers at Rehab Plus would even allow you to go in there with your kid and both get a workout in at the same time! I don't think any other gym could offer that.It doesn't stop at the exercisefitness level. Rehab Plus is also sports physical therapy center that isn't just worried about the minimum. Dedicated to getting the athlete back on the field, court, board, slopes, whatever your sport they have the education and put their knowledge to use when it comes to getting you back to your top performing levels. I only wish I had a place like when rehabbing my torn knee. I will definitely use Rehab Plus for any services they can offer me in training or rehabbing injuries.

"I tried Rehab Plus out after injuring my shoulder and I really can't say enough great things about the place and staff.  Throughout my baseball career including: high school, collegiate, and semi-professional, I thought that I had experienced what I thought was some of the best rehabilitation and training in the country, but after visiting Rehab Plus I was wrong.  From the first time I went in to the last time, the staff was very knowledgeable and very supportive in helping me get back to full form.  The trainers and Physical therapists at Rehab Plus are second to none.  After only about five sessions of doing unique strength, rehab, and stretching exercises I had already felt ten times better.  Being an athlete my whole life I have always been a huge believer in positive thinking and having a proactive attitude.  I can tell you first hand that the personnel at Rehab Plus share this fundamental belief.  The atmosphere at Rehab Plus is very supportive and positive created by the trainers, physical therapists, and residual staff.  A couple of things that give Rehab Plus an edge over similar places is that the personnel are progressive and are so well versed in their areas of expertise.  Many places I've been to in the past are stuck on old philosophies that don't get optimal results.  Rehab Plus strives to be the best by catering to the needs of their clients such as: rehabilitation, sports performance, strength and conditioning, and much more.

"I want to learn the DEADLIFT with proper form, for the fun of it. Today I had an almost two hour evaluation and preliminary training with Ethan, tonight I have early onset rigor mortis (and we still haven't touched a bar). I'm so impressed I can barely stand it. Yesterday I questioned if I'd ever DEADLIFT 400 pounds at age 54 with very little experience under my belt. Today that 400 pound dead-lift is in my sites. Ethan's training, experience  knowledge, and encouragement are awesome.Now I know why putting down the bottles to pick up the barbells would be worth it. Sober people can get really strong.I've watched a lot of free training on YouTube and from other online resources, but the connection between the mind and the muscles when the trainer is right there is incomparable in value.I've got a lot of work these next four weeks before my next visit!

"This place is great! Smart, effective Physical Therapy. They are seasoned, sports minded therapist. They're focused on service and getting you back to the level of activity that's important to you!Sad to say, I've seen a lot of PT over the years. The atmosphere here is the best! It has a very down to earth, professional vibe. It's all about recovery. My doctor recommended I go to rehab associated with his practice. But it seemed too sterile. A friend recommended Rehab Plus for his successful recovery from knee and IT Band problems. My hip and knee arthritis was keeping me off the court and day to day activities were painful. My therapy regimen included basic strengthening and sport specific exercises that improved my game.Someone's with you at all times to ensure you're doing the right thing, working with proper form. They're attentive, enthusiastic and patient.I highly recommend Rehab Plus!

"AAT card, health card, sheriff card, gaming card, green card and a visa card to pay for all the other cards, I'm getting carded to death! But all this cards are required by law at my work so there's no way out.  There are about 3 or 4 certified schools in Nevada where you can obtain this card, you have to attend the three to four hour class depending on the school and pay the 20 to 40 dollar fee, again depending on the school. By far this is the best place to obtain the card the instructor is very knowledgeable on the subject and very understanding with the students. The price of the card is only 20.00 dollars. The class is very easy and the only way not to pass the class is if you come to the class drunk and that would be funny  because that would mean that you needed the class the most. You will learn that drinking alcohol causes drunkenness, and will receive a card to prove that you actually know that. The hardest part would be to stay awake.

"A friend with severe back pain introduced me to Dr. Randall over a year ago. He had worked on her through adjustments and therapy for years. After having a major issue with my back and visiting other chiropractors with no relief, I also went to Dr. Randall. I wasn't so keen on the neighborhood he's in, but the prices are good and he is the BEST! He's a small business owner that doesn't want to be big or have massive overhead to pass along to clients. Dr. Randall is an awesome chiropractor!!!! My entire family and all my neighbors go to him routinely for adjustments to prevent any major issues.
",1
"I noticed that the earlier reviews were from Dr. Randall's former location. The new location is really nice and the new massage therapist ,Keri, is one of the best I've encountered. Dr. Randall is the most knowledgeable, personable and lol good looking Chiropractor I've visited, so i stuck with him. I think it's so important to have a good relationship with a Doc, and one that really will talk to you about your spinal, neck, hip etc. issues. Obviously, this guy knows his stuff. I can't believe the difference in my shoulder and neck since I've had regular visits.  I don't have insurance, but his visits are only $35, and that was as much as my co-pay used to be! The new massage therapist is actually a neuro muscular medical massage therapist, and you can't believe how the combination of massage and chiro adjustment has changed my overall health. I'm 55 and don't have any pain. Thank you Doctor Randall and Keri! I'm finally a believer.

"Dr. Randall is a very experienced chiropractor, he is very good reading the spine and pointing where the problem is. He has physical therapy area, massage therapy room and massage therapist by appointment.  Dr. Randall adjustments helped me to get more balance in my body, walking, sitting, even sleeping.  I would definitely recommend Dr. Randall.

"Jim is the best masseur I have ever seen. He's very knowledgeable in his massage techniques and in muscle release. I had a lower back problem for several years and his sessions helped reduce my pain and eventually make it go away completely. He excels at finding the tense places in the neck shoulders and hips and releasing them. He's a great sports massage therapist, and knows deep tissue, trigger point, and cranial sacral techniques. The combined styles he uses works better than any one massage technique I've tried in the past.  He's very flexible with scheduling, and works late nights so when I can't make it in the evening I can usually get my massage at night. Though he does out calls, I always went to him because he has a spa next to the massage room that I can relax in and warm up before he works on me, which makes the massage much more effective and gives quicker results.

"I have been going to Jim for over a month now. I have had several other massages here in Vegas, but Jims is by far the best yet. I always book 90 minutes in the mornings at his home and leave there floating away. I have back and shoulder problems and Jim knows exactly what to do and how much pressure to give me. He even adjusts my back when necessary. I get a weekly massage from Jim and it is worth it. I look forward to his warm hospitality and jokes every Friday. Keep up the excellent work.. MIKE (QNICKS)

"The first time I came to get a massage here.. I was in serious pain from a sports injury. My right shoulder blade had shooting pain all the way down to my lower back.. and it lasted for days. It was affecting everything I did on a regular basis. I just couldn't move properly or even think clearly as the pain was so intense. I was nearly in tears at one point and I even had to go to work with this pain... it was not a happy time..lol. A friend referred me to 702Massage.Com and I went as soon as I could get an appointment. I explained my problem to Jim,  and we got to work on the solution. The session I had was the perfect combination of massage and adjustment of the muscles that were out of whack and partly responsible for the pain.I was in a bit more pain than I had ever been in and Jim really fixed me up right. I never had a chiropractic adjustment before, and I never had a treatment that set me feeling as right as this one did. I would highly recommend 702Massage.Com to anyone in a similar situation, or anyone that just needs to loosen up!

"My Back was so tight and painful I could not sleep for over one hour at a time before waking up from the pain. I went to a Chiropractor years ago, however though maybe a Sports Massage first would help.Jim works with the UNLV Swim Team, The Rugby Championship Tour recently held in Las Vegas, the Professional Bull Riders and many more.His many massage techniques were custom tailored to my problem. It was Incredible and after the first visit I felt my back relaxing from the stress I put on it. He has made a huge difference on my back and saved me from expensive Doctor visits. There is a Hot Tub available to warm you up prior to your massage.  Note: It you're looking for a spiffy lobby, Silk Robes, Juice Bar, etc.. this is not for you. If you are wanting a legitimate Great Massage at a reasonable price - This is the Best !

"First, let me say that I am not someone who would normally go to a house for in-call massage, nor am I into the idea of having a male massage me, but I needed someone with the strength to correct my back issues.    That being said, Jim's excellent reviews, history as a sports masseur, and very fair pricing overcame my initial objections, and let me say, I am glad they did! Jim provided me an excellent 1 hour deep tissue massage.  He also helped adjust my lower back to assist with the sciatic nerve pain.   He was also kind enough to provide me tips to help avoid future pain issues.  Jim is centrally located in Las Vegas (only 7 minutes east of the strip), professional, courteous, and talented!  You can really tell he loves his work and loves helping people.  I will be back for sure!

"I have really, really hard neckshoulders.  They are rock solid and are usually located somewhere around my ears.  I have a high stress job and I have gotten stress headachesmigraines.  It is necessary for me to get regular massages to keep my headshoulders from taking over my entire skull.  I used to go for spa massages when I was younger, but now that I am older (read: middle aged), frou-frou massages just don't cut it.  I need muscle, elbow grease, someone who is physical and has expert knowledge of the musculoskeletal systems of the human body.  Enter Jim.  My husband found him through Yelp.  I was a little nervous when we scheduled an in-room massage.  He arrived on time.  He was so pleasant.  He worked on me first, and then my daughter.  I have never *ever* had a better massage.  (And I am a massage whore -- I had them both before and after Jim.)  Jim spoke to me to find out my specific needs, and then he got down to business.  I could tell by the way he poked and prodded me that he knew what he was doing.  The way that he moved my limbs about so that he could access the muscles underneath -- that is artistry.  He did some quasi-chiropractic moves -- adjustment, releases, etc.  After me (round and fluffy) he worked on my skinny minny daughter.  She was likewise satisfied (so he must have adjusted his touch so that he didn't break her bones).  The results from Jim's massage lasted a good month -- far longer than ever before.  I will see Jim each and every time I go to Vegas -- if I even get within 25 miles of Vegas.  Thank you, Jim, for raising the bar for my massages.  You truly are the best and I will never forget you.  (If I sound sappy, let me tell you that this is the effect of Jim's massages!  He's THAT good.)  p.s.  His prices are more than reasonable.  Don't waste your $ on a hotel massage.  Go to Jim and use your $ on a facial or something.

"Well, Its been over a year and I still go to Jims for a weekly massage. He knows exactly what to do and what to fix when I am hurting. I always get  the 90 minute massage and when its over, I'm like, already....  LOL..Everyone, please let this man massage you. You can't go wrong with that great discounted price...  A++++++

"If you are looking for the best masseuse in Vegas, Jim is the person. I had the worst knots that had escalated so badly that it was giving me migraines and Jim was able to get them out and give me relief.  He is so knowledgeable about the body, more like a physical therapistsports medicine masseuse.  His prices are so reasonable and less than half of what you would pay for a mediocre massage at any hotel spa. On top of all that, he is the nicest person you'll ever meet.  I've had bad massages from people who just don't enjoy what they do and you can really feel it.  Jim is so passionate about what he does and really cares about how you are feeling.  He runs his business out of his home (actually in a cozy, air-conditioned villa outside on his patio) and I think some people may be reluctant to try him out because of that, but once you try him out, you will not be able to go anywhere else!  But for those that are still afraid to try...no problem.  Leaves more open slots open for all of us that know how good he is!

"OH MY GOD! I'm 5'9"" 246 lbs. Im a RN so im always on my feet. I lift weights and never stretch so needless to say I'm tight all over and have many knots. Having gotten 2 massages a month at countless different places asking for ""deep"" tissue, Jim was THE ONLY ONE to really get into my overworked never stretched muscles. He cracked my back aligning it. My headaches went away. I don't get cramps in the middle of the night. Instead of getting a massage every other week this will now be my weekly routine and only with Jim. I HIGHLY recommend Jim for ur massage needs.

"I was in Vegas on business and had read this guy's reviews.  I could not believe someone would do this good of a massage for such little money, but figured I might as well give it a try, what else did I have to lose  I'm a bodybuilder and try and get a good deep tissue at least once or twice a month.  In short, his work is nothing short of incredible.  It was the toughest deep tissue work I ever had and the effects were long lasting.  He is able to reach muscle attachments that no other therapist ever has.  If you are looking for a terrific deep tissue man, he is your guy.  The place is nothing fancy, he works out of his house in a clean private room behind it.  He deserves all those stars!

"Functional Performance Center is a clean, large physical therapy facility. I went in for back issues that I have had for years and the physical therapist Shelley was able to help me. I have gone to chiropractors for years, but have not seen anything but immediate relief, however, with no improvement. Shelley not only taught me more about my bodymuscles and how they work together, but showed me proper technique when stretching and doing certain exercises. I have also met with the other therapist Derek Steveson and he does exceptional work as well. He is certified in more than just physical therapy, and you know immediately that he has had many years in the field.  Everyone is very friendly, and the front desk assistants were very helpful in helping me schedule my next appointment. I will continue going here for physical therapy. Not only is it a good workout, but I enjoy the atmosphere and the people who help me.

"Went in for a pulled leg muscle.  The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable.  They have a large therapy room with a lot of sports specific equipment.  They were thorough in examining my leg and even noticed my ankle hadn't healed right from a break 15 years ago.  I would highly recommend them to anyone in need of PT.

"Functional Performance Center is an amazing place.  There is a reason their clients range from professional athletes to senior citizens... they know what they are doing.  I was physically unable to walk after my injury, and despite my doctors prognosis, I am able to run today.  Physical Therapy is NOT as easy as taking a pill.  You get out of it what you put into it.  That includes giving constant feedback to your therapist as you continue your therapy, so they can monitor your progress.  I was asked every session about my painsprogress and my tasks were always adjusted accordingly.  Without this team I would be considered handicapped today.  I have recommended the FPC to my friends, and they were also very satisfied with this business.  I will continue to recommend them to anyone of any age looking for physical therapy.  Their staff is professional, friendly, and talented.  Best place in the Valley for PT, hands down.

"I went to the clinic to prepare for a meniscus operation...had a great experience and my recuperation was very easy and shorter because of my preparation.  I then did physical therapy with Derek Steveson and my knee has responded with skiing, hiking and tennis.  I have a tear in my other knee...and because of my program, I have not had to have the surgery.I highly recommend the good Doctor!

"Dr. Luster is fantastic. He has been great for the whole family. My kids let him adjust them and even my wife. She has always been a skeptic. After recovering from surgery she was struggling with pain during her morning run. Dr. Luster was able to quickly diagnose and fix the problem immediately. He loosened up a muscle and adjusted her and she was immediately feeling better. The following morning to her surprise, she was able to run pain free in contrast to the previous weeks of consistent pain. Needless to say she needed no more convincing and trusted Dr. Luster with all of her running needs especially race recovery and injury prevention.

Dr. Luster is amazing, he made me feel better in just a few minutes!I made the appointment because I've been suffering from migraines for decades and they were increasing in frequency and pain. Dr. Luster treated me, which gave me instant relief from a migraine. During my time with Dr. Luster, he developed a plan of treatment, gave me numerous daily exercisesstretches and he provided me with nutritional options. Every time I see Dr. Luster he proves that cares about getting me better and preventing my painful migraines. Thank you, Dr. Luster; I highly recommend you to all of my friends and family in need.  I was also pleasantly surprised with other services available at Clarity Chiropractic such as; weight loss treatments, wrinkle reduction and my personal favorite Lipo-light (I can't wait to try that!)

"I had a backache in my mid back that wasn't going away.  I couldn't take full breaths.  I had to hunch a little because sitting up or walking straight hurt.  My initial thought was that since I practice yoga, I can heal myself.  I tried downward dog, plow pose, donurasana, spinal twists.  I tried hanging upside down and everything.   We've all heard stories about chiropractic.  It seems people either love them or hate them.  This was my first visit to a chiropractor, and I am a fan.         Although this guy, Danny is new to the Phoenix valley, he has been practicing in another state for a while.  He seems like he is from the mid west.  He is calm and and exudes a casual friendliness.     The office was slow or he was ready for me.  He led me to a table right away.  He took a minute to feel around as we talked about my pain.  He said it was obviously T7 based on what I was feeling in my back and it was quite common.  He said could skip the X-ray, if I wanted, since I mentioned I was price sensitive.    It didn't take long.  He adjusted me and then gave a brief massage around the area stretching the muscles around it.  He said it was important to adjust the muscles around the problem area because muscles are what holds the bones in place.  The massage was great.  Danny seems to have a massage background.  When I stood up, the pain was already gone.  As I write this review it has been 4 days and the pain has stayed away.  I did 30 miles on my bike today.  I am back to normal.  What surprises me most is that this Danny at Clarity solved my problem in probably less than 15 minutes and I don't need to go back.   I am used to doctors wanting to follow up perpetually for anther $50 visit etc....this guy seems to know he cured me and that was his intention.  He seemed to know I'd be a one time visit, he saved me the X-ray expense, anyway.  That makes it five stars in my book!  Ole!

"Forget about the fact that office is absolutely beautiful. Forget that the staff is so accommodating. Just forget that you're in a clinic all together... Now, I am not one to go to a Chiropractor! About 15 years ago I had a Chiropractor hurt me pretty bad, and since then, if I even heard someone say they were going to a chiropractor, I was the first to say ""Be Careful!""Well Dr. Luster saved my life yesterday! Seriously. I was in so much pain, I couldn't sleep, I couldn't bend over, I couldn't even drive properly. I was a mess. Ribs out of place, low back pain that wouldn't quit, and neck pain that prevented me from being able to fully rotate (How was I driving in the first place)Last night I finally got a decent nights sleep. And today I feel like a million bucks! Do you hurt Dr. Luster will make the hurt go away...I LOVE THIS PLACE! AND I GOT THE BEST ADJUSTMENT EVER!!!!!

"I love Dr. Luster and his staff.  They are friendly and professional.  Dr. Luster takes the time to address your back issues.  He takes his time to give you excellent care.  Thank you!

"This place is the greatest! My back gives me static from time to time so I go in and Dr. Luster is great about not just treating the problem, but also letting you know what to do to avoid those painsmuscle pullswhatever in the future. I'm not smart enough to follow his sensible advice, so I need to keep going back! Someday maybe I'll learn.

"This place is amazing from its atmosphere to its Staff!  Dr Luster truly cares about your health and he has the knowledge to help. Michelle is the best! She is like spending time with a best friend and makes you feel welcome your first time there! We love their flexibility and their willingness to make your life better.  You HAVE to give them a try!  You will not be disappointed!

"I have been getting adjusted  by Dr. Luster for about four years now and can honestly say he is the only chiropractor I let adjust me now.  The adjustments are smooth and the time and planning he puts into your care is unlike any other.  Most Chiropractors I grew up going to would adjust you in a minute or two and be off to the next patient.  Dr. Luster actually takes the time to figure out what's causing the problem and oddly enough will even take time to chat with you and make sure you feel comfortable.  He really is a great doctor I wish more Chiropractors were more like him.  Stop, wasting time searching around trust me you'll love him.  The front desk staff is friendly and will always greet you by name which i thought was a great plus as well!

"I love this Banana! There are always sales and promotions going on, so there are always bargains to be had. The store is always clean, and the staff is very friendly and knowledgeable about the product.I love that there are three floors to explore, two for women and one for men. The merchandising manager, Dean, has styled the store beautifully. I love looking at the styling on the mannequins to get ideas for outfits.The shoes have drastically improved over the years, and I absolutely love the Abby flats. They are extremely comfortable while still being stylish. They get new colors seasonally, which makes me a happy girl!

"As a former BR employee, I'm very hard on my shopping experiences at Banana Republic as a customer. However, I had a great time shopping here with my husband on Saturday! We shopped on all 3 floors and received multiple offers for assistance. My husband was the focus of the trip, and the guys on the men's floor were very helpful. They asked what we were shopping for, guided us in the right direction, and set up a fitting room for him while we were still browsing. Next time I needwant to shop at Banana, this will definitely be the store that I head to!

"I consider Dicks to be by far the best sporting good store in Charlotte or the surrounding areas. It has pretty much everything from basketball equipment to under armor clothing. They also carry things like exercise equipment, guns, heart monitors, weight lifting gear, etc, etc.They even have a climbing wall (at least the one at South Park mall does).

"I just ordered a knife from their online store.  It turns out their picture was wrong and I got the wrong blade.  I wrote them and Tiphany immediately sent me a prepaid FedEx label to return the knife and express mailed me a more expensive replacement at no cost.I'm very satisfied with my experience with them.

"Though Jessie Brown's isn't in the most accessible or likely location, it is easily one of my favorite places to buy gear and apparel. I've been coming here for the past couple of years and have always found items that were difficult to come by, deals that couldn't be resisted and always helpful staff. Though some of the gentlemen tend to have a bit of an attitude, they are always willing to help you find what you're looking for. The layout and decor is really welcoming and has a great feel. These guys have a great selection from different brands. North Face, Arcteryx, Patagonia, Marmot, and some others. I also really dig that they have a good selection of climbing shoes and gear. Their shoe selection is always packed with all different levels of outdoor need. I've never purchased one from these guys, but they have a killer selection of knives, too. In the past couple of years I've purchased plenty of MSR camp stove canisters from these guys. They always have a plethora. Also picked up a nice Thermarest from here. Most recently, my wife and I were looking for a nice mid-layer jacket for the winter for her. We checked out a few different options in the women's section and ended up scoring a great deal on a hooded zip from Patagonia. It was on crazy sale, too. Don't remember exactly how much we ended up paying, but I know it was close to 60% off from the previous year. If I'm ever looking for something particular, Jessie Brown's always has it or at least something comparable. Love coming to this local shop!

"Great shop. People are really nice, and they don't treat like a loser because you don't have a $1000 bike. We've bought three bikes from them and traded in two old ones - getting a good price for each. Awesome small shop - really recommend it.

"I have purchased several items from Mike and Gary over the years to include hockey gear, Oakley's, baseball gear, and now as of recent; Bikes. I used to be heavily involved in bike racing about 20 years ago, but becuase of the sport changing so much to this date, I once again went to the Village Peddler to ask the experienced and knowledgeable staff at VP. Having two boys changing from BMX style to Mountain bikes, I had no idea what to look for size wise. Gary showed both boys the different bikes and took the time to explain the differences. When each of them picked out the style of bike that they liked the most, Gary measured each of them and suggested the correct size knowing that they will need room to grow. In comparing two other bikes stores, their sale prices were still more than Village Peddler everday prices, can you say mark-up!Each of the boys were taught how to assemble and dissasemble their tires making sure to check the brakes to allow them for a seamless ride.Gary went over this a couple times to make sure the boys were comfortable to do it on there own, then asked them both to do it by themselves. After about two times, they are pros! I was impressed as I sat back and watched the interaction between the boys, Gary, and newly joining in on the conversation; Mike. It was impressive to see that both of the boys fealt comfortable and were totally ingaged with Gary and Mike like they had known them for years. It was obvious that both the men have kids and could relate specifically on a personal level before professional. Both Gary and Mike spent about 25 minutes with them, which in this day and age doesn't happen in the big corporate run stores. I have been in customer service myself for over 20 years, so it definitely takes a lot to impress me! I have visited other bike stores where we were just treated like a number, when finally asked if we needed help it was if the clerk was being timed to make sure he could get back to the next person in line. When I am considering spending a large amount of money, if I am not impressed with your customer service, you have definitely lost the sale. In this case, we as a family were treated excellent, and coming from a guy in his 40's, I don't find many places that are willing to make a good personal experience great, but in the case it most definitely was. We added several accessories to our purchase and all together spent far less than we would have elsewhere. Once we were done, both guys wheeled the bikes out and helped us secure them in the truck conveinently out a side door of their shop. While in the store, I picked out a couple of bikes that I am intersted in, and soon as have time, you can bet that I am going to head back and buy the one that makes the most sense. When I have a good experince shopping, I tend to tell everyone I know, and this time will be no different. Thanks for a pleasent experience guys, I really appreciate it! Charles

"Jayson, you're a douche nozzle.  When you talk about the ""white"" women in line waiting, you clearly not only have a issue with white people but women as well.  If you feel you were treated poorly, it most likely didn't happen and if it did you deserved it.  You expect too much in life and you give NOTHING in return.  You suck for coming on this page and talking trash about the best local sporting store around.  Go shop at a Big Box store where they don't care about you and you can claim all white people are racists all day long.  Dick head!

"Can't go wrong with their buy one, get one free t-shirt section! Always a lot to choose from and a great atmosphere in the heart of campus.

"TIS was definitely my favorite bookstore! It always had all my books, with used and new options. Reserving books online was definitely a time saver. It has a year round t-shirt deal, 3 for $20...hello Illinois t-shirt obsession, I now have over 20 Illinois t-shirts (I'm really serious). Sweatshirts are a little pricey here, but they tend to cost about the same at the other campus bookstores too.  During the book purchasing rush, the store has plenty of cashiers, so the wait is never too long. Writing this review is making me miss TIS and college....

"Ok I know what you're thinking, ""what is a person from Seattle doing reviewing a shop in Urbana"". Well here we go. My husband is from Champaign-Urbana and we are both Fightin' Illini fans (he by birth, me by marriage). We can't buy Illini gear in Seattle so we had to go in search of somewhere we COULD. Te'Shurt was the answer to our prayers! They have a website we can order our things from and they are always delivered in a timely manner for reasonable shipping. We have the Battle in Seattle coming up this weekend and we were in need of some fresh Orange hoodies to rep our team in style so to the Te'Shurt.com site we went. Ordered our hoodies and asked to have them delivered fast so we could get them in time for the game. Got a call the next day from Michelle and she was super friendly as she quoted the new price and told me I could think it over and email her back. I did and we are eagerly awaiting our sweatshirts that will be here in Seattle tomorrow, just in time for the BIG GAME on Saturday! Go Fightin' Illini and thank you Te'Shurt! We will be ordering again soon as all our kids want sweatshirts too!

"Awesome. They may be kind of small but they have made many great custom T-shirts for me even when I asked for them in a short amount of time. I haven't found anyone on the Internet yet that has made shirts at the same quality and speed as Te Shurt. It might be a bit more expensive than some places, but the quality of their lettering and presentation makes it worth the extra money.
",1
"The service I have received from Te Shurt has been great. I have done a couple group orders here and the woman I worked with was more than accommodating. I've requested orders on such a short time span and she worked with me to make sure everything I wanted was produced. The quality of the custom printed shirts are superior to other printers on campus. You won't feel like you have a shield of armor on your chest if you have a big design that uses a lot of ink. Some of the girls who work at the registers are idiots but what can you expect from a simple t-shirt shop. If you are ordering shirts and you are polite, reasonable, and know what you want you shouldn't have a problem. That's life for ya.

"I bought the best pair of pants  New York and Company, but they were made for a Mammoth Supermodel (the were sold of the ones for ""normal"" women). Anywho, I took these pants in to Brother's because my husband said they were good and THEY ARE AMAZING!!! The pants were done in 15 MINUTES and when I looked at the hem, it was the BEST I'VE EVER SEEN!!! THIS PLACE IS WORTH THE MONEY!$!
",1
"I needed 2 pairs of pants altered in a hurry so I looked on Yelp for a solid place by my house.  I couldn't be happier with this place.  The service, price and quality I received were excellent.  My pants were ready at the date and time promised and there were no issues.  I am glad to have found a great tailor close by and will definitely be back.

"I went in to Brothers to buy a suit and I always have trouble buying a suit because I have huge shoulders and a tiny waist in comparison to my shoulders. Every suit I buy has to be completely recut and altered, the problem is no one ever makes the final product look good. I haven't had a tailor do all my alterations and have everything look exceptional at the end. The owner worked with me personally and after trying 8-10 different design & models we finally found one that fit like a glove with minimal alterations required. I was so thrilled with how everything fit that I decided to order custom shirts because I have a problem getting measured for those as well. I have a big neck, big shoulders and a small waist so finding shirts that fit well is nearly impossible. After the shirts came in and tryed them on, I have litteraly never had shirts that fit so perfect, and the compliments I got made it worth while. I highly recommend and you should see for yourself.

"I went into Brothers tailoring to buy suits. I was absolutely blown away! Gus and his family were spectacular! I wear suits to work every day and will not ever buy from anyone else. They helped me pick out suits handled the tailoring, and were so fun and entertaining as well. Do not think twice and do not go anywhere else!!
",1
"In a last ditch attempt at exhibiting what may be the last shred of virility within my being, I took one of my vintage Robert Graham shirts to Brothers.I did so after my wife plucked it from the Goodwill pile, reasoning how these folks can fix anything, and how I shouldn't give away such an expensive party shirt. I agreed.And now I have a vintage Robert Graham shirt hanging in my closet. Just hanging there.Waiting...for the day when my wife says something like;        ""Hey, wanna go clubbing tonight""I have a feeling it may have to go back to Brothers a few more times in its hanging career...while my weight changes... like I'm a finalist in the Duncan Yo-Yo tournament.

"I had three suits made not too long ago that all fit well and were comfortable. I went in today to get them touched up at Brother's. After trying them all on, the guys there said they were well tailored suits and not to waste my money. I was amazed that instead of trying to make a buck off of my misjudgment and therefore an unnecessary service, they were completely honest. I mean, they technically lost business today because they didn't push for me to get them tailored. Instead, they have gained my business for as long as I am in AZ because of their direct honesty and good principles. I will, and do, recommend this place for anyone who wants an honest opinion on suits. While I haven't had one madetailored there yet, their business principles alone will bring me back

"I guarantee you will have a pleasurable experience at Brother's Tailors. Not only is the owner, Gus, a pleasant guy to do business with; he will have you laughing at his general demeanor every visit. On my second visit he recognized my face and instantly made me feel welcome. Not only is Gus very hospitable, the rest of the staff follows suit (horrible pun intended). You know the other tailors you go to that know you by ticket number STOP GOING THERE! Brothers will make you feel like you're their only customer and will have you walking away feeling like a million bucks every time. I'll admit, I went into the store based on a friend's suggestion and when I first walked in, judging by the size of the place, I thought my friend had played a joke on me. Do not be fooled by its appearance. Brother's is the real deal. In terms of selection they have everyone covered. You can walk in and get a $150 suit off the rack, which they'll tailor to your specifications at an insanely low price. Or you can walk in and completely customize a bespoke power suit. If you don't really know what you want or you're buying your first suit, for example, Gus or the other staff members will work with you for as long as it takes to get it right. When I went in for a custom suit, Gus took no less than two hours catering to my every request. Is that something you'll get at Men's Warehouse The answer is no. To be honest, I will never step foot in another tailor's shop. There's a reason why this establishment has a 5 star rating.  I've been 4 times and Gus and his staff have already made me feel like family. This is the way small business is done.       Yes, Gus calls every guy that walks in the store a model. Yes, when you come in for one suit he'll ask whether you want 6 or 7. However, the bottom line is that Brothers will give you the best customer service, they'll make sure you get exactly what you want, and they'll do it all for the best price in town.

"Gus is absolutely the man. The other guy working there, who I believe is his son, is also very good at what he does, as is Gus' wife.I went in to get a custom suit, and could tell that Gus took a ton of pride in his work. He had very strong opinions on what my suit should look like because he wanted to make sure that anyone who saw the suit would be impressed by it. We ended up picking out a great material, and a few weeks later the suit was ready.I'd always heard the expression ""fits like a glove"", but I never really understood it until I tried that suit on. I *thought* I had worn suits that fit me in the past, but now I know I was sorely mistaken. This guy is going to be making all of my suits as long as I'm in the valley.
",1
"We have been frequenting Brother's Tailoring since they first opened. They were awesome then and they still are today. Over the years we have had hundreds of garments fixed, shortened, altered, etc, all done perfectly and promptly. As of late I have bought a few suits and several pants for work. Gus, Margarita and their son have taken great care of myself and my family. I love Mom & Pop shops and this place embodies what a full service tailer should be.

"I Highly recommend Peter ""the  1 Son"" he makes buying a suit or just boring alterations fun.  This was my 1st time here    All of the customers love him and his family!  Thank you for all of your help I will definitely come back.

"Submitted measurements online from New Jersey about a month ahead of our Vegas wedding. Week or so later received an email saying my tux was ready and I should stop in to try it on when I arrive in Vegas. Was not going to since I had arranged for delivery and pickup to and from my hotel. But I am so glad I stopped in a few days beforehand.The shirt was a little big as well as the jacket (was our fault, we did our own measurements). They fixed that right up in the shop, and the tux that was delivered to the hotel was perfect. A classy tuxedo at a decent price.Just super nice people. I am so thankful they took care of me.
",1
"I haven't needed a tux in several years (since high school), but this was one special New Year! I popped into Tuxedo Junction, and was quickly measured for my Tux. I got all black everything. The staff is really friendly, and professional (whatever that means). They even know quite a bit about house music. EDM is taking over Vegas!They know how to properly measure you, but most importantly, they know their clothes!Two days after my fitting, I came in to pick up my Tux. Word to the wise...try it on before leaving. I apparently lost some weight in the two days I waited, and had to get a slightly different size. No big deal. They took care of it on the spot.I'd come back for another tux! Most likely, next year for New Year's!Thank you Tuxedo Junction!

"I have lived down the street from this place for ELEVEN YEARS, but never went in until yesterday. I needed a tuxedo for a weird sort of lesbo-chic photo shoot, where I would be wearing a purple 80s bridesmaid dress and another female model would be wearing a tux. The other model was too busy to go to the tux place, so the photographer asked me to do it.A SUPER-friendly, helpful kid named Zach helped me try on all kindsa creepy mini-tuxedos that must have been designed for teenage boys or something, because they fit me perfectly. Then he helped me find the right shade of purple for the bowtiecummerbund....and this was going off a shitty cell phone pic I had of the dress.The photo shoot isn't until the end of the month, but I'll be sure to post a pic here... so you can see Zach's fabuous work. The rental is going to be $100 for the day...not bad at all!This shop was clean, well-lit, and VERY well staffed! Check it out!

"This place!!  I walked out of Men's Wearhouse very angry after being told my son's vest rental would cost $75!!  Yes one vest for one night!!  I called to check prices and felt like I had returned from the twilight zone.  I drove directly over, got my son fitted for a vest and even rented shoes for a total of $25.  After realizing I may have been a little angry still when I arrived I told the clerk where I came from and it was obvious he immediately understood my frustration.  Love giving business to local businesses to help out my town and without a doubt have my business for life!

"Went in to rent a tux for prom and although it looks a little run down, the service is actually really really great, the whole staff was friendly! I was helped by a pretty woman called Nicole and she was on top of everything, and the total was under $80 which blew me away. Great great place.
",1
"While growing up, my family owned a formal and men's wear store, so I understand a little about the business and some of the challenges.  Working with them upon different occasions, I am always impressed by their professionalism and dedication to making things right.  When I referred a friend for his wedding, I had pre-selected a style which I thought would be perfect.  Upon arrival, and pulling the full tuxes for them to try on, we realized it wasn't the right look for the guys.  Nicole was outstanding in helping us switch out to try a couple other looks and making sure everyone was comfortable.  Having worked with Nicole before, I can attest her patience and demeanor is perfect!What I like most is that they have just about everything in stock.  They can make alterations there as well, so if the groomsmen arrive with the wrong measurements (which is not so out of the ordinary), they can measure to make sure they have the right fit.  Michelle is my main contact and is always ready to provide guidance and support.  I have yet to find anyone in the group that is not exceptional!They are definitely customer service oriented and are always there to help walk you through the process.

"This place is so great. The service is amazing and everyone is so friendly! I can't believe how many more options there are! Many more options here than mens wear house. I was so disappointed at their service and options. We can't wait to use tuxedo junction for our wedding day

"Being a guy, waited until the last possible minute (no, literally) to get a tux for my wedding (my wife was horrified).  Linda (hope I got the name right - short firecracker) had me in and out in under 30 minutes with the exact tux I was looking for.  Need a tux  Go here.

"This little boutique may be small but it packs a big punch in the world of shoes and I could spend all day drooling over the babies in here. It did make me sad to see my very own peep-toe Louboutins displayed in the window here all shiny and new when mine are a bit more well loved and not in the same condition as the beautiful new ones in the window. Oh well, I guess shoes are for wearing and I've certainly got the wear out of mine.In addition to Louboutins Pam Jenkins also offers, Jimmy Choo's, Tory Burch and Kate Spade so if you're a shoe fan head along here to check out the glamorous heels.They also do sales so you could grab yourself a bargain pair of beautiful shoes. Hurrah!

"Man, oh man. You've got game if you shop here. If I were a guy, I would buy my entire wardrobe from Stitched. A combination of classic and contemporary, suiting and street - this is how a man with swag dresses!The store itself is the ultimate man cave. There's a billiard table in the back, flat screen tvs on ESPN and even a whisky lounge with Macallan scotch lockers to rent. There are also several cool choppers worked into the decor. There's an on-site tailor stitching up sharp suits too, personalized with your name if you'd like. Probably the only thing missing is a cigar bar and hot female cocktail servers.Price points are really reasonable. A lot of the coats and blazers that I liked were around $250. You'll find ready to wear brands like George Esquivel, Jacks & Jokers, Rag & Bone, Cr8tive Recreation, Louis Stewart and Psycho Bunny.And girls, the sharp looking men that work here make the visit worthwhile too.

The ambiance of the store is done perfectly and would be respected by anyone interested in interior design. It is obvious the people who work at Stitched are deeply knowledgeable and passionate regarding fashion and truly love what they do. *I mentioned that I was going to be eating at STK that night and he suggested he walk us up (my group of 7 had no reservations on a busy night).

"I love love love Stitched.This little men's clothing boutique in the Cosmo hotel is very unassuming, especially when compared to the nightclub-like AllSaints next door.  It's also very elegant, with decor reminiscent of an upscale bachelor pad, complete with leather couches and liquor cabinet.The clothing selection is excellent.  Their in-house brand offers up wonderfully tailored shirts and suits.  I adore the accessories, especially the collection of colorful silk ties that seems to go on forever.  And the hats  To die for.I wasn't planning on buying clothing in Vegas, but I fell in love with the selection of Hudson jeans and couldn't say no to them.  And the prices at Stiched are actually reasonable compared to some of the other overheated Strip shops.  The real highlight is the staff.  Ryan B. was infinitely helpful and patient with me while I tried on various items and acted like my typical, obnoxiously indecisive self.I'd be back to give Stitched my business anytime.  :-)

"Hooray for the Vikings.  Sure they might have looted and pillaged their way across Europe and spawned plenty of bad death metal bands, but in the grand scheme of things that's pretty minor. Why Because without a little genetic mutation spawned in Scandinavia that allows adults to continue consuming dairy all their lives, I'd have to avoid the amazing cheese section that Penn Mac has and would be stuck eating some funky soy based cheese or *gasp* having to do without and that would be a sad day indeed.With enough cheeses to make Wallace & Gromit happy, you are bound to find what you are looking at Penn Mac.   And if you don't know what you are looking for the cheesemongers are great in helping you find your whey.If that was all Penn Mac had it would still be a required shopping destination, but they have so much more.

"I agree, this is a wonderful place to buy cheese.  Anywhere else in Pittsburgh (and I do mean TJ's and Whole Foods, as well as Giant Eagle) your cheese is likely to taste like the plastic it is wrapped in.  At Penn Mac, it's not only the best in town, it's beyond excellent.  In price, freshness, quality, selection.  You can buy half pounds, despite what the sign says.  I always did.  I also think the nuts are a great deal,  and the spices.  Worth the trek from whatever neighborhood you live in, or from your downtown workplace.  If you have a car, they do have (limited) parking in back.  And some of the nicest flowers in Pittsburgh are sold out front, too!  Holiday seasons and weekends this place is a bit nuts, but I went regularly, year-round, maybe every 2 weeks and totally relied on this place.Foodies visiting Pittsburgh, especially if you're staying in the Convention Center area, should definitely check out ""the Strip"" for shopping and snacks.

"Penn Mac deserves more than 5 stars!This place is the best italian food store I've seen anywhere in the US.  The selection and quality of their cheeses, meats, olives, pastas, oils, sauces, etc is just incredible.  The prices are also really good - any other store with a big cheese selection will charge a ton more.I used to shop here at least once a week and since I've moved away from Pittsburgh, this is the store I miss the most.  I now live in Chicago and even here there is nothing like it.  I still frequently buy their stuff online through their website....Thank God for the internet.Favorite items include: Calabrese Olives, House Italian Olive Oil, Istara Cheese, Mortadella wPistaccio, Ciabatta Bread
",1
"So much to oggle, so much to buy! I think I'm in love. I had too much fun at this place! Great selections of cheese, meat, pasta, etc... makes me want to buy and play. They also had the biggest bottles of olive oil I'd ever seen... so, you know, you can buy just that exact quantity of oil that you need. I must go back.
",1
"dudes and dudettes, this place is amazing. they've got cheese, pepperoni and prosciutto coming out their ears. fresh pasta, homemade pasta sauce and olive oil from the barrel for the taking. they've got frozen dough, pepperoni slices and shredded cheese all next together if you want to bake your own pizzas. when they're not busy go to the deli and find the perfect compliment to whatever wine you've been needing an excuse to drink. the people that work there are the nicest folk that clearly love their jobs. most of them love that i don't know the first thing about anything italian because it gives them a chance to share what it is they specialize in. goods are cheap, fresh and of the highest quality. i hope i'm able to find something similar when i move soon. one of the top 10 reasons i've enjoyed my time in pittsburgh.

"""Hey, darling, you talkin' to your boyfriend""  the deli counter man recently teased me as I waited in line talking on my cell phone.  Oh the deli men - they're hilarious.  I'd even say, their worth the trip out to the store, but you might want to know more about the food, glorious food. I shop at the Macaroni Company weekly.  They're great.  From the deli men who hand you samples of meats and cheeses while you wait, to the great selection of bulk foods, to fine selection of meats to the Italian cheeses, to the fill-a-bottle- olive oil station to the fresh pasta to the bulk spices section to the moon and the sun and the earth and Jupiter, this place is lovely.  (Or loverly if your Eliza Dolittle).  The place tends to be packed like a tin of touch-a-philic sardines on the weekends, and I think many people are tourists, but that doesn't stop it from being great. And, that was a long sentence, but not as long as those of some really antiquated authors I've read.In any case, the Macaroni Company is a little slice of Italy mixed with Pittsburgherness and fun.
",1
"I will never buy any type of Italian sausage at Giant Eagle again because now i know what real sausage tastes like.  And, the deli counter guy at Giant Eagle doesn't inappropriately and amusingly call me ""babe"" every five seconds like the ones at Penn Mac do.   Ordering ""hot italian sausage"" from a deli guy that calls you ""babe"" is as amusing as Sunday morning can get.   :-)    I'll keep coming here for fresh meats and cheeses as long as I live in Pittsburgh.

"I walked into Penn Macaroni Co knowing I knew absolutely nothing about cured meats and cheeses.  I've always been intimidated by specialty shops bc there are always giant lines with people who look impatient and want to just grab what they need and head out.  I decided to swallow up my fear and head inside with the intention of walking out knowing more than when I walked in.I headed to the cured meats section in the deli room and kinda just stood back staring at all the beautiful meats.  When one of the deli guys was free and asked me if I needed help, I flat out told him ""I know nothing about anything in this room.  But I want to learn.""  And he was like ""I got just what you need"" and brought out some samples for me.  He went on to explain them to me and what kind of cheeses to pair with stuff.  After I picked out my meat, I was heading over to the cheese counter when he kinda called me out and was like ""I'm not done with you yet!"" and handed me butcher paper with even more cured meats and cheeses to try out.  He also told me I have to feed my friend more bc she looked too skinny, =P.I love going into a store where I get individualized attention by someone who actually cares about what he or she is doing and is passionate about his or her job.  It just makes you walk out with a smile on your face.I plan on heading back every other week to get a new pairing of meats and cheeses and hopefully one day my palate will be super sophisticated, haha

"My boyfriend and I made a trip to Wisconsin Dells for my birthday and stopped here on the way back to Chicago to get some cheese. All of the employees here were extremely helpful and friendly. Cheese was decent priced and delicious. I'd recommend it.
",1
"Great little shop off of the interstate. I was looking for a place to go that wasn't fast food and wasn't the same old-same old. I was surprised how much I liked this place. Made to order deli-sandwiches, cheese, fudge, a New Glarus beverage and Southern Comfort Yes, Southern Comfort. True one stop shopping. I will make this a regular stop between Elgin and Minnesota!
",1
"Sample the many varieties of cheese and take some Butter Swiss home, you will love the flavor!! :)
",1
"We always seem to miss these cheese shops passing through the Dells. We stopped here coming back from Des Plaines in Oct., and it's right off the exit. As you enter there is a display of fudge, but they only want to cut it for you on the way out. Next are all the gadgets and gifts. I got some cool reading glasses, a ghost cheese spreader, body shampoo, a WI shot glass, cheese slicer. We were hosting the upcoming fountain pen meeting and bought a great variety of meats and cheeses. One large beef summer sausage I brought to my thanksgiving hostess. Picked up a cranberry jelly, various crackers. I got to sample all the cheese spreads, and settled on the sharp cheddar. I loved the beef and cheese snack pack because they came in small bites. We left with a few sundries, and of course the fudge. Be prepared to drop at least $100. And this was us restraining ourselves.
",1
"Free samples of cheese, cheese spreads, and fudge! As good as it gets! I love this place. We bought about $15 worth of cheese after being pampered and trying about 10 different types of cheese, 5 types of cheese spreads, and 2 types of fudge. The store has tons of Wisconsin favorites, which I suppose is in part of attracting tourists to think that they are purchasing purely ""Wisconsin"" delicacies!
",1
"Cheese, cheese and more cheese! Oh and wine, fudge and kitschy souvenirs, too. The anticipation of stopping here on the way back to Chicago from Hanock, WI made the three hour ride home more bearable. The staff was super friendly and willing to let you sample almost anything. I tried some cheese spreads, fudge and fancy cheeses such as Mango Habanero. I regret not picking up more cheese!
",1
"SO happy we stopped here. Wisconsin cheese, wine & beer...perfect for dinner!!! We tried about 10 cheeses and fudge. ..they were all so good.The dark chocolate caramel salted fudge was delicious. Glad we stopped here and so will you. :)
",1
"Right off the freeway, next to a gas station. We couldn't visit Wisconsin without a trip We had low expectations since it looked cheesy (yes I said it) from the outside and we expected this place to be a regular liquor store. But it is truly a wonderful world of cheese, fudge,  great wine end beer selections. they have a table where you can sample any of their many cheese spreads. Here are some of the flavors: taco, smoked, port wine, bacon, pumpkin, cranberry, garlic, etc. So many choices, so little money unfortunately. Then there was the selection of blocks of every kind of cheese. The staff was very knowledgable and helpful. You can sample pretty much everything besides the alcohol, of course. I love this place and would come back someday, if I want to make the 9 hr drive again. But I got a brochure so I can order online too.
",1
"I like that this place has a big selection of craft beers. They have a mix and match section which is $9.99 for a 6 pack. That is pretty standard pricing. The guy was very knowledgeable and gave me recommendations as to what I would like. They have a huge cheeses, wine, fudge and specialty food items. You could sample whichever cheese you wanted, many of them unique. We know Wisconsin is full of cheese and boy did this place deliver. At check-out they had fudge pops which were also pretty tempting.
",1
"I love cheese! This place is like, I imagine, many others throughout Wisconsin. But since I went to this one and liked it, 5 stars.We stopped here on a road trip and was happy to see it open before 10. Walking in we saw more than just a cheese house. They had specialty gifts, wine, beer and fudge amongst a haven of cheese. The people who worked here were incredibly helpful and friendly. They were happy to give advice about what beer we would like and happily cut samples of cheese. Although we only left with a 6 pack of Wisconsin only beer for $9.99, I was tempted to buy much much more. It is possible we will stop on our way back!
",1
"The first time I stepped into the store, I was hit by a wave of wonderful aromas that reminded me of growing up in Germany. The lunch meats, smoked hams, brats, blutwurst, etc are from authentic German recipes, and one can even get a real schnitzel here. The ladies behind the counter treat you like you would get treated in a store in Germany, and the store also offers a selection of foods imported from Germany. Jams, coffee, breads, dairy products like butter and quark, cookies, candy, canned goods, cooking and baking mixes.... If you have German recipes and haven't made them because you can't find the right ingredients, or if you just like good food, please pay this store a visit. You will be pleasantly surprised. But bring cash! No credit cards accepted. Or you could go next door to the Black Forest Mill to have your German meal prepared for you along with a German beer....
",1
"This place is a wonder.  All kinds of sausages, and meats.  I'm a real push over for smoked meat.  I especially like their lachs schinken which is smoked ham cut very thin.  Making soup  Try it with a smoked pork haxen.  Another favorite is their fleisch salat.  But beware, the fleisch salat is put into a container without weighing so the price of each container may not be what you think it will be.....close but not exact.Great place and like all German butcher shops, it's closed on Monday.
",1
"Mmmmmmmmmmmmm.I can smell those brats simmering in beer & onions....ahhhhhhhSimply the best.
",1
"The German Sausage company is the closest thing we have to a big city charcuterie in Phoenix.  Our family has been enjoying their homemade ham, lyoner, bratwurst and smoked meats for 30 years.  Their prices are so much more reasonable than the grocery store deli counters and their products are always very fresh.  Walking through the door will immediately transport you to Europe!  Don't miss this Valley gem  - cash or check only just like the olden days!
",1
"So glad we found this place! Everything is fresh and tastes just like we get when we are in Germany! Walked out with some fresh warm pretzels last week too!  This is our number one place for authentic German meat.
",1
"Best German sausages that I ever had.  They taste the same as those that I had when I traveled to Germany.  And the best thing is that they will vacuum packed them so they can last for a month and taste just as fresh as long as you don't break the package.
",1
"I was raised in Germany... This place is as close to ""home"" as it gets! Try everything. The service is gracious.... Bring CASH!!! If the made cake that day, don't ask what it is, just buy it, it's going to be delicious!!!! Leberwurst (liver wurst) is fantastic, best I have had in the us! Every sausage tastes authentic and fresh! You won't regret it...
",1
"This place is awesome. We can't eat regular store bought brats anymore. Their potato salad is to die for as well.When you walk in you get a strong smell of....well something awesome and smokey and realize behind the register there are smoked something or others hanging right there in front of you. To the left are some grocery items as well as spietzle (sp) and some other items. To the right is the deli counter that holds TONS of meats and other goodies as well as their brats. They have two kinds, from what I have seen, course ground and find ground I believe. I am not sure of the difference since we usually only get the fine ground white ones.They make limited portions of everything since its all fresh, so get there fast for the potato salad.This is our go to for grilling out and its always delicious.
",1
"This is a true phoenix treasure! The two sisters are very helpful, pleasant and business-like. Sometimes when they have meat just out of the smoker, they will offer a sample, or they'll toss in an end chub (wrapped) into your bag...it seems like they know you're going to rip into one of the other packages, if they don't! Come with cash & chose practically anything...sandwich meat, sausages or the uber yummy beer-case cheese!  Every time in, there are usually some Europeans shopping there which also validates the legitimacy of this fine establishment!
",1
"Nothing I love more than German sausage! And when it's authentic, I can't stop smiling - just standing in the store hearing orders in Deutsch sends me over the moon!! Today I just grabbed 2 wieners and 2 bratwurst as I patiently await my sauerkraut I've got brewing in my crock at home. Homemade cheese and cabbage soup with authentic fried wiener on top and I've got myself heaven. Have always wanted to stop in here and now I have a reason to make it a constant in my life!!
",1
"This place is truly a gem of the east valley. First of all, it's cheaper than cheap. Secondly, and most importantly, they have the most amazing selection of LOCALLY grown produce! Oh my god, it makes me so happy I'm probably going to cry. I asked the owners how they keep their prices so reasonable and they said it's because they work with farmers that don't sell at the local farmer's markets, but want to sell their produce nonetheless. What they can't get locally (due to season or unavailability) they have from other states. They also carry home-made tortillas, kettle corn, honey, and salsas- all local! I absolutely love this place. If you can't get to the Farmer's Markets or live too far (like me) you have to check this place out!
",1
"Over the summer months, this stand-alone farmer's market doesn't carry as much locally grown produce, especially at the end of the summer like July-Sept. Nearly everything they carry is from elsewhere due to the high heat of AZ I'm sure. That's fine with me but unfortunately that means veggies and fruit from other parts of the country that aren't as fresh. I've gotten some bad produce but the good part is I can just take it back and get a refund. I do think though that next summer during this time I'll be going to one of the various weekly farmer's markets or just to Sprouts for produce. Every other time I'll still be here. :)
",1
"One of the great things about living near farmland is... farmer's markets! Of course it's a little tricky to do here in the heat of the summer, but the Power Road market manages to stay stocked year around with produce that is fresh and for the most part local. It's a small Mom-n-Pop market, but they work with local retailers around the valley to bring in all sorts of different foods that go way beyond produce. They also roast fresh chilies daily, & sell locally made tamales and salsa too. The prices are what really get me. So many complain about the jacked-up prices of farmer's markets, but this place has always been either the same in price, or I pay even less. Plus, because most of it is local, the food lasts longer! If you're in the east valley, they are worth checking out and changing where you buy your produce. Buy local whenever you can!
",1
"This little farmers market is pretty solid. Fresh, local produce that beats the hell out of anything you can get at the grocery store. The tomatoes they sell actually taste like tomatoes! Their fruit is much better as well and the the kicker...wait for it....Freshly roasted Hatch green chilies! They also have a peach orchard out back. You can pick your own or buy them in the shop when they're in season. Just a great, all around local farmer's market. You need to check it out.
",1
"Great produce and cheap prices-not to mention friendly staff-could not ask for more!
",1
"I love this market.  The prices are a bit steep, and if your order is less than 10 bucks they charge you to use a credit card, but other than that, a great place to do business with.  The DO carry fresh okra, but you will want to call to be sure they have it in stock because it sells fast (480-497-0706) - Julie will usually hold some for you if you are on your way and will be there in just a short while.  TJ - nah, he has to be prodded.  They also carry green tomatoes - but call first.  Lastly, they carry fresh Hatch green chili (in season - Aug - Oct) in Big Jim, Barkers, and Sandia.  This is a family business I was happy to find and will continue to support for a long time.
",1
"I have lived not 5 miles from the fabulous market and just never noticed it or went in till yesterday. What a FIND! Fresh farm eggs, Local artisanal cheeses. I bought a black truffle parmesan chunk and it is so rich and delicious. I also bought some "" Holy Hummus "", OMG it is so luscious and fresh. This is family run and the woman who checked me out could not have been nicer. The produce was spectacular. This is a gem in my own neighborhood that I just discovered!

"Brennan's is a top notch market.  They offer a wide variety of fresh fruit and vegetables all year long, bread from local bakers, a full meat counter, and a large outdoor gardening area in the summer.  There's an extensive wine and liquor store in back, with a knowledgeable staff to help you navigate.  To top it all off, they carry an insane variety of cheese, much of which you can sample - get your squeaky fresh cheese curds here if you missed them at the Farmer's Market.
",1
"I made my first trip to Brennan's today and it was well worth the trip across town. The fruit and veggies were absolutely beautiful and delicious. They have signs indicating where the produce came from and little pre-cut samples so you can taste how good everything is. The Michigan blueberries they have in right now are heavenly. The fresh bakery area smelled wonderful. The meat counter is run by Jacobson's brother and had a deli case of typical salads and deli meats as well as fresh steaks, pork, and chicken. I grilled up a small sirloin that tasted like summer. There is also a fresh fish counter, a lot of wine, and a ton of cheese many of which you can sample.
",1
"I love Brennan's!  They have a great beer and cheese selection. The fruit is always fresh and usually the best in the area.  My one compliant is that they are more expensive than other places, but it is worth the extra cost for great products and service.
",1
"I finally set foot in a Brennan's market, and I am so glad I did!  For produce, the place is unbeatable.  The fruit looked perfectly ripe and yummy, and they had all these samples.  Plus, they had a ton of different cheeses.You know what I honestly think is the best thing ever  The Brennan's granola.  But at $10 a bag, it's a little pricey.  Kind of worth it sometimes though.
",1
"I stopped by Brennan's every day on my recent trip to Madison.The produce is so good, especially the Idaho peaches. The local cherry wine, cheese curds and organic honey pretzel sticks were also awesome. I could gain 50 pounds on the free samples alone.I miss you, Brennan's!
",1
"Copious samples garnish the aisles. Local flavor is found at every turn. Then, there's the annual selection of selection of World Championship cheeses. Brennan's is the single most place that I recommend all who visit Madison to visit. Plenty of people drive along the many cheese barns of the interstate, only to find a selection of novelty items and subpar cheeses. So, if you're not from the area and you find yourself in town, this is your chance to learn what cheese in Wisconsin is all about. The smoked mozzarella sticks find me every time.
",1
"Awesome!  Brennan's has the best selection of Wisconsin cheeses - many are award winning - and they taste wonderful.  Plenty of samples!  Their fruit selection is unmatched in Dane County.  Again, more samples!  It's nice to buy great tasting fruit that isn't spoiled one day later.  We always take out-of-town friends and family to Brennan's at least once during their visits.
",1
"I love Brennan's! You can always find great local food and produce here. They put out lots of fun samples and the staff is always smiling and helpful.
",1
"I only go to this place for my steaks, this is the closest place you'll find to prime. Their grade is high quality choice grade, not like the ones you see at the grocery store, but better!
",1
"I go here to buy cheese, fresh fruit, and frozen fruit. The cheese selection is excellent. Much of it is packaged under their own label. They obtain many of the national cheese contest winners. Most of it is affordable high quality cheese. They often have samples. They'll help you out if you are buying for a party or a gift. They sell holiday gift boxes and make spreads, etc. for parties. The fresh fruit selection is excellent. They often have samples-very important to me with peaches and plums-I find the best ones they have and then buy a box.  They have bags of frozen fruits (and vegetables). A good place to get fruit for pie or smoothies when fresh is not available. They seem to have a lot of beer and wine, a meat shop, vegetables, and bread as well but look to the other reviews for info on that. They also have some packaged goods that seem a little on the expensive side. I just stick with the cheese and fruit.

"""If you want a good, tasty, budget brat,"" says my bossman, ""go for the johnsonville smoked cheddar jalepeno"".  *cringe*Two things here:  (1) what the heck is a ""budget brat"" and (2) BARF!  If you're going to eat meat in tube form.  Do yourself a favor:  spend the extra 20 cents per pound (yes I actually checked some brat prices), go down to Bavaria Sausage Kitchen, and get the real thing.  They've got your regular brats, your fresh brats, your smoked brats, your beer brats, your weiners, your weisswurst, your polish and a bunch of sausages you've probably never heard of, but are undoubtedly delicious.  I did a BBQ for about 70 people, which gave me the opportunity to load up on just about every tubed meat in the case.  Plus BSK has their more popular products packed in cases of 25, in the freezer, ready to go.  Service was nice and prompt, even with such a big order right near the end of business.  And, most importantly, my customers were happy.  I received lots of compliments on the quality, and there wasn't a single sausage left at the end of the day (although I did spy a few half-eaten greasy frozen burgers that had been abandoned).  So for the quality, the location, and the service....Bavaria Sausage Kitchen has earned their five stars.  A few minor details.  Thanks to Daniel K. for the recommendation.  The BSK website looks a little garish, but his comment got me over that.  Also, let me say, BSK has TONS of other products.  We talking cold cuts, salami, bacon, cured pork concoctions, cheeses, dry goods, and what appears to be the largest collection of imported Haribo (German original brand of gummi candy) anywhere outside of Germany.  I won't lie, I took a couple packs to snack on.
",1
"Jawohl! This place is the bee's knees, the brat's tots, er...it's zehr gut. Mr. G fired up a tasty smoked brat that we later added to red beans and rice. Dang. That is no budget brat! The ladies behind the counter were very helpful and, because we bought a huge amount for a party, they even threw in a free box of orange liqueur chocolates for us!I inquired about a curious sign near the cash register that read ""Fresh Venison"". Basically, if you're a local hunter and bring your deer in here, they'll do all the necessary butchering for you. Sometimes they have leftovers for customers to purchase. Sounds a little wild, but next time I might be game!Oh, and ditto on the Haribo gummy candy selection. It's huge.
",1
"I've never had a bad experience at this place.  The German food selection is great and the frozen and refrigerated selection is always tasty (I recommend the sauerbraten). Fridays when the weather is nice they grill out on the front lawn.  Stop by for a great selection of sausages cooked up fresh.As a counter point to a one star review for this place...  It was written while Bavaria Sausage was closed for fire repairs, so who knows how accurate that review might be.
",1
"HOW HAS NO ONE REVIEWED THIS PLACE YET!It's amazing! We need more places like this in America!My boyfriends parents wanted a gift card from here for Christmas, so we made a stop while we were in town yesterday.As mentioned previously, IT'S AMAZING.I'm a vegetarian, so the meat has no appeal to me, but they had a ton of sausages, sliced meats, and even fish! Their selection of cheese was also quite impressive. What really was cool to me was the massive amounts of chocolate and European bakery mixes! I had a hard time picking out what I wanted, until I saw a box full of chocolate with a picture of kittens on it, and it was called Katzenzungen! Its so fun just to say! Although, I looked it up on the internet and the chocolates are supposed to look like cat tongues...which is kinda weird but still super awesome at the same time!I will for sure stop in and visit Bavaria the next time I am in Madison!

"A Great German Deli and Sausage HouseThis little store has everything you would ever need that is German, and Sausages galore!  They make their own german style sausages in house and they are some of the best sausages you will ever have.  The store is wooden, and looks quaint, and the selection is varied.  Inside they have a German style deli with cold cuts and fresh sausage, and in the corner, they have a freezer where you can buy boxes and boxes of sausages.  From Brats, to White Sausage, to Weiners, there is nothing they don't have.  German Candy is found in the corner, and dried meats on the other side of the store... pickles are on the wall and ginger bread treats in the aisle.  Service is good, and the staff is so friendly.
",1
"I like this store for its products and its knowledgeable staff.  I guess if I need smiles I'll go to a strip club, as long as you keep giving them money they'll keep smiling.

"I lived in Madison for a couple years. Now that I have moved away, there are a couple things that I sincerely miss. Sausages from Bavaria Sausage Inc are some of those things. This place is amazing. It is outside the main part of the city, but it isn't too far away. Do yourself a favor and purchase some delicious tubular meats from these guys. The cheese is pretty tasty as well.

"These are your go to-  goat cheese people . Not only do they make good cheese but they are an awesome long time local dairy family that I have adored for over 10 years! ..Love to buy local You should  than hit up one of their stands at one of the Local Farmers Markets. Try the bucky breeze , it's like a sour cream creme fraiche   I love  the feta it's super yummy with eggs !!
",1
"Really everyone Just 4 stars Crow's Dairy get's 5. They have the best chevre I've ever tasted. Consistently excellent smooth texture. The flavor has the nice tanginess of goat cheese but it's very smooth and clean. Some goat cheeses can get a little too overwhelming. I've been buying them at a various local farmer's markets for a while. Since I'm slow on the uptake I didn't realize it was available on the shelves of the Phoenix Public Market every day of the week. Now that I know that I'll be eating it much more frequently. Yum.
",1
"If you like chevre, you have to try the chevre from Crow's Dairy. I'm ridiculously hooked on it. So is my almost 8-year-old daughter, to the point where I sometimes hide the chevre in the fridge for fear she'll eat too much of it before I get to it. I've had both the plain and peppercorn, which are fantastic on wheat crackers. I've also tried the quark, which I like to smooth over a toasted bagel, and the feta, which is great.  But the chevre is my first and best love from Crow's Dairy, and whenever I need chevre, I try to make a trip to the farmer's market rather than buy it from a store, as the store-bought stuff is never as fresh and tasty.
",1
"As a long time lover of great cheeses, and especially feta, there is no place better to get your cheese from than Crow's Dairy.I have tried almost all of the different kinds they make and I think the worst part is picking which one to buy.  The regular feta and the peppercorn feta are two of my must-haves.  The peppercorn gives a nice little kick thats great paired with tomatoes and cucumbers.  Also, the chevres are creamy and so delicious.  If you are looking for more of a sweet treat from your cheese, definitely try the butter pecan.  It tastes like a delicious cheesecake and I could literally eat an entire container by itself in one sitting (thank God for self-control, right)I would say that worst thing about Crow's Dairy cheese is that I have to wait until the weekend Farmer's Market to get it!
",1
"Do you like feta or cheve goat cheese Crow's Dairy makes the beat cheese ever! They also started making gelato that is to die for! While their cheese is used in a lot of restaurants, you can also find them at a ton of farmer's markets. If you see them around, definitely try it!!

"Hands down, the best milk I have ever tasted! If you live in Estrella Mountain Ranch, Verrado, Litchfield Park, Buckeye, Goodyear or Avondale - this family owned and run farm is just a few minutes away in Rainbow Valley! We just returned home with 2 gallons of vat-pasteurized goat milk that I'm sure won't last the week. If the only goat milk you've had is from the grocery store, you've never had good goat milk. Call Wendell (623-WENDELL) during the week, and you can make an appointment on Saturday morning to visit the dairy and purchase milk, goat cheese, or anything else they have made fresh that week. We've also had their ricotta and ice cream, which was absolutely delicious. On our first visit, Wendell gave us a mini-tour to show us how they care for the goats and their milk. It's a permanent part of our Saturday morning routine, now! They do recommend you bring an ice chest - we haven't yet but we live really close in EMR. Stop by and visit - you'll wonder what you waited for!
",1
"I only wish I could find more of their products. YUMMY! A word to all: SUPPORT YOUR SMALL LOCAL BUSINESSES. You will get fresher, healthier food and keep more of each dollar you spend in your community. Good job, Crow's Dairy. I love your goat products. Let me know if you make ice cream. I'll be the first to go out and buy it!

"Tasty, somewhat gourmet sandwiches.  Hot.  Cold.  You name it.  Great little sides as well.  Subway this place is not.  Also, doubles as a respectable little deli.  If you didn't think you spending enough money on cheese, stop in here and buy some $14 havarti.

"Simply mah-vo-lis. Divine sandwiches and deli salads. They can be a little slow with the hot sandwiches but are well worth the wait. Besides, you get to play Trivial Pursuit while you wait. And I always buy my cheese there...and then buy some wine down the street at Barriques.

"May be the only place in the valley that carries Jamon Serrano.Not to mention the deliciously perfect artisinal chorizo.I love this place!  Just keep me away from all of the awesome cheese!

"My boyfriend, his sister, and I were planning to eat at Settebello this past Sunday. We got there a lil bit too early (just before they opened at noon), so we stopped into Valley Cheese & Wine just across the parking lot. My boyfriend was really impressed by their collection of Mollydooker wines. We'll definitely be back for some tastings & to pick up some bottles.

"Bob and Kristin really know their stuff.  Just about every time we've been into the shop, we've asked for a recommendation for something new and they've never lead us astray.  Excellent selection of wines, cheeses and other delectable snacks.

"five stars to the owners who really know their stuffs!!! they're really friendly.five stars to their selection of wines!and last but not least to their cheese and dry goodstheir chorizo is soooo good. have u tried their boucheron cheese the best i've tried in a long time, paired it with their really expensive crackers, i dont remember the name but they're artisan from california!oohhh and buy their truffled honey and pour it on top of brie cheese.ohh that's heaven!
",1
"This place rocks!  I am glad that I work nearby because otherwise I might not have found it... the parking lot is a bit large and desolate which only adds to the feeling like you have found somewhere special and perhaps unknown by many.  I met Bob, the owner, and he was so helpful and friendly.  He even told me exactly how to use an oil that I purchased from him and showed me some of the cool things he has picked up from around the world that are not for sale.  This place is charming and a great place to find cool and unusual things in commercialized Las Vegas.  Oui, oui!
",1
"This is my favorite place to shop for wine, cheese and specialty gifts for friends. I subscribe to their newsletter. Kristen and Bob email customers when they have farm-fresh eggs or carrots in, or special cheeses. They also host classes about wine and cheese. One class is on wines under $20 (or something like that). Class sizes are small and they pair wines with delicious meats and cheeses. Shopping here costs me half the time as when I look for wines at Trader Joes or Lees because everything is delicious and you can count on Bob and Kristen for suggestions. We are so lucky to have this shop in Henderson. I suggest dropping in on Fridays or Saturdays between 4 and 7. That's when they have wine tastings.
",1
"Best wine and cheese shop in the Valley, hands down, thanks to the knowledge and care of the owners, Bob and Kristin. Other local stores might carry bigger selections or beat prices by a dollar or two, but Bob and Kristin will make sure you get the most for your money thanks to their personal recommendations and their desire to get to know each customer and their tastes. Their Thursday wine classes are highly recommended, too, and definitely check out their free tastings on Fridays and Saturdays.
",1
"Alas, I moved away from the valley over a year ago and I miss Bob and Kristin!!!!!! I only wish I could clone them and spread their copies across to other statescitiesregions to impart their wealth of knowledge on wines, food and beer. Couple that with a passion for all things food and a cool mid-western friendliness....*sigh*. I can't say enough good things about them. Las Vegas is lucky to have two of the most genuine and passionate people about food and wine. Anyone who hasn't visited their shop - much less talked to them asking them for any help.....well, they're just missing out, aren't theySure, you can get some of the same stuff elsewhere....but you really miss out on the character and the ambiance here. They are soooooooo nice and will entertain your questions no matter how naive they are. Every week (FriSat), they have wine tastings and they offer monthly classes (sign up early bc they fill up fast!) on wine - from $20 to $50 per class. Sign up for the email newsletters too - you get the latest offerings from new seasonal wines, cheeses, candies, etc. Want to request something Or try the latest and greatest cheese Ask them! They even cut the cheese to your order - I wanted a small sliver just for myself and they had no problem. Want a gift basket for friends and family Yup, they do that too. Kristin will hand select items for you (even if you don't know what you want).....but they are SOOOOOOO accommodating and friendly that you don't have to worry about feeling intimidated by their selection.Ride your bike all over town and just need a place to rest They do that too! I'm serious. I used to ride my bicycle on Saturdays tofrom Lake Mead in the sweltering dry heat of the LV summer. On the way back, I'd stop by their shop and they always offered me a glass of water and let me park my bike inside while I shopped. When I moved away, they even recommended places where I could get great cheeses and wines!Send in the clones!!!!!

"This great little shop is out of the way for most people (located on Horizon Ridge and Valle Verde), but it is definitely the best place to shop for cheeses and cured meats in Las Vegas. The owners are helpful and the selection is vast. They recently added ""to go"" farm baskets full of organic vegetables so you can get almost everything you need for a dinner right here. Plus, they have wine tasting classes. Be sure to get the artisan zzang chocolate bars. They're fantastic.

"My Kiwanis club decided to have a Wine Tasting social, and the girl who volunteered to put the event together did a google search and found Valley Cheese & Wine for the location.  Little did she know that she had stumbled upon an amazing gem of a local business in the Vegas area. Please bear with me because this experience is being recalled from over a year ago-I just thought I'd Yelp about it because it is the reason I keep going back to this store! About twelve people from our club RSVP'd and showed up for the event.  We had a private wine tasting class in the back room-Intro to Wine Tasting or something like that.  Bob was very friendly and unpretentious which is important because some people like to be Wine Snobs which is a total turn-off. He started off talking about various kinds of glassware and how it affects flavor of the wine-demonstrating this to us with a sparkling wine in two different glasses. We journeyed from sparkling white wine all the way through the reds and ended with a dessert wine.  We also got to try some amazing cheeses and meats, and olives that were to DIE for (lucques, I believe).  In the end we received a discount on our purchases from the evening (EVERYTHING WE TASTED!) and I also bought some international treats from the shelf.   The shop had a great selection of treats from all over the world, and it reminded me of a locally owned Trader Joes-without the crazy nazi vegan hipsters running the place.  (I can't impress how friendly and NORMAL everyone in the shop is!)I also signed up for the newsletter which comes regularly.  They have frequent events and tasting classes you can sign up for-and the newsletter educates you a little on new products in the shop or upcoming events.  They also save your purchase history so you can buy the same or similar wines when you come back.  I also like that I can describe a wine and Bob or his wife can ask you some smart questions to recommend a similar wine-and sometimes it is better than the one you were trying to get!Support local businesses-they need our help, especially in this economy! :)  Valley Cheese & Wine is definitely worth the trip!

"This is by far and away my favorite theater in Pittsburgh! If you've ever been here you KNOW how beautiful it is! It's a historic landmark and was built in 1927 and restored in the 80's to it's original state. It holds around 2,200 seats and is the third largest stage in the country. As you can see, I'm a total nerd about this theater.So let me give you some BIG insider tips about seating! Avoid at all costs the outer sides of the Left and Right Orchestra (the floor) in the front. You can actually get a cheap seat if you sit in the back of the Left and Right sides but only sit on the aisle. IF an aisle seat isn't available, go for First or Second Tier. I would rather see the show from far away than half see the show! The touring Broadway, Pittsburgh CLO, Pittsburgh Opera and Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre perform here. So go support our local theater! Just remember it's right here in the burgh, it's still a fantastic production and it's cheaper than a trip to NYC!

"Perfect Valentine's day date experience. I decided to book tickets for the Dracula Saturday Matinee so that we could have a night out on the town after the show. This theater is really exquisite! Prepare to go back in time to the decadence of the 1920's.Marble, sconces, crystal chandeliers, staircases, and brass railings adorn the beautiful space. Take some time after the performance to tour the interior rooms!The ballet was immensely enjoyable in it's own right. The back drops dark, sinister, and ethereal all at the same time. The dancers floating gracefully around the stage as if their feet fluttered just above the ground. Classical music flowed into the hall and moved with the performers during the most intense scenes. It was so romantic. I can't wait to go again!Pricing is quite reasonable too. You can go for the cheap seats for $20 on the top tier left or right of the center. $50 for better seating towards the center or orchestra seating for $90 being the best seat in the house. I love that on the website you can choose your own seats. Parking can be found two blocks away for $5 at the parking garage. Take some time out to visit this theater!

"The Benedum Center for the Performing Arts was originally a movie theater called The Stanley. It was built in 1927 and was billed as ""Pittsburgh's Palace of Amusement."" It's acoustics are nearly perfect because back when it was built, 65 cents would not only buy you a ""photoplay"", but you'd also get live entertainment too. A two year renovation in the late 1980s under the guidelines of the U.S. Department of the Interior brought it back to its original condition. The grand lobby's mirrors and woodwork are all original. Of the more than 90 chandeliers and sconces in the theater, only one is a replica. In fact, the main chandelier weighs 4,700 pounds and is 20 feet high and 12 feet wide. The sightlines here are awesome. It truly is a masterpiece of theater design. Let's face it fellow Yelpers, you're not here for my architectural reviews are you Okay. I came here last night for the Decemberists concert featuring Justin Townes Earle as the opener. There were only single seats left when I tried to get tickets. So I ended up going by myself to the show. Hey a married babe can treat herself to a night out on occasion! The Portland, OR based Decemberists have been burning up the indie rock scene for a few years now and their CD ""The King Is Dead"" has been doing quite well. So much so that it reached 1 on the Billboard Charts in late January. The Decemberists in the past have dabbled in so-called ""progressive rock"" and British folk but this new CD is definitely more of an AmericanaAlt Country sound. So much so that the single ""Down by the Water"" reminds me of Firetown's ""The Good Life"" for some reason (Firetown later evolved into Garbage--in both senses of the word.. But that's another story). So it was no surprise that after doing ""The Crane Wife, Parts 1-3"", Colin Meloy told the audience ""I don't know who wrote the set list, but they thought we were a prog band. We're not a prog band anymore. We're a folk band."" Hmmm! That actually was a pretty apt description. Despite this, they managed to get a lot of songs in from their catalogue. There was plenty of good singin' and good playin' though. Sam Watkins of Nickel Creek played fiddle against Jenny Conlee's accordion and they did a rousing Irish jig to the song ""Rox in the Box"". It was almost strange though how Meloy apologized for taking the tempo down a notch during the gorgeous new song ""Rise to Me"". They also did their most epic pieces in the middle of the show, and face it folks, you can't keep a good prog band down! But anyway, this show proved that the Decemberists aren't some flash in the pan. Their many musical stylings and their abililty to move a show along proves that they're in it for the long haul. I should also mention that my 60-something father, a music fan in his own right, absolutely loves the Decemberists. Now you know where I get those genes from. As I mentioned, Justin Townes Earle opened the show and if his last name sounds familiar, it should. His father is the iconic Steve Earle (another one of my favorites). Justin gets his middle name Townes, from Townes Van Zandt, of whom Steve Earle was a great friend. Justin Townes Earle is definitely more bluesy than his old man and while he seems to be a good performer, only time will tell if he lives up to the musical legacy of his father.

"I always love coming to the Benedum.  We attended Wicked on a recent Sunday night.  I am always astounded by the beauty of this theater.  Here are a couple interesting facts:  The mirrors, marble and woodwork in the Grand Lobby are all original.  There are over 90 crystal chandeliers, torchieres and sconces in the theater, all but one are original.  The original cost was $3 million back in 1928.  Compare that to the 1987 restoration that cost $43 million.  We had perfect seats, Row AA.  How lucky is that  Loved the performance.  My first time for Wicked.  But just as entertaining is the view of theater.  Love it here.  So beautiful and so ornate.  And while the seats are showing some signs of wear, the good news is the 2,881 seats will be repaired and refurbished to the tune of $450,000.You know, it always feels really special here.  No matter what event we attend.  Looking forward to coming back during the holiday season.

"Saw Phantom when it came through. Grew up seeing Nutcracker every year. JC Superstar was awesome. Beautiful place and Pittsburgh is soooo lucky to have it!

"I love it here! It is like walking into a little piece of history, I could see the upper crusts socializing in here back in the day. Furs and fedoras, and those long cigarette holders gracing the hallways. This is a gorgeous theater its hard to capture it with pictures because of lighting glares. I have not experienced large playhouses in other cities. But my advice is pick a show you love a decent Broadway one, splurge once a year it will make your experience that much more memorable. Spend a little extra for refreshments yes they are expensive but again the experience. I don't think the upper seats are bad but some on yelp seem to, if it is what you can afford it is still a nice view. And unlike Heinz hall you have a little leg room. There are always a few audience members behaving naughty that was my only complaint. The ushers are helpful and will let you in if you are few minutes late (Grrr that Pittsburgh parking), speaking of parking I would park at the 9th and Penn garage or the one on liberty and ninth if you can. I appreciate this theater for its history and modern contributions, I think some individuals do not understand that this kind of history in other American cities has been left to decay. Cue in Detroit, sadly. So props to cultural trust or whomever for keeping this one going.... true Pittsburgh beauty,

"I was lucky to get a tour of the Benedum last month, and I was completely impressed.  This is a painstakingly restored historic building with marvelous architectural and design details.  It is absolutely an beautiful place to go see a musical, the opera, ballet, or a concert.  The staff is amazing and extremely professional, they run this place like clockwork.  I love the natural acoustics of the building, although I don't recommend that you sit under the balcony, that's the worst place to hear a good sound.  Don't worry about getting over-dressed for an event at the Benedum, this is a truly unique and beautiful landmark that exudes elegance.

"Most Charlotteans don't realize that we have such a fabulous ballet company in residence here in our fair city. It is led by Artistic director Jean Pierre Bonnefoux and his wife Patricia McBride who are world renowned for dancing in the New York City Ballet under George Balanchine. What does that mean for non dance connoisseurs It means young dancers want to come to NCDT from all over the world (literally) to dance under their tutelage which translates to a better experience for patrons.NCDT has always has a great reputation for modern contemporary ballets, but they also excel at classic, storybook ballets like Romeo & Juliet, and funny children's ballets like Cinderella. But their sweet spot (and why they attracted resident choreographer Dwight Rhoden who you may have seen on So You Think You Can Dance) is the innovative contemporary works. In fact their annual Innovative Works in late fall often sells out. It features several short pieces that often have a theme or message.  My favorite piece, Satto, was featured again recently in Director's Choice was originally an Innovative Work. Another one they debuted this year had two male artists partnering with Anna Gerberich and never let her feet touch the ground the whole time. The artists and choreographers ebb and flow but you're always going to see a great show with a wide variety of styles. You may not like every single piece, but at least they're conversation pieces. Similarly, you're not going to love every painting in the Mint. It's worth seeing something other than Nutcracker, so dive in, the water's fine.If I have any complaint, it's that every dancer has a different stylestrength and Jean Pierre seems to have favorite principals that he sometimes over casts. Kind of like John Fox.I grew up watching such dance companies as the SF ballet, Bolshoi, Joffrey Ballet, ODC, Alvin Ailey and the CincinnatiSan Jose ballets so this ain't my first rodeo.Ladies, one more selling point in two words: eye candy. Glistening, muscular athletic men often dancing shirtless. I'm just saying. Sue me.

"Opera is Fun! Yes it is! Tosca yesterday was amazing! I was riveted through the whole thing - and at almost 4 hours (including 2 intermissions), that's saying something. I was wowed by the singing, enjoyed the sets, was impressed by the acting, and intrigued by the story. Floria Tosca was superb, Scarpia and Spoletto deliciously evil. Honestly, I did not expect to LIKE opera as much as I have, but I've been enthralled with both AZ Opera performances I've seen this year (The Mikado and Tosca), particularly Tosca. After the performance an opera Q&A session was held for anyone wishing to stay. The AZ opera head and tenor James Flora answered questions about everything from the set, the director's mindset, the Spoletto character's triumphant ending, and the future of opera in the United States.

"Maybe I gave this one too many stars because nothing compares with Houston's Grand Opera, but the Arizona Opera is still good and definitely worth seeing.Hint:  If you come at 6 pm instead of when it starts at 7 pm you can hear a talk about the opera, which will help you understand it better if you're a newbie!  Cool, huhRegardless, you're either going to just love opera or hate it.  I'm a lover = season tickets which includes the price of the parking garage at $8 (compared to $10 at the local garages).  I think the total bill ran $130 or $150.  So worth it if you are one of the opera lovers!

"We have seen Aida on three occasions, once several years ago in Phoenix, once in Prague and yesterday again in Phoenix. My wife and I both agreed, this was the best performance we have seem so far of this wonderful opera. One thing we left with... we hope we get to see it again and we hope when that time comes, we will enjoy it as much as yesterday.We will continue to support Arizona Opera and hope others do as well. The performances are outstanding. Keep up the good work!!!!

"Bravo! Lucia di Lammermoor.If you enjoy opera, don't miss this wonderful performance put on by the Arizona Opera. This was my first ""Lucia"" and it greatly surpassed my expectations. It is definitely an opera I would enjoy again. We are so fortunate to have this available to us here in Phoenix. We flew out to LA to see La Boheme a few months ago and my wife and I both agreed that LA Opera doesn't have anything over the Arizona Opera. Keep up the good work folks!
",1
"I love going to the opera. I am always impressed with the vocal range of the performers. They can do amazing things with their voices! And the sets and costumes are so elaborate. That is the best part. Even though they are usually sung in a language that I don't understand, you can really get swept up in the emotion of the music. I usually read the program beforehand so that I know what's going on and then try my best not to stay fixated on the subtitles on the screen but instead just enjoy the action on the stage, the orchestra, and of course the singing.
",1
"I took my girlfriend here for a performance of Romeo & Juliet. This was our second time going to the Opera (we saw Faust last year through Yelp).  Both performances we have seen here have been excellent - the cast is great and the location is very convenient. This time our seats were very close, which maybe was a bit too close. There is a large board above the stage that provides translations (and since I speak English and she speaks Spanish it would be helpful). Our seats were really too close to benefit from seeing the screen. Fortunately the cast does an excellent job at bringing delivering the emotions of the scene well even if the audience doesn't know the language. The coffeedrink bars and the props from other shows in the lobby also provide good relief during the intermissions. The restrooms seem to move quicker than they do at other theaters in the area. Both times have been excellent and we will definitely return.

"I saw Tosca here last season and loved it.  The electronic subtitles are great, as otherwise I would be lost.  The acoustics in the Symphony Hall are awesome and my seats were smack dab in the middle of the room with the perfect view.  I like that you can bring your own bottled water and stuff too.  At least I think you can... no one stopped me or said anything.  I think it's awesome that we have this cultural experience in Phoenix!

"I attended ""La Boheme"" last night and it was beautiful. Gorgeous production - the performances, sets, costumes, everything!  It was glorious.

"La Boheme  was excellent. For all we had to go through to see La Boheme in LA  (traffic) I will take AZ Opera any day. Symphony Hall is a much nicer venue than the LA Opera (smaller and more aisles!). If only the downtown restaurants like the ""Butcher"" were open on Sundays... We could include a nice lunch with a Sunday matinee. Opera has been enduring for a long time. It touches the soul. I wish we had more young people that were willing to give it a try. Support your AZ Opera. It's one of the best deals in town!

"Wow, decent Ballet in Phoenix...pinch me.I have not been in the last year or so to one of the productions, but Ballet Arizona has been a treat under Ib Anderson's direction.  I'm a fan of the classical ballets and have loved their Swan Lake and Giselle productions.  This year's season is ending, so I must repent and make a few shows next year.

"Just saw the all Balanchine program Saturday night -- going back Sunday to see it again!It's AMAZING to me that a ballet company can go from startup  to being a destination company is fewer than 20 years!

"I have done volunteer withe Ballet AZ for the last years.  It is a an accomplished company with a splendid school attached.The first thing I can say is when most regional companies have gotten smaller, Ballet AZ keeps growing. Ib Anderson, the Artistic Director, danced with Balanchine in New York.  He will not do a ballet that he doesn't know he his company can do and do well.  In watching his him work, I feel he has the ability to make everyone in the company feel what they have to offer is of great value from the newest member to the principal dancers.  There is less ""attitude"" in this company than I have ever seen.  The dancers are hard workers who want as good as what Ib asks of them and that is a great deal.  The people you don't see such as the people who do the costumes and the sets  do a remarkable job of making things happen that sometimes start as nothing more as idea of Ib's.When I first started working with this group, i was surprised when I heard people say this and that was as good as they'd seen all over the world.  I am not surprised now.  Ballet AZ has brought together dancers from all over the world due to it's excellent reputation. These professionals have come to take advantage of working in an organization that is striving for something better each production than the one before.   If in some areas, Phoenix has  long way to go in catching up in the arts, the Ballet is not one of them.  We have a fine company here in AZ that continues to excel in presenting varied productions that range from the classics to world premieres.Prices are quite reasonable for what is offered.  There are different packages that make it even more attractive with special prices on certain dates.  Contact the box office abut that.  Another way to see the shows is to join the volunteer organization.  We work hard but the end result is the pleasure of knowing we help make a beautiful thing like Ballet AZ blossom and grow.

"This review is for the current production ending 4509, Masters of Movement.Wow. What a great program.  They led w the classic Les Sylphides, but it was the 2 modern pieces that blew my socks off.  Polyphonia choreographed by Christopher Wheeldon had some incredible movements of balance and dexeterity that I turned to my sis, who was attending with me, and commented, ""I bet you and the Irish Hubbie do that in the bedroom."" The final piece was The Golden Section from the Twyla Tharp ballet The Catherine Wheel. Twyla Tharp collaborates with David Byrne (Talking Heads) = FUUUUNNNN. The energy of that number with the dancers flying and the beat of Byrne's music made that piece my favorite.David Byrne ROCKS.

"My date and I attended the IB Anderson's Nutcracker last night.  I hadn't seen the Nutcracker since I was a little ballerina girl.  It was an absolutely AMAZING performance with stunning set changes.  The dancers were incredible and very fun to watch!  I would recommend this event to people of all ages as a ""Must see"".

"We really enjoy Ballet Arizona productions. We recently saw The Nutcracker - an annual family tradition. They make a few modifications to the program every year. I really liked the tweaks this year. We also happened to attend a showing where Astrit Zejinati and Chelsea Wilcox doing the pas de deux. They were absolutely amazing. Our 5 year old has also been taking ballet lessons at the school there since she was 3.  We think the school is wonderful. They teach classical ballet vocabulary from 3 years old on. They are pretty strict and have a set curriculum. They all wear the same uniform and hairstyle and are strict about it. After the 3 year old class, parent's aren't allowed to watch other than one class per session where they let us all in. So far, from what we've seen though, the curriculum and the teachers are great. They do a lot to improve body control, teach musicality and start them on a course of classical ballet.We're big fans.

"My husband and I recently attended the Balanchine Classics Performance. We thoroughly enjoyed it and loved our 6th row seats at the Phoenix Symphony Hall....just the right distance from the stage.The orchestra.....Phoenix Symphony Orchestra.....were just wonderful and the dancers were amazing!

The music was perfect, the story line was easy to follow, I had received a program before it started, but didn't look at it until intermission and I was able to keep up with everything that was going on.  The dancers, wow just beautiful to watch. Thank you Ballet Arizona for the beautiful performance! Look forward to seeing other productions in the future !

"We went to the ballet on Saturday to see Moulin Roge.  We have attended the ballet for years and this was one of the best performances we have ever seen.

"I received a pair of free tickets through Yelp to see The Nutcracker last Fri. evening.  I was very excited to see this show, since I'd wanted to see it last last year, but couldn't work it out with my (now ex-) boyfriend's schedule.  I'm used to second tier seating at the Benedum, but I was in for a real treat, since the tickets turned out to be for orchestra level (score!).  What a great surprise for my birthday, which happened to be that day!I really enjoyed PBT's performance of The Nutcracker!  Between the dancing, the choreography, and the costumes and scenery, I thought the show was excellent.  I've never seen a live performance of The Nutcracker before, and the last time I saw the movie was in elementary school music class.  Even though it'd been this long, I was able to follow the plot with very few problems.  I enjoyed the Pittsburgh-specific references in PBT's version of the show, which included a setting at a mansion in Shadyside and a Heinz carriage.I thought both acts were very good, and each had advantages.  The first act was easier to follow in terms of the plot, but I enjoyed the dancing better in the second act, which featured more of the principals and soloists.  Although the stage could get a bit crowded during certain scenes, the scenes were ones where it was either appropriate in light of the plot (e.g., the party scene in the first act) or where it was difficult to avoid (the final scene of the dream sequence).  In general, I found the visual impact of the show very pleasing--if you prefer more visually-oriented shows, as my friend who accompanied me does, this show would definitely be your cup of tea.Overall, I found PBT's performance of The Nutcracker to be engaging and enjoyable, and I'd definitely pay to see it again.  While this was the first live ballet performance I've seen, I thought that the dancing, costumes, scenery, and choreography very good to excellent.  I'm glad that this show is a Christmas tradition in Pittsburgh--it's definitely one that I plan on taking advantage of regularly in the future!

"What fun!  My oldest (5) and I ditched daddy and baby sister to come out for the 2014 production of Nutcracker and it was delightful.  Our tickets (thank you Yelp!) were in the orchestra level and we had a great view of the production.  I was surprised at how many other kids were in the theater, and I think for the length and time of night I wouldn't have wanted to take anyone younger than my almost-six-year-old.So, the ballet. It was set in Pittsburgh, which was fun, and there were some additions we hadn't see before, like the mysterious Nephew.  The dancing was wonderful, as expected.  My daughter was confused about the lack of dialog, but the program had a very helpful synopsis that helped her understand what was happening.  The first act was fun, with magic acts, dancing ""dolls"" and of course the fight with the rats and mice, and quite enjoyable.  The ending of the first act was quite soothing, and in the dark theater I admit I was afraid of snoozing!The second act.  The national dances were amazing, especially the arabian dance (Holy cow, talk about amazing abs!!!).  Then it got to the point where the sugar plum fairy danced, then her consort danced, then they danced together, then the fairy danced...and it did drag a little.  I loved the creativity, though, of the carousel, and the imagination of the set and costumes.  There was a part with the lambs that was awfully cute, and we loved watching the kids any time they were on stage.  There were several ""side stories"" going on in the periphery of the stage that you could get absorbed in, and it was just very well done.  Overall, I think that this will now be our Christmas tradition.  It was wonderful.

"My daughter has been to several area dance studios. This is a great studio! The dance teachers are the best - she is in lyrical, jazz, tumbling and hip hop. They are very well trained and create a positive environment while still pushing the kids to do their best.The recital in Dec was beautiful and so professionally done. It was fun to watch and I was very impressed at how many talented dancers there were. The owners work very hard and are passionate about what they do! That is the most important thing to us. It creates a very good environment for the students. I would highly recommend this studio to anyone. It is great now and will only get better as their business grows.Thank you Steppin' Out for providing a great dance studion in the West Valley!

"We love this place!! My daughter started taking BalletJazz classes this year at 4 yrs old. I was nervous because this was her first time taking instruction from a teacher, but she is doing so well. I know that I have her teacher Ms. Marlo to thank for that. She is soooo good with children. All of the teachers I've seen have always had a smile on their face, and you can tell their students love them. Yes, some of the little ones are more ""into"" it than others and some are spinning in circles like one of the other reviewers mentioned, but my 1 priority was for my daughter to have a fun and stress-free time learning how to dance, and that she does! Other places I shopped around at seemed too serious and up-tight. And it is more affordable than a lot of places. Another plus is that fellow parents are very nice and nothing like the crazies on Dance Moms : )
",1
"We really love this studio.  My daughter and son both started taking classes here last fall, and we love everything about it so far.  The recitals are well done, my kids adore their instructors, and they have learned a lot.  There is not a crazy ""dance mom"" culture, but just a great group of involved parents, and there are some very talented dancers here.  I especially appreciate the fact that they have a GREAT boy culture here, and my son adores this about Steppin Out and feels supported and accepted in all of his classes (so far hip hop, tap, and ballet).  In particular, Mr. Gabe's boy's hip hopbreak dance class is an outstanding class with nothing like it anywhere in the West Valley.  We searched high and low for a hip hop class that was geared more toward street style and break dance, and feel so lucky to have found this class!

"Great Studio! Classes are reasonably priced, offer a wide variety of dances including Ballroom, Salsa, Tango, West Coast Swing, and Zumba. Instructors are extremely friendly and great teachers. They have student rates.

"This is our favorite Y so far. Location is convenient and the staffs are really helpful and kids friendly.  My kids are into soccer, swim, basketball, and camp here.  Price are a little high for me being a single mother but everything else is great.

"I have been going to Casey At The Bat since I was 13 years old.  I am now pushing 30.It has changed an itsy bitsy, but really... it's stayed the same in the last 15 years.  Still the same old ratty nets for the batting cage... still the creaky pitching machines, still the same crappy doors that swing open into the main room with the snack area... But you know what.  It's home... and it's not supposed to be glitzy... It's sports, silly.  You're supposed to get dirty!

"Great friendly atmosphere . Low price from batting cages to team enter fees.

"I love this speciality running store!  If you're getting into some regular running, want to start, or need a good pair of running shoes definitely come here and get their expert advice.  They'll get you fitted with a great pair of shoes, have you run for them, and really know their stuff.  There's also a great stock of clothing and accessories.  SRC also offers group runs and put together a great pre race tent for PF Chang's Rock n Roll 12 marathon and maration.  It may be hard to find back in that corner, but definitely try them out!
",1
"I love this place. It is so refreshing to walk into a store and have the employees truly understand and feel passionate about what they do. After living in the neighborhood for 6+ years, I am happy to have the Scottsdale Running Company close by. If you have large or unusual athletic shoe requirements, you will find yourself in for a treat at this store. Forget the big box stores and give SRC a try!
",1
"I have purchased my past two pairs of running shoes from this store and I have no complaints from either of those experiences.  The employees appear to be very knowledgeable and will help you find the most suitable pair of shoes for your running style and price point.  Although the shoe selection here isn't overwhelming, there is a large enough variety to meet the needs of nearly every runner.  Additionally, I never felt as though I was being pushed into the most expensive pair of shoes; that is reassuring because they carry some pretty expensive kicks.  Another great aspect of this neighborhood-type shop is that they offer running groups and training advice.  So if you're thinking of entering some races, or curious about ramping up your mileage the employees here are a great resource to tap into.

"I can't believe the reviews that this place has received so far!  WOW!!I concede, yes it is very expensive when compared to other gyms, but a BMW is expense when compared to a Ford....In my life I've belonged to The Courthouse (tiny gym), LA Fitness, ASU Student Rec Center, Q Fitness (now 24 hour fitness) and the YMCA and I can honestly say that all pale in comparison to this facility.  Quick disclaimer: Not all LifeTime Fitness centers are the same!  The one in Gilbert is great, but not as amazing as this facility.  When I moved to MN (home of LifeTime Fitness) I actually plotted out where we would live based on the proximity to one of their gyms.  The closest one to me is in no way comparable to the facility in Tempe and as a result we are no longer members.  If I lived even remotely close to a facility like this one I would join again in a heartbeat.  Now on to the review.My wife actually signed us up under the family plan without me around.  When she told me how much it was (~$90month for the entire family) I was a bit put back.  But after my first visit I felt the money was well spent and that we were even getting a deal!I often describe this facility as a ""country club"".  Everything about this place is just amazing.Locker Rooms - Incredibly well appointed with a ton of space, a lounge, sauna and steam room.  The lockers are large and their cardkey system saves a lot of time for those of us that always forget to bring a lock with them.Cardio - There's no way anyone can complain about this!  Even at peak times there are almost always machines available in every category (treadmill, bike, elliptical, etc).  The machines are well maintained and the abundance of large screen TVs will keep you distracted from your achy legs.Weight Machines - You name it, they have it.  There are more here than I would ever use, but if you want to work that little muscle that connects those two things that you n ever use, they probably have a machine here to do it.Free Weights - They have a ton of free weights with some set-ups that I have yet to find in other facilities.  Plenty of space to workout and plenty of weights for everyone to use.Basketball - Two full size courts that are open and clean.  Great courts to play on.Squash - Probably my one complaint is that they have squash courts and no racquetball courts.  Of course most would argue that squash is more technical than racquetball and I should get some skill and stop bitching.Rock Climbing - Probably one of the most underused aspects of the gym.  I rarely saw people on this, but is was a heck of a set-up!Tennis - This was extra and since I'm not much of a tennis player I didn't sign up for this feature, but it seemed like a nice facility.Pool - Indoor and outdoor pools, so you can swim all year long.  The outdoor pool had some AMAZING ""scenery"" during the warmer months.  I wouldn't go so far as to compare it to a Vegas hotel pool, but it was darn impressive!Kid Zone - This is one of the things that sold it for us.  The facility for kids was outstanding, with separate areas set up for different ages and an abundance of activities and areas for all kids.  Indoor, lower hood basketball.  Outdoor play area.  Huge indoor ""jungle gym"".  Computers.  Crafts.  This truly was an amazing part of the gym.  And the great thing is, if you want to relax instead of work out, this aspect of the gym becomes even more helpful!  You want to get a haircut and a massage  Drop the kids off and head to the spa!  You want to sit back and relax  Drop the kids off and head to the pool or hot tub.  The kids look forward to it and it's great for the parents!Spa - My wife used this more than me and was happy with the experiences that she had here.  We didn't use it as much as we could have, but no complaints.Cafe - Decent food for a little cafe in a gym.  I ate many a breakfast there on my way to work after a cardio session.  Overall I just don't think that I've ever been in a better gym.  Yes it's expensive, but even at a higher price I feel as if I always got a good deal for the money I spent.

"God Bless Lifetime Fitness.First off, let me tell you how much I despise working out.  Like, at times I'd rather drink my own pee than even come within 50 feet of the stair stepper.  However, LTF (have you noticed that I like to abbreviate  Get used to it friends...)  makes my gym experience fairly painless.  Steve W, I salute you for aknowledging the value of such a fine work-out establishment, and I actually have many of the same opinions. But because I like to hear myself talk, I'll reiterate some of my favorite points.First off, I'm absolutely not a fan of children.  Especially at a gym.  Lifetime has FREE childcare for kiddos 12 and under so us singles can flirt our way through our workout without your kids sniffling and screaming.  Kids can play and swim outside under parental supervision at the pool, complete with waterslides and some kid-specifc water fountain spray thing.  They love it.  And I do too.  WATERSLIDES  I mean come on.  LoveitLoveit.Lifetime's members span the board, which is nice because I like the fact that I'm not the most out of shape person there.  I also like that there is nice scenery to watch and inspire me to keep my feet on that god forsaken stair stepper.  You may even see a professional athelete or TV personality on occasion.  Who doesnt love thatYou never wait for a piece of equipement because there are tons of machines.  And they are not covered in meathead sweat, which is always nice.My favorite part of LTF is the group classes.  Excellent teachers, classes every day of the week, and a good variety of options.  I'd like to see more coreographed classes like Hip-Hop, but whatever, Kickboxing Jam is pretty damn close.   Locker rooms are always spotless, towel service is free, sauna and steam rooms arent full of weirdo naked people, and they have this device that dries your bathing suit in under a minute.  Ingenious!  I've been a member of a ton of Scottsdale gyms but I drive the extra 20 minutes in rush hour to go to the Tempe LTF.  Doesnt road rage burn calories anyway  Win-win situation.
",1
"I'm in love with LTF.  When I joined, I was just over 300 lbs and terribly out of shape.  But I never felt out of place or uncomfortable.  There were plenty of people in all stages of fitness, so I didn't stand out at all.   That helped tremendously!Most of the classes are mulit-level, so you can join in and work on your fitness level without feeling intimidated.  The Hydro Training class is amazing!  Classes are scheduled 7 days a week, with hours to fit all schedules.  Instructors are helpful and motivating, never judgemental.My son is 12, so he's old enough to do his own thing.  I never worry about his safety in this huge facility.  I don't have a lot of experience with the childcare, but I've heard nothing but positives.  I only WISH this place had been around when my son was younger!The facility is always clean and even at peek times there are plenty of machines available.  They limit enrollment to ensure this.It may be a bit on the pricey side as far as most gyms go but the services and amenities are FAR FAR superior to any other gym in my experience.  Tons of classes, indooroutdoor pools with slides, hot tubs, saunas, steam rooms, nice locker rooms, free towel service, tennis, racquetball, squash, rock climbing, basketball, volleyball, spa, cafe, etc etc etc.  What more could anyone want  I'd gladly pay twice as much for all that we enjoy at LTF!  It keeps me motivated and interested in a variety of workout options, which keeps me coming back regularly.

"Ok I am poor...and Lifetime is the reason for it.  But you know what...I don't care...I heart LIfetime Fitness.  It is the only gym that I actually feel comfortable working out in.  They never tried to upsell me on packages.  My sales manager (who works in Scottsdale) is the best.  But on top of everything else...I love my trainer.  (this is why I am poor...but I love him so)  He is the best and believe me...when the manager was choosing a trainer for me...they knew what they were doing.   Matt is the best.  He is so worth it.I am going to have my first experience with the classes tomorrow, and I have signed up for volleyball. (hint hint...they need more players)  The lifespa is awesome, and the Life Cafe has the best Chicken Pesto sandwich in the world.  Everybody is so friendly there...and the whole gym is extremely clean...another thing that I like.  I cannot complain in the least.

"I pay almost $120 month in fees for our family of 5 but it is sooooo worth it.  Just the two hours per day of free childcare for my 3 kiddos is worth it.  I love the group fitness classes, the place is always clean and pretty well stocked.  The cafe has yummy smoothies and the pool is lush.  What else could you ask for in a gym
",1
"This gym has spoiled me. They have all the right classes at all the right times. even when it's packed, there's always an open machine. sometimes there's a wait for the weight machines. the  locker rooms are always super clean. and the staff is just awesome. totally worth the $50 membership!
",1
"I love this place. So very clean, professional staff, and a ton of machines so you NEVER have to wait for anything. Locker rooms have hair dryers, towels and a wet sauna. Outside there is the pool area with chairs for napping, lanes for swimming laps, areas for smaller kids and also a slide!Spa offers massages, facials, haircuts, etc.Lifecafe has shakes to sandwichs to googles if you're like me and forget them at home.
",1
"I'm really happy with this gym.  Would highly recommend it to anyone, the group fitness classes alone are worth the membership costs even if you only go a few times a month.I also like the LifeCafe restaurant inside...I love the pesto chicken salad (if you need extra protein after your workout tell them to throw in some spicy peanuts ...sooo good with that salad.)
",1
"Lifetime fitness is the bomb. How do I know this Because I have worked out at probably 100 different gyms during my 8 years of traveling the country playing minor league baseball. At Lifetime you get what you pay for and Lifetime is not cheap. It's always meticulously clean, stocked with towels and has plenty of free and pay for classes if you like classes. If you wanted to, you could literally spend the whole day at Lifetime at have everything you need from the cafe, pool, child care (max 2 hours), hair and nail salon, free WiFi, lounging area in the locker room with couches and a flat screen TV, Jacuzzi, sauna, etc, etc, etc. If you don't mind the price, 40mnth for a basic membership, you will love Lifetime and never want to work out anywhere else.

"I took my 2 sons here to try out the batting cages.  This place is AMAZING!  The staff is great, it is wonderful environment and my kids have so much fun in the batting cages!  We also have done lessons, and will continue to do them.  it is amazing how much they have learned from just a few months of WOB training.  I would HIGHLY recommend it!

"I was driving by the baseball school a few weeks ago with my sons Neil and Joel, and i asked them if they wanted to check it out, and my oh my did they have the day of their lives. They already knew how to hit balls, but now they really smack 'em! my sons have been asking me everyday when we get to go back next. so I love this place, makes my daddy duties easier!

"Better than video games! I take my boys there and they love it! It's airconditioned and great exercise. They are continually improving and excited about little league next year.

"I'm a single mother and brought my small son in to World of Baseball to see if someone could help him, as I had no clue how to teach him to hit a ball. The guys who work there were so excited about a little guy wanting to play and took us straight away into a hitting room to hit off of a tee. We came in a few days a week for about half an hour and practiced hitting on the tee but he was getting a bit bored. The instructor noticed his lack of excitement at the tee and changed up the teaching. By the end of the second week my little son was in the batting cage (of course, the slowest one) hitting balls! He wasn't scared, he wasn't nervous, he wasn't upset when he missed! The guys made sure the pitching machine was set perfectly for his size and everyone was super excited for him when he hit one, then two, three, four, five and six balls! I couldn't believe it! The older kids in there training are very kind to my son and I, they are super encouraging and excited to see such a little boy in with them doing ""big boy"" things. We're going to be there every week forever! My son LOOOOVES it and said he wants to ""wiv [live] at the baseball school.

"This is more than a bunch of batting cages.  This is where you learn to hit.  Wolfe is my son's instructor, he is a natural coach, you can tell he loves baseball and hitting.  They have an area for soft toss, tee, and live pitching as well as machines.  If  you have a membership it's all available to you whenever you want, not just during lessons.

"I'm over in Arizona from Ireland for a few weeks work and as i play hurling in Ireland I always wanted to have a go at baseball so I dropped by here for the closest thing to it! This place was as we say in Ireland ""Un-Feckin-Real""...!! The guys working there deserve a lot of credit as they were willing to point a baseball virgin like me in the right direction to pop my batting cherry..! They chose a suitable bat for me and after two or three shots advised me that I needed to switch my hands which made a huge difference to my batting! I would and most likely will be back numerous times before I ship back out to Ireland as this place is top notch in every aspect.
",1
"Never mind what I have to say...my Kid loves this place! Whether swinging by to hit balls in the cages or for baseball camp my youngest thinks this place ROCKS! Oh, in the summer, this is the coolest place in town. AC and batting cages are a blessing during 110 degree days. The staff is always helpful, they treat the kids well even while maintaining a little baseball tradition of goofing on ya a bit. It's perfect for both boys and young ladies. Great skill and confidence building. We'll be signing up for some private coaching this year. Hopefully with Coach Dude"" or Coach ""Redbeard""

"The very first time I got together for Thanksgiving with my boyfriend's entire family we went to see the Penguins.  We had awesome seats, awesome service and a nice surprise when a Welcome sign with the family's names came up on the screen.  Even though they lost by 1 in OT, it was an awesome experience to see such die-hard fans with their families around the holidays.

"IMO hockey is the single greatest sport to watch live.  It is fast, physical, the game can turn on an instant, can be offensively explosive or a defensive struggle, and the fans at a hockey game are ""highly emotional"".The Pens and their fans have come a long way and right now they are one of the best fan bases in the NHL.On a side note, IMO, the nacho's at the Mellon Arena are the best nacho's in the world.  Maybe it has something to do with the environment.

"Always a fave even from the days of the original powder blues of Les Binkley, Ron Shock and Ken Schinkel. Throw in the ultra yellow unis when Mario came aboard and hoo ha, lookin' good there, Randy Carlyle.Loved the fact during the Cup years they were the first team with a bunch of players with big 's (55 Larry Murphy, 92 Rick Tocchet, 68 Jaromir Jagr and 66). Had a blast at the Igloo--great location, cool design. Hope the new arena measures up.Now throw in Sydney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin nowadays and it's a team that always is entertaining to watch. As the beloved Bob Johnson said, ""It's a great day for hockey"" and it always is when the Pens take to the ice.

"First off, I will have to say that i am not into professional sports. Or actually, I take that back and say that until I moved to Pittsburgh, I was not into professional sports. Then I moved from Hawaii to Pittsburgh, PA and my opinion and my world was changed forever.I have lived in Pittsburgh for 10 years and when I moved here, i knew what I getting into moving into a sports town. In Hawaii, the only thing sports-wise is college sports. There are no professional teams at all. I was very reluctant to give any of my attention to the Steelers. Why I don't particularly care for football. Then something changed... I casually started watching Penguins hockey games. When I say casually, I mean whenever I saw there was one on TV and there was nothing else to watch. And then after the lockout, things changed. I started watching any hockey games whenever they were on. Now, I am so addicted that hockey has really become such an important aspect in my life. Everything else now takes a backseat to hockey. I actually started dating a guy who did not like *any* sports on TV but now loves the Penguins too. I have to say that over the last few years, the Penguins have brought so much joy into my life and I am so happy that they won the Stanley Cup while I was living here. I don't know how long I'll be living in Pittsburgh but I do know that I will be a Penguins fan for life. Let's go Pens! Thanks for the memories and I look forward to many more!

"What a fun night!  6 to 3 win over the Thrashers, and all the fans threw their hats just in case Crosby had a hat trick (which it looked like he did for a moment).  The first period was so action packed that I thought to myself even if they lost I would still enjoy every minute of the game; however, thank the hockey lord they didn't lose, because that makes it even better!!!!  The Penguins have sold out every game for the last 188 games they announced.  It is truly a fun experience to be right there watching the players in action.  No fights tonight... that was my only minor grumble.  If you can (and buy your tickets early), so to a game!!!!
",1
"Yes, the Steel City is known for football. But three Stanley Cups ain't shabby.The Penguins as an organization are awesome. They do numerous charity events and take being part of the community seriously. For all the problems with young players in professional sports leagues (cough, Ben cough), the Penguins have strayed away from the drama.As for the hockey itself, its great. The new era of HCDB and young core makes this team exciting to watch and reinvigorates the sport itself.If you go to Consolieum, eat some nachos (filling and worth their price) and get some cotton candy from the old cotton candy man (oh, you will know who I'm talkin' bout when you get there) and enjoy the game!Side note: There has been criticism about the location of the arena in the immediate neighborhood, but other problems have plagued the area, which I find difficult to pin on one hockey organization (as the arena is used for much more than just hockey.)

"Favorite sports team of all time! Growing up I liked sports...loved boys playing sports and after trying my hand at cheerleading decided I didn't fit in with the conformation of cheering in a group. I was the bane of the squad because I actually watched the game and jumped up out of turn to go crazy and scream during riveting finals tournaments. Yup I ""ruined the cheer!!""  I was too hyper to be a cheerleader and ended up becoming a stats girl instead. A much better role, for when the game was nail bitingly close I could yell and jump to my hearts content. This being said I love watching sports and Hockey was the logical choice, that would make it the ultimate sports viewing experience, in my eyes. I mean hockey guys kick ass, the skills it takes ice skating with that tiny puck, the fighting COME ON! In college and highschool I went to many games and when I moved to Pittsburgh going to the Pens games became one of the best times I would look forward to. When I first moved we weren't doing so hot so the games were affordable, and easily attended. So my love of the Pens did not grow from fair weathered admiration. We have the best team in the league and soon after,  we won the cup!! Love, love, love! It's such a ""livable"" city that it's possible to run into these athletes all over town! I won't give away where I've seen practically the whole team on many nights surrounded by puck bunnies sooo...get out there!  It's fun to see that SOME of them are respectable young men and behave, unlike many the football player. Sorry Stillers the Pens are number 1!! Lets go Pens!

"My 350th review goes to my second favorite sports team, the Pens. Talk about a team with its ups and downs. Bad owners, bad management, a record of terrible draft picks, even the mascot died! True story, in the early days, when the Penguins wore blue everyday, they had a live penguin who would walk on the ice between periods. Well, it died. A promising rookie also died the same year in a car accident. The Penguins seemed like a team with a curse attached to it. Until...In 1984 the Penguins were the worst team in the league, finishing dead last. But what a year to finish last. We earned the first pick in the entry draft which brought current co-owner and the greatest player to ever lace up skates, Mario Lemieux. Finally, our luck was changing, and Mario brought two Stanley Cups to the City of Champions. But, again, the curse was back, more bad management, bad draft picks, and chapter eleven gave Mario the chance to co-own the team. Could history repeat itself Again, the Penguins were one of the worst teams in the league, and winning the draft lottery, earned the right to draft Sydney Crosby. A year earlier they drafted Geeno Malkin. Giving them the two best players in hockey. A few years later, Sid the Kid hoisted the Stanley Cup and brought Pittsburgh It's third cup. Then, the Penguin's home began to crumble and needed a new place to play. Kansas City lured the Pens with a new hockey rink, Las Vegas also wanted them. Could we lose our Pens Finally the city and state came up with the cash to build the Penguins their new home! Now, lets bring the Cup back to Pittsburgh and party all summer long!

"If you're headed to Scottsdale and looking to play some golf make a trip out to Quintero Golf and Country Club. This course is a little ways off the beaten track but it will be an experience you'll remember. (Temporary clubhouse only). This course is semi-private and if you're not a member you need to buy a ""Troon card"" to be able to make a tee time. Worth every penny though because it is rated in the""top 100"" courses in America and truly a remarkable golf experience.
",1
"They just opened it to the public. They limit the number of tee times so play was very fast. The greens were very very fast. In my oppinion its the best course in the west valley.
",1
"This course has been on my radar for awhile, but just a bit out of my price range, but I decided to make this a ""tax return splurge"" for myself, and could NOT be happier with my decision!  Every hole is different.  The staff is excellent.  The greens, while a little marked up, putted true and very fast.  And at a rate of $110 from their own website (booked a week in advance and cheaper than golfnow, btw), it's a far better value than your standard North Scottsdale courses, and equal to, or superior in quality.  A couple negatives; sand was a bit compacted and a couple tee boxes were hard to find a level spot.  Also, if the ball gets into the desert, get a new one.      I will play this one more time in ""season"", and several times this summer.  Don't miss this.  It will eventually go totally private at some point.

"Played 36 holes here with a group of friends on a golf trip recently. This is by far the best course we played during the trip. We rented a house in Cave Creek so the drive was about 35 minutes to Quintero....so worth it.This Rees Jones designed course is a challenge, fair, incredibly well laid out, and an amazing value. We played the Grayhawk Raptor course and I can say without question Quintero puts it to shame for the money. Grayhawk is a great layout but for the money it is not even close. If you are into golf and in the area do yourself a favor and make the trip to Quintero.

"Absolutely beautiful course.  One of the nicest I've ever played at!

"I always take my golf visiting buddies to this BEAUTIFUL golf course.  Yes, it's a little further out but it's well worth the drive.  Immaculate course, great layout & terrific service.  (Troon Golf should send this team to Troon North  to teach the boys at TNa little about how to deliver great customer service!). My favorite public course in AZ.  2  Dove mountain.  3  Boulders South.  Sorry Troon North .  You need to improve service. at every level, to make your way back to the top, inspite of your beautiful courses!

"I've had the pleasure of playing Quintero twice, and when ever I go to AZ I will make it a point to play there again. It is my favorite course in the area, and I always recommend it to friends that are traveling in AZ.Fain EFairfield, CA

"This place rocks!.  Every hole looks like another high end course's signature hole.  We loved everything about this place from the service, to the driving range and the GPS on the carts, etc.  Also the cart girls were perky and friendly.  One even helped us find a lost ball and gave my buddy a couple of Pro V1s.  Probably the best course we have played.

"Best public course in Phoenix in my opinion!   Every hole is picturesque and feels like what desert golf should be: penalties for missing but not so narrow that you have to hit an iron off every tee.  The elevation changes make the course a joy to play and has been in great shape every time I've played it.   The only annoyance is the drive in the cart from the club house to the first tee.  Cool factor for having a gold simulator in the bar now!!!

"This is a beautiful and we'll manicured golf course.  It is quite a drive to get there and a ten minute drive to get to the first hole . There are only about 6 homes on the entire course.  There are many  holes with tremendous elevation changes on the par threes. It is a tough course but fair. There are very few players and the pace of play is good unless your game is off. Their food is excellent and reasonably priced

"WOW...was all i can say.Its only water spraying out, but if u really get into it.. its very touching and romantic.  The music, water, the bellagio..speechless.

"I would like a job choreographing the water.  How does one make that happenI'm a fan of the Sinatra and some of the opera routines, but the other ones have got to go. (Bleh.)I've already choreogrpahed a number to 'Clark Gable' by The Postal Service.And I seriously need a job.  This one would be perfect if it wasn't in Las Vegas.  (Bleh.)
",1
"My first experience was during the day and I was on the side of Bellagio and facing the Eiffel Tower. That was pretty wonderful and I got some great shots. They played a Sinatra song and towards the end I (and everybody standing near me) got a light ""Bellagio fountain"" shower.... that was unexpected, but... felt kind of good!The second experience was at night and I was on the other side (next to fountains, but on the Paris side). The show was lovely and Bellagio looked quite lovely all lit up. More great pictures, no shower, but the song they chose was some super-patriotic one that I didn't like that much. Ah well.The shows are very short, but I think they're definitely worth the ~5 minutes of standing and watching.
",1
"oh dear fountains....you were a wonderful companion My room at the Bellagio gave me a wonderful view of you at all hours of the day....your many songs and beautiful lights enticed me everytimeI was very sad when it was too windy for you to come out and play
",1
"Time to say goodbye........that's all I'm sayin...........gives me goosebumps...this fountain soothes my soul.
",1
"Great lighting, great music, great choreography. I stayed at the Bellagio and found myself walking to S Vegas Blvd just to check out the fountain show. If you enjoy the show check out the Fontana Bar inside of the Bellagio and request for outside seating, trust me you wont be disappointed.
",1
"This is one of those things you simply must see in Las Vegas.  Of the free experiences on the Las Vegas Strip, this is the best.There are several songs that they rotate, and the show takes place every 15 minutes during the day and into the evening.  If you stay in one of The Bellagio rooms facing the fountain, you can listen to the music on your television.5 stars for being amazing.

"huge amount of water, wasted, in desert, free. unbeatable deal for a show, unbelievable when you think about where you are seeing this. The shows are every hour on weekdays and every half hour on weekends. See it several times during the evening since the lighting is creative and the soundtrack changes with every show.
",1
"This is by far the classiest thing in Las Vegas.And it's free. I would probably pay to see this, but I'm glad that I don't have to.
",1
"Its a MUST if your on the strip! Its awesome to see. me and the hubby always come to watch everytime we are in vegas...If you can check out the show from the eiffel tower! ITS AWESOME at night! and you can get some beautiful pictures. By the way....the show ends at midnight...We learned this the hard way...We stood there from 2am to 330am waiting for the show...lol...what dumb asses...but hey believe it or not we were not the only ones waiting..lol....they should seriously consider posting a sign somewhere...lol...

"My husband and I stayed here for a weekend getaway. What a neat place! It's a european style hotel (read very nice but smaller rooms). It used to be a monestary back in the day. Built around the turn of the century, it has neat large old molding and furnishings. Owner was very nice, offers complimentary wine in the evening and good full continental breakfast. All of that for only $135 a night! A short ride from everything. Includes free parking.

"I was so lucky to stumble upon the Priory! I came to Pittsburgh for a conference. The Westin at the convention center was booked, so I had to find alternative lodging and came across this place. I love this hotel.  The historic building is beautiful.  The beds are comfortable. The staff are very friendly and helpful.  They have a wonderful free continental breakfast in the morning.  It's near bars and restaurants, a nail salon, and a grocery store (I was surprised to find that beer is not sold in grocery stores in Pennsylvania.  Luckily, you can buy a variety of chilled beers at the front desk, which is open 24 hrs). The local pizza place delivers until 2 am.  It's walking distance to the Andy Warhol Museum.  Also, it's only a 2 minute drive from the convention center and much cheaper than the Westin.  I paid $105night. The tv was very small and the water pressure was weak, but everything else exceeded my expectations.
",1
"We love the Priory!I don't remember how we found this place, but I feel so lucky we did.  A beautiful restoration of a lovely old building, the Priory is a comfortable, tasteful, beautiful hotel in a convenient part of the city.  We found the staff to be very friendly and accommodating, plenty of help and advice for weary holiday travelers, always delivered with a smile.  We will return to the Priory.

"One thing Pittsburgh is not known for, but should be, is turning old churches into businesses, homes and even bars (gasp!).  Most of the churches are so beautiful that it's such a great use of space.  This is no exception, as it's just so unique inside! If you're looking for that nontraditional hotel that's NOT a Marriott or Hilton, this is the place you'll want to stay!  It's fashioned like a European boutique hotel, plus all the amenities you'd be looking for like WiFi, a shuttle and continental breakfast (score!). It's also a really lovely place to have an event.  For smaller events you can rent out specific parlor's for a reasonable cost and you're able to bring in your own caterers.  I really like this option because you're not boxed into one choice that may be out of price range.  If I would have gotten married in Pittsburgh, this would  definitely have been my first choice for the reception.  The Grand Hall is just gorgeous!  It has the original church organ and stain glass windows.  When it's all dressed up for the event it's just a stunning place for a magical affair! The Northside of town, where it's located, has walkable access to the Andy Warhol Museum, The Mattress Factory Museum, The Children's Museum, The National Aviary, The Carnegie Science Center, PNC Park (home to the Pirates, go bucks!) and Heinz Field (home to the Stillerz, as we call them in the burgh).  Some are farther than others, but there's always the shuttle if it's in our frigid winter season.  In the summer, go for the walk so you can take in the sights!There's also a lot of cute restaurants and bars on East Ohio River Boulevard, which is two streets up from the hotel.  My suggestions would be Bistro to Go and Bistro Soul, Rita's Italian Ice (personal fave) or The Priory Bakery for dessert!  There's also Legends North Shore not far on E. North Ave. about two streets up from E. Ohio and Amani Coffee Shop and Cafe for a quick stop for coffee or a great panini for lunch.   It's really a fantastic time to go in the summer because EVERYTHING is within walking distance.  Plus they have a great farmers market in the park right along E. Ohio and they have kayaking in the park right by the Aviary.  The big kayaking organization, Venture Outdoors is right under the 6th St. Bridge next to PNC Park.  You're able to kayak around the three rivers for only $15 an hour!  It's a great way to see the city!This is your place for one unique stay, I wouldn't steer you wrong!

"We've stayed here twice during recent trips to Pittsburgh, and while the city itself is a bit hit and miss, the Priory is always comfortable and welcoming. A great place to escape after a long drive or a stressful drive around the maze of roads and traffic that make up Pittsburgh.Each room is pretty unique and always well appointed and very clean. The staff are friendly and helpful with whatever you might need and it's an easy drive to most of the attractions around town.

"Stayed here for several days during a very rainy time. The hotel is great, very charming, and fun to stay at. Definitely not your typical chain hotel, as it's an old-style mansion.The continental breakfast was delicious, the hotel staff was very friendly and helpful, the amenities were wonderful (fast wifi!!). Like others said, it felt more like you were part of a fun community due to the interactions with the staff, the small great bar downstairs, and the welcoming atmosphere. The fitness center was well equipped as well, and there was a great complimentary shuttle. The driver would not only take us to restaurants, but would suggest other cool places to visit. Overall I could not recommend this more. The only ""negative"" is the area where it is doesn't have many other fun places - but they ARE a short drive away.

"Great european style boutique hotel.  You can not beat this hotel for the money!

"I've attended two weddings here.  Both have been amazing.  The facility is really nice.  The bathrooms are nice.Where this place shines is the food.  The food I've had at the weddings has been amazing.  The steaks are well prepared, the chicken is awesome, and the mushroom entry for vegetarians is amazing.  Both wedding cakes (vanilla and red velvet) have also been awesome.I don't know anything about price, but I really enjoy attending weddings here.

"The banana cream pie pancakes are awesome! All the food was delicious though. It's crazy that they don't take reservations but it was worth the wait.

"Without a doubt one of the nicest places I have ever had the pleasure of laying my head......having wine and cheese.......or breakfasting.The Inn on Negley is gorgeously appointed.  The individual rooms, all named for varieties of apple, are spectacular.  We were in the lovely Northern Spy.  The bed was wonderfully comfortable, the linens unbelievably soft and luxurious.  L'Occitane bath products smelled divine.  The Shadyside neighborhood outside of downtown is quiet but still conveniently located to all the Pittsburgh doings.Breakfast each morning, cooked by the hospitable Chef Jackie, is pure pleasure.  Each night on your pillow a menu card appears; check off what you'd like in the morning, what time you'll be eating, and drop it off in the dining room.  The next day, Jackie is ready and waiting with a fresh fruit plate, the pastry of the day, and fantastically strong and flavorful coffee.  Omelets and fritattas are made with local produce and eggs.  Irish oatmeal is served with milk from a nearby creamery.  Toast bread changes daily but is always whole-grain and delicious.  Breakfast meats are lean and filling.  Afternoons, iced tea and cookies are set out, and in the evenings wine and cheese served.  Enjoy them in a rocker on the front porch, relaxing on the back deck retreat, or in the privacy of your room.  Staff is not only eminently professional, but warm and gracious.  Heidi at the front desk was beyond helpful in making suggestions for what to do in the city or where to eat (I will be forever indebted to her for recommending what was probably our best meal of the trip at Soba).  If you ever find yourself in Pittsburgh, lodgings can't get much better than the Inn on Negley.That's probably sufficient gushing.

"Pittsburgh has a Four Seasons!From Paris to Shanghai, London to Bangkok, the care with which this little B&B operation is run in Pittsburgh exceeds the best that I have experienced in any of these cities.It may not have the conference facilities of a larger hotel, the business center, or in-house spa, but as a B&B, this is about as good as it gets. The structure in which the whole thing is held (do we call it a 'house') is old (perhaps we could say it generically to be 'victorian') with decor to match. These are far from our tastes, but they compensate (in our eyes) by taking good care of what they have. The TVs aren't even old flat screens, but they do stock the rooms thoroughly with l'occitane.Where this place really shines is in the staff and the food. I actually find this aspect to be _better_ or even _much_ better than many celebrated big-city five-star properties. When was the last time that the night staff pulled some food from the refrigerator (gratis) after a midnight arrival caused by flight delaysThey make everything in-house and it is all extraordinary. On this last visit, I indulged in their traditional french toast with a side of eggs. I forgot that this all includes an additional course in advance with fruit (not just big grocery store chucks of melon) and house-made cookies and muffins. On each visit, they mix these up. For this December visit, they did gingerbread cookies (of course). The Chef (Jackie), from NYC, could be gainfully employed high up the hierarchy of any top big-city restaurant.There is no elevator, so either pack light if you want a room on the 3rd floor or choose a 1st or 2nd floor room. The 1st floor room has double doors so I didn't find it any noisier than the others. You are in a city and on a reasonably busy street, so don't expect the charming home to be continued into a surrounding yard (although they do have an attractive new deck out back).

"Amazing!I recently hosted my friend's bridal shower here and everything was absolutely perfect!  Heidi went above and beyond helping me plan from 3 hours away, including taking pictures of the tea room and promptly responding to my many many emails. The Inn itself is gorgeous, and the staff was extremely professional and accommodating. A++++!!!

"just returned from a three day weekend at the inn with 12 sorority sisters from around the country.  It is understandable why the inn gets such rave reviews.  From the extraordinary service of the staff which was both accommodating AND anticipating, to the beautifully furnished and outfitted rooms  (I stayed in the Braeburn on the first floor which was large, comfortable, and filled with light), to the delicious breakfasts, it was an outstanding experience all around.  I am thrilled to spread the word and recommend your inn without reservation.

"What a wonderful location!  My sister's future MIL hosted her bridal shower here and with 11 people, we had our own private room.  It was tastefully decorated and beautiful.  The Inn on Negley also has a private parking lot in the back meant for their guests but street parking is plentiful around there, as well.The tea room is simply gorgeous and the variety of tea is plentiful and delicious!  They even had a blue & yellow tea for us (the bride's wedding colors) and I loved the fact that we could request a different type of tea the second time around.  The food was delicious from the cucumber finger sandwiches to the apricot scones.What a lovely spot for afternoon tea and I look forward to returning again to Pittsburgh - may want to stay there next time!

"I requested a stay at the Inn on Negley when traveling on business back to Pittsburgh.  I lived in town for 5 years and had not had an opportunity to return in more years than that I am afraid. This place was just what I needed. I sought a more personal experience than a canned commercial hotel could offer.I was so grateful to get to stay in this pristine, classy, comfortable Inn. The staff was welcoming, sweet, helpful, and kind. The room was lovely. The best part was waking up in the morning! Breakfast made me feel like a queen on her birthday. The food was perfect. Gorgeous and delicious. The carefully cut fresh fruit salad, coffee, french toast option, and housemade pastries were top shelf! The  creative meals and fresh ingredients were professionally planned, carefully prepared, and out of this world! I bought my host a gift certificate for brunch in thanks just so he could share in how fabulous the treatment is. I'd return in a heartbeat.

"Went for brunch with a group of ladies and we had a great time!  The inn is really lovely and it's a great if you want to try something new or different for brunch!Service is impeccable and the whole atmosphere is just so elegant!  The brunch service is basically a four course meal: fruit, breads, entree, dessert!  And you also have you choice of juices, coffee andor tea!All the things we tried were delicious!  There were so many things, I can barely remember.  They also serve Afternoon Tea, which I'm sure is fabulous!!! So, that's definitely next on my list!

"First time having Afternoon tea time in the States. This place is very beautifully decorated. We had the Earl Grey and peach ginger tea. They were really good and the tea stand was AMAZING

"We absolutely loved our stay at the Inn on Negley!! There is so much to review and not enough space to do it. We stayed in the Cortland suite which was so comfortable and quiet. It was a room off by itself which I was unaware of at the time of booking. That made it so much better. The bed was extremely comfortable, the bathroom was spacious and the decor was spectacular. The only part I didn't quite like was the street noise early in the morning. The breakfast was insanely good with so many choices other than the typical continental. There were eggs, belgian waffles, pancakes, etc to choose from. Each morning breakfast began with a cup of fresh cut up fruit and a freshly baked pastry. The service was perfect with the proper amount of attention without being too invasive. The staff was one of the most polite and courteous I've ever encountered. Thank you so much for making our stay perfect. I hope to visit again some day.

"As a non-native Pittsburgher, I would say the Sunnyledge brunch tops Grand Concourse.  Not in the quantity, but in the service and the ambience.  It's funny how often I passed by this place turning onto Fifth coming down from Wilkins, but didn't try it until my last weekend in Pittsburgh.I came here on my last Sunday in Pittsburgh after I had posted a list of things I wanted to do before leaving.  The Sunnyledge owner offered a deal and graciously gave the 4 of us a round of mimosas.  Along with this deal, we had an incredible brunch.The 4 of us were sat on the porch, overlooking Fifth which wasn't that loud.  The brunch came with an entree and a buffet.  I love perfectly-sized portions and this one was it.  I had a lobster club sandwich which was great.  The brunch buffet was held in a room in the lobby, which was quaint and small.  Caviar.  Small pastries.  Just the perfect balance of sweet and savory.  Even though the crowd here were a little more upscale and classy (one of the few places that I saw valet parking), I never felt that I was treated any less (I was a poor graduate student with a love of food).The only drawback was that the tables and chairs were somewhat cramped.  I had to struggle with getting out of my chair each time to go to the buffet.  But this was a small negative compared to my experience at Sunnyledge.I hear that Sunnyledge is known for their cocktails as well as their stay.  Next time I am in Pittsburgh, I would like to try out the boutique hotel.  But until then, I would highly recommend this brunch.

"My aunt was visiting from Chicago and booked a room at the Inn after the Vanlandingham estate (which is a sister business to the Morehead Inn) said they were full.When I dropped her off, I went inside to check it out, and I'm glad I did.  It's truly an amazing house.   Walking around the place, you can really start to feel as if you've gone back in time.  I only saw one guest room, but it was impressive.  very well appointed with antique furniture, it had a separate sitting room with its own couch, and the views were of the thick stand of trees to the east and south of the house.I also really liked the enclosure of live australian finches downstairs.  They're colorful, lively things to watch, and I was told that sometimes the cat they keep around the house just sits around staring at the birds.Anyway, if you've got guest coming from out of town who are into antique and ornate surroundings, they would do well to stay at the Morehead Inn.

"This place is so relaxing and quiet. The staff is very nice and accommodating. The grounds are very beautiful and I was able to walk to a nearby shopping center without any issue. I am staying in a room that has a balcony and a swing - so relaxing. Very nice B&B. Fits well into the southern hospitality feel of Charlotte.
",1
"If you need a place for a company get together, this is it!  I was able to visit The Morehead Inn for a small company meeting of around 20 people and it was nice and cozy in the room they provided us with.When I first arrived, I noticed how it the plants were well kept and there wasn't that much parking.  If you come here, I would highly recommend carpooling.  From the parking lot, I was able to walk right to the conference room they had for us.  As soon as I walked in, I felt like I went back in time.  The decorations there were beautiful and made me feel like I had to drink tea with my pinky out.  The only gripe I have about their decorations was that they had plates with Slytherin colors.  How can they support the evil house in Harry Potter!!!  Other than that, everything was perfect.They do not have that many bathrooms, but it is understandable since it is an old house.  I wouldn't want them to change that anyways.  I wasn't able to explore more in the Inn, but all the things I was able to see I loved.  The staff was also very friendly, so kudos to that!

"I have no idea why no one has reviewed this awesome B&B but i'm excited to be the first...perhaps no one wants to let anyone in on the secret...and i thought about not writing the review for that same reason but i have to share this one with my fellow yelpsters. I wanted to celebrate the wife's bday with a quick getaway but didn't want to stay in the usual hotel. so i popped ""lgbt friendly B&Bs"" into google and this place came up. they had a few rooms to choose from but of course the one with the hot tub in the room caught my eye first. i emailed them through the website and the owner Craig got back to me quickly. I reserved the room and then just had to wait until the day arrived. Even though we were arriving earlier than the 3PM check in, Craig was awesome and left a personalized letter and the keys to the house in the mailbox for us to let ourselves in. we put our stuff in the room and when we came downstairs the owners, Craig and Cathy were there and welcomed us to the house, even remembering that we were there for a surprise birthday trip. the house was clean and the room was nicely done. it was definitely more cozy than any hotel room could have ever been, the bed was so comfortable we almost napped thru our dinner reservation! the hot tub was definitely the highlight of the Mentor room, the massage jets were awesome and were so relaxing! in the AM Craig made an awesome breakfast complete with bacon, an egg souffle and a homemade Kringle that was absolutely delish! i couldn't have picked a better place to celebrate my gf's birthday! from the second i made the reservation until the moment we checked out, Craig and Cathy made us feel at home and provided top knotch service to us. If I'm ever in need of a quick getaway to Madison I know exactly where I will stay!!

"Goodbye Hotels!  After this cozy little place I'm a bed and breakfast faithful.  Our host, Craig, was wonderful.  It was super easy to make the arrangements and the website was helpful.  The place itself gave me the same joy I remember having when I would go see grandparents as a child.  That feeling of a warm house.  Oh, did I mention that when we first entered the whole house smelled of breakfast from that morning.  The bed half of the name was extra comfortable and the room was very relaxing.  We stayed in the Sorenson room, which was a little larger and had a couch.  They offered a small bookshelf of books and Madison magazine (which helped us to find our restaurant the next day).  The Sorenson room also offers a private bathroom with a claw-foot tub that is over 110 years old (but has excellent water pressure).  Shampoo, soap, body gel, bath salts (I think that's what they were), and even a hairdryer are all provided.  This was nice since we forgot a couple of those things.  For the breakfast portion, we had a spinach and cheddar quiche that was the fluffiest damn quiche I've ever had.  Pardon my French! My fiance is a Vegetarian and it was extremely easy to make.  He also had a myriad of drink options.  Some ready to be poured, some in waiting.  Also, for me (the non-vegetarian), he made an incredible side of bacon.  It was sprinkled with brown sugar and then generously peppered.  Then it was baked.  Then it was devoured with great speed.  Seriously, this was heavenly.  Also, there was a delicious pear and cranberry compote for each of us. Craig and his beautiful (and friendly) dog joined us for breakfast and some wonderful conversation.  He is a true gentleman and an excellent host.  My fiance and I are planning another trip in the spring and we'll be sure to stay with them again.  I could't recommend this place enough.

"What a wonderful place Craig runs! So happy we chose to stay at The Parsonage for a girls weekend to Madison.The highlights:- Location: While the B&B is about 25 minutes from downtown Madison, it's very easy to get to. The perk of being off the beaten path is, well, being off the beaten path. - Price: The three of us chose the top floor Reverend's Retreat, which can actually sleep up to 6. It had the feel of your parent's attic, but in a good, comfortable way. For the Friday & Saturday night, it was about comparable to what we would've paid to stay at a fancy-pants place in Madison.- Food: Oh my goodness, can Craig cook! The breakfasts alone would've been worth $20person at a restaurant. Definitely try the juice blend - you won't look at orange and cranberry juice the same way again. - The company: On the weekend we were there, we (late 20searly 30s) had the pleasure of staying with younger groups of people. Chatting at the communal breakfast table was a nice perk and a great way to get some new tips on what to see & do in Madison. And, Craig and his wife have two lovely dogs. If you're in town, definitely look up & consider The Parsonage.

"My 8 year old daughter and I stayed at the B&B this past weekend.  We stayed in the Sorenson room which was the right size for us.  It had an attached, good sized bathroom which was great, and my daughter loved that she got to take a bath in a tub that was over 100 years old.  (The water pressure is great by the way).  There was an assortment of soaps, shampoos, bubble baths etc in the bathroom too.  The room and bathroom were clean and spotless.  Craig was extremely nice, helpful, and whipped up a killer breakfast.... a brown sugary, apple, cranberry, upside down baked french toast kind of concoction, homemade pumpkin bread, fresh watermelon, and sausage links.  He was very accomodating and asked us the night before if there were any allergies or food issues that he needed to know about.  The price was very affordable, and the next time I'm in the area I'll be staying there instead of a hotel.  : )

"Loved staying here.  We were going up to Madison for the day and found this place through a quick Google search of Madison-area B&B's.  Craig (the owner) was so helpful and friendly when I called to inquire about prices and availability.  He was also awesome and asked about our dietary preferences (I'm a vegetarian who's also temporarily gluten-free, whereas my boyfriend will eat anything) and promised to have a yummy breakfast we would both love.  When we got to The Parsonage, I was so happy we decided to stay there instead of in Madison proper.  It was quiet and cozy.  We picked the Mentor room which had a big awesome jacuzzi tub in there, and also a really nice outdoor patio (which was covered in snow, but i bet will be awesome when spring comes!).   Our bed was SO COMFORTABLE, i think i actually miss it.  Since our room didn't have a shower (which we knew when we booked - well worth it to have that awesome bathtub!), I used the shared bathroom on the second floor which was also very nice and cozy.  Breakfast the next day was so nice.  Craig made homemade cranberry orange muffins with a cheesy kale egg dish - so yummy!  Everyone else got delicious smelling bacon, and Craig very awesomely made me veggie breakfast sausage.  There was also pineapple, juice, and a really great tea selection.  The conversation was also really nice - I like that we all ate together (me, my boyfriend, Craig, and the 5 other guests who were staying there.  Great people and great company.  Next time we are in the Madison area, we will definitely stay here.  Craig, thanks for all the hospitality!  From Denise and Justin

"Parsonage was a perfect fit for my recent trip. What it is: warm, quaint, charmingly old, affordable, homey, accommodating of diet. What it is not: posh, uber-modern, sleek, extravagant.Has wifi. Has a (very well-mannered & clean) dog. Street parking. Does not have private bathrooms for each room, so be sure to check on that when booking if it's important to you.Craig the owner and Coriander the springer spaniel were a warm greeting party. Craig went out of his way to make me feel comfortable with the house, the amenities, where to find him if I needed something, etc. I called him later that night after I realized I had accidentally left without a key, and he told me exactly where he would hide one outside for my return. It felt less like paid lodging, and more like staying with distant relatives. Our group had some gluten-sensitive members and some lactose-sensitive members, so Craig made sure that each breakfast had options for everyone. One morning, the power went out around 5am before he could cook the breakfast casserole, so he ran down to a bakery and brought back an improvised meal of fruits and a kringle (), a local specialty. The weather was nice, so we spent plenty of time on his newly renovated screened-in porch listening to music while we sipped coffee and rubbed Coriander's belly.

"This may be the nicest, most relaxing B&B my wife and I have ever stayed in.  We have stayed there about three times when we make an annual pilgrimage to Madison for a gardening conference at Olbrich.It's in a farm house lovingly converted to a B&B.  The owners are lovely, friendly people and excellent cooks too!  One morning we were the only couple at breakfast and the food was fabulous!!!Their dog was present while we had breakfast; that makes it seem more like home.  I wish that the llamas would come over to the fence so I could pet them.Check out their web site at speckledheninn.com

"This place is fantastic. The owners are friendly and personable but not overbearing. Happy, their golden doodle dog, is the sweetest and most welcoming ""greeter"" on the planet, yet - again - not overbearing. Guests receive a lovely, multi-course gourmet breakfast, and the ownerchef cheerfully accomodated my request for a gluten-free, vegan meal! The grounds are lovely ... there are lambs and llamas (no joke!) ... one has use of a mini kitchen and a nice little guest hangout area, in addition to one's nice, homey room. We had a jacuzzi in our room. We had no qualms or problems during our stay, at all - this is the comfiest B&B ever!

"My husband surprised me with a little getaway for my birthday and a wonderful stay at the Speckled Hen Inn B&B. We have some experience with B&Bs and this one is very nice. The Innkeepers are friendly, kind, and like others have said, not overbearing. It's located on a small farm that has sheep, llamas (or they may have been alpacas), chickens, a very cute dog named Happy, and some outdoor cats. The farm house where the guests stay is tastefully decorated. There is a nice living area and a library area where you can lounge about. There is also a mini kitchen you can use, if needed, with snacks. Our room was a very good size and it was neat and clean. We had a tv and dvd player with movies to choose from. I also noticed how nice and quite it was. 4 of the 5 rooms were filled while we were there and yet it was always very quiet in our room. The breakfast was wonderful! The owners are very good cooks and served us 2-3 courses for breakfast. Some of the food we ate, like the eggs and some fruits were straight from the farm. Free WiFi was another convenient bonus. If you're looking for a romantic getaway I would highly recommend staying at the Speckled Hen Inn!

"This place is, amazing.  The owners are very welcoming, and when you eat breakfast it is like you are sitting in your parent's dinning room.  The room we stayed in was beautiful.  It had a huge showersteam room, mini bar, great TV with satellite, fire place, and a bed that swallows you.  There are other features to this B&B other than the place itself.  As mentioned, there is the most amazing dog EVER here, properly named ""Happy"".  There are also a handful of amazing cats on the property that will gladly accompany you for a stroll on the property.  It's nice to hear that the B&B is also pretty sustainable.  All the food they make is pretty much from their farmgarden (fresh eggs, veggies) and anything that can not be grown on their property is from close by.  We have stayed at a handful of B&Bs but this one takes the cake.  I would recommend The Speckled Hen Inn B&B to anyone.  I couldn't even wait to leave our room to post this review!

"I should have left this review back in November when I stayed here with my parents - every time I look through our vacation photos I think about how much fun I had showing them Madison... and how we enjoyed where we stayed just as much.  Pat and Bob and Happy (their dog) were wonderful and their food was amazing.  They make many of the ingredients on their property (fresh maple syrup anyone).  Would go back in a heartbeat.

"By far the best B & B I have stayed in (I have stayed in about 5 in my life thus far). Huge breakfasts that were yummy and a lovely, relaxing atmosphere. My co-traveler and I honestly decided to stay in the inn rather than go into Madison on a Saturday night because it was that cozy. We are not 80 but in our late 20searly 30s!You can hear the highway when you sit outside, but it's kind of like the sound of strong winds. It's hard to believe that the property is that close to downtown Madison, yet it's a farm. Although I like to try out different B & B's, just for different experiences, I would strongly consider staying there again for a weekend getaway.

"My business partner and I stayed at the Speckled Hen by chance while on business in Madison.  All hotels were booked and we were lucky enough to get a room here.  I can't say enough about this B&B.  We were overly impressed with the Inn, the Inn Keepers, our rooms and the breakfasts OMG!!! Awesome ;)   I felt at home here, my room was extremely comfy and cozy and quiet.  Breakfast is served in your time and is one of my favorite parts of the stay.  Every morning its something new and exciting and Delicious!!!  The Inn Keepers and warm and friendly and the conversation was never dull.  I will stay here whenever I'm in Madison.  The price and the service go way beyond the cost of any hotel I've stayed in...  This place is a real find.  There are also hiking trails, farm animals, and an abundantly beautiful property.  If that isn't enough a good deal of what is served for breakfast is grown on the property.    To say it in one word, AWESOME!!!!!

"This was our first B&B expierence and it was amazing! We stayed here June 2012 for a birthday weekend. The owners made us feel very special and right at home. Our room, the Madison Lakes Room, was huge and the bathroom was spectacular. I loved the steam shower! The property is large and a great place to take a walk during the day. They are also lots of outdoor seating areas to sit and enjoy the scenery or read a book. The breakfast was great, I think we had 3 courses a day of food. Pat makes a great breakfast and Bob provides good company during the meal. Their dog Happy is also a companion while you eat or walk the property. They do also have snacks in the lounge area for you to enjoy at anytime. There are sodas in the fridge and sometimes fresh baked cookies!

"Inviting, comfortable, quite, homey, elegant, and friendly are words that come to mind when thinking of our stay at the Speckled Hen.  My wife and I came here for our anniversary and we were not disappointed with any aspect.   Upon arrival we were met by the Inn Keeper, Pat who gave us a warm welcome and brief tour of the gust areas and our room.   The guest area, or as they call it, the ""gathering room"" is very warm & inviting.   Here you can sit to meet with others, read a book, select a wine, or enjoy complementary drinks such as coffee, tea or soda with some light snacks available as well.   The freshly baked cookies are awesome.    There is also a computer to use if you wish and there are several binders and folders with local attractions or restaurants to try out.   Our room, the ""Madison Lakes"" was outstanding.  Large, and outfitted extremely well. You will not be disappointed.  There is a king sized bed, a gas fireplace, nice sized TV, with good cable channels, or use of a DVD (you can borrow DVD's from the gathering room), free wifi, a small fridge, sink, and two comfortable chairs to melt into.   The bathroom is ginormous, with a large whirlpool tub, a huge walk in shower complete with steam and rainfall shower head, all of it being very nice.   The grounds of the Inn is really a small farm, with fruits, veggies & fresh laid eggs that find their way into the ingredients for breakfast.    Around the far there are several trails to use, winding you past the barn, sheep, a lama and various beds for wild flowers, herbs and vegetables.   As my wife and I walked the grounds and headed back to the Inn, we passed a good sized gazebo which seemed to beckon us in for a look.  Inside there are a few comfortable chairs, wine cooler,  a DVD player (with aux connections) and some wine glasses just waiting to be used.   We sat in there for a while and we actually had plans on going out on the town.  However, this entire scenery before us was extremely relaxing... the woods, birds singing, farm animals grazing about, all made for an extremely, wonderful  relaxing environment we simply could not walk away from.   So, we concluded our evening by enjoying ourselves in this tranquil environment accompanied with some wine.    Ahhh... a very memorable time which we shall cherish for some time to come.   After a sound sleep and outstanding shower, we headed to breakfast where we dinned with two other couples who clearly were enjoying their stay as well.  The breakfast freshly made by the Inn Keepers, Pat & Bob, is made up of several courses; fruit, scones, beacon and eggs, all of which was eaten with delight and a perfect ending chapter of our stay at the Speckled Hen Inn B&B.  The attention given by the Inn Keepers, Pat & Bob is perfect.  They have really taken care of many of your needs in advance simply by setting up the Inn & Grounds really well.  They are both attentive and engaging while at the same time not being overbearing.   They really do have it well balanced!   Obviously, my wife & I will be checking back in here again.  So, if you are looking for a place to get away from to unwind, (which is only a short drive from the Capitol Square) or in need of some quite time, then this is the place for you!   Thanks Speckled Hen, for such a relaxing time and creating some wonderful memories!!!

"This place was wonderful all around. I would return and I would recommend. It is a bit higher price point, but it is such a great space it is worth it. If you are looking to get away, relax, have a romantic weekend, enjoy nature, this is a great place. If you just need a place to sleep you might want something less expensive (unless you can afford it). The first floor of the house is very clean and neat, but has a very comfortable and cozy feel. There is a small kitchenette stocked with coffee, tea, cold drinks and lite snacks. If we stayed longer I could see relaxing down there enjoying a glass of wine, playing a game or reading. There is a nice selection of wine available to purchase so you don't even have to go out. Our room was very nice. King sized bed, robes, our own deck with a great view of the sheep. The bathroom had a big Jacuzzi tub and a large duel-head shower. We enjoyed glasses of champagne on the deck before heading out to explore and hike around their land. He had dinner downtown Madison which was an easy drive to and from. When we returned we were happy to have the fireplace in our room and cozied up with some of freshly baked cookies left out for guests. Breakfast was delicious. Farm fresh eggs from their hen's, herbs from the garden and all the other ingredients were local. We had good conversation with the other couple staying there as well as the owners.Great place!

"An adorable surprise of an Inn in the middle of absolutely nowhere.  I was doing a long-distance bike ride through AZ and booked a room here only bc Florence seemed like a good stopping point before a full-day ride to Tucson.  From the moment I rode up to the entrance of the courtyard, I was astounded.  The courtyard has a tranquil appeal, complete with a water fountain to soothe what ails you.  The room I was in (Dolores) was delightfully decorated and outfitted w the comfiest queen sized bed, TV, fridge, hairdryer, French soaps and shampoo, and vintage bedside reads.  And in the morning, there was breakfast, during which Linda, the owner, offered me extra food to pack for my ride to Tucson.  What a treat to have found this place.  This would be the perfect place to take a quiet long weekend escape from the hustle of life and read, write, breathe and just be still.  I intend to come back soon.

"This is our home away from home! If you ever come near this area, you will not regret staying at the Rancho Sonora. It is a nice place to get together with a family and can accommodate a large group of people.We love staying at their casita, a self standing house. Everything is super clean and tastefully decorated. We stayed twice at Casita-Ilsa. The Ilsa has a full kitchen with a eat-inn counter, TV room, a comfortable bed and large bath tub.There are also affordable motel rooms which are very charming.They also have jacuzzi and pool. My father in-law stays at RV park for winter. He loves the community.I love going there to see him, thanks to the comfortable and welcoming environment they provide there.

"The most relaxing bed and breakfast in Southern Arizona.  Linda, the owner, is wonderful.  She really goes out of her way to make sure you have a comfortable stay.  And her dogs are charming too.  You get so much more than what you pay for.  The breakfast is technically a continental breakfast, but it really leaves you satisfied - yogurt, toast, fruit, juice, coffee, cereal, oatmeal, all kinds of good stuff.  The beds are comfortable and the rooms are spotless.  My favorite feature is the pool area - a two person hammock, spa with a little waterfall, and a grill that guests can use for BBQs.  Lovely place to get away for a night or two...and really feel like you took a vacation.

"I stayed here for a wedding a couple years ago. We rented out the whole place and it was awesome. I would definitely recommend it!

"The Morning Glory Inn is tucked into a cozy neighborhood in the South Side or historic district of Pittsburgh. The owners, Dave and Nancy, go above and beyond to make your stay enjoyable!Nancy cooks an amazing breakfast every morning--pomegranite blueberry juice, fresh brewed coffee with Belgium waffles and fresh fruit the first morning. The second morning, I awoke to fresh squeezed orange juice and lemon souflee pancakes!Whether you are traveling to Pittsburgh for pleasure or business, I would highly recommend this B&B!

"I never actually stayed here myself but I spent a day there for my friend's wedding and reception.  I thought that the place was perfect for the fairytale wedding my friend had always wanted.  Including a balcony full of flower girls dropping rose petals on the bride and groom.  The entire wedding and most of the reception took place outside in the very private very lush courtyard.  I would have never believed that a place so beautiful could exist just behind the busy south side bar scene.  Tucked away like a golden jewel for safekeeping.  The owners were pleasant and completely accommodating.  My friends had booked the entire hotel so we got to go in to all of the rooms. I loved the feel of the place and would love to go back there again soon.  Maybe even get married there someday who knows...

"Hello Chuck, We just wanted to say ""thank you"" again for all you did to make our ""kids"" Mike and Stephanies wedding so lovely and enjoyable. The setting was just out of this world and the pampering was great. I would recommend the Morning Glory to anyone who would want an intimate outdoor wedding.Thanks again.

"Staying at this fine establishment will certainly be a unique and delightful experience for just about anyone.  My entire family loved it, and that's no small statement.  The building itself is absolutely gorgeous with everything from a grand spiraling staircase to stately chandeliers.  The decor is funky, with an occasional leopard print rug and stuffed animal sprinkled throughout the fine Victorian furniture.  You'll have the opportunity to enjoy a lovely little courtyard with a cute little fountain.  The service is the best part.  There's always delicious food available, particularly homemade chocolate chip cookies, and Karl and Jeff, the owners are incredibly thoughtful, accommodating and flexible.

"Stayed at the Inn a few years ago during the holidays and just rebooked for this holiday.  Karl & Jeff are awesome and extremely accommodating. Street parking is always ample.  They let us bring our little dog which was HUGE for us.  I prefer to support independent business rather than supply the (paris) Hilton empire.  If your looking for a no-frills, low key place to stay this is it.

"My husband and I were in Pittsburgh for the NHL Winter Classic on New Year's Day. We spent three nights here and loved it. We had the Mr. Boggs room which faces the street and over looks the park across the street (in the picture, the 3 windows on the second floor are Mr. Boggs room). The room was spacious, clean and comfortable. The entire Inn was beautifully decorated for Christmas. Karl and Jeff are wonderful hosts. We had made dinner reservations at a local restaurant, but upon arrival at the Inn were told that Jeff prepared a special New Year's eve dinner for the guests. He is a wonderful chef...dinner was delicious. The next morning he prepared a special New Year's Day breakfast of quiche and potatoes, in addition to the cold, every day breakfast items the normally serve. The restaurant is only open for private dinners. I suggest taking bottled water, winebeer, sodas & snacks with you, as there is nothing ""right there"" to get those types of things. Free parking on the street and easy walk to downtown and Heinz field. Highly recommend!!

"My wife and I were at the Inn on Mexican War Streets recently for one night, Karl upgraded us and we loved the Inn, our room and the breakfast. After checking in, we went for a self-guided walking tour of the historic district - the people out seemed very friendly.Karl was very nice, answered all kinds of questions, was  of great help with our getting to our dinner reservation (stay off the freeways). The breakfast area was really fun - all self-serve, my wife made herself some waffles - great food.The Inn is located across from a park, which we also explored. Street parking was fine, no problems. Our room (the back big room) was very nice, the high bed was large and amusing. No complaints whatsoever, highly recommend Karl's labor of love (didn't meet his partner), Karl sounds like a real urban pioneer of older Pittsburgh and he was a teacher (I think teachers make great BnB owners) - if we are ever in Pittsburgh again, we will look forward to another stay at the Inn on Mexican War Streets - thanks!

"During my recent visit to Pittsburgh I lived like a baron in the Mr. Boggs' Suite while staying with friends Karl Kargle and his partner in life and business Jeffrey Stasko at the former Boggs Mansion, beautifully restored and now called The Inn on the Mexican War Streets. Once the town home of financier and department store baron Russell H. Boggs, now it's an elegant Bed & Breakfast  rich in character with guest rooms that are as charmingly unique as their new proprieters.My enormous room featured a king size bed, private bathroom with shower, large antique desk, table, marble fireplace, sofa, chair, and what argueably must be the most stunning view of West Park overlooking Lake Elizabeth and the Pittsburgh city skyline.The Scene - Inside and out of the magnificent property is romantic and brooding with a wrought-iron gate standing sentry in front of the imposing stone facade and large front porch, picture-perfect for sitting with old friends over drinks and ideal for meeting new ones.The interior showcases ornate chandeliers, carved fireplaces and while all eight spacious guest and executive suites featuring four-poster beds, private baths, telephones with voice mail & modem port, television, DVD player, on site complimentary movie library,  hair dryer, air conditioning, full access of the mansion's common areas, on site High Speed WiFi, an expanded Continental Breakfast Service and my personal favorite, the famous Chocolate Chip Cookies and snacks service presented every afternoon and evening, all while maintaing the character of a stately private residence from the magnate's opulent era.To experience hospitality that is truly Pittsburgh, your first and only choice in lodging should be the magnificent Inn On The Mexican War Streets located at 604 W.

"My husband and I stayed at The Inn on the Mexican War Streets during our vacation this past week and we absolutely loved it. The Inn itself is gorgeous inside and out and Karl is a fabulous and gracious host. Our room, which included a private bath and sitting area was beautiful, clean, and very comfortable. The free wi-fi came in handy and was easily accessible from our room (the Emma room).Breakfast, though self serve, was good. There is a waffle maker and a toaster for English muffins or bagels. Fruit, pastries, cereal, and yogurt were also available, along with hard-boiled eggs.Street parking was never a problem and we felt very safe while staying at the Inn. We would highly recommend it for anyone visiting the Pittsburgh area.

"My husband and I got married at The Inn on the Mexican War Streets in 2007.  It was everything I could have dreamed of.  We rented 4 rooms total for ourselves plus friends and family.  The owners went above and beyond to make sure our day was amazing.  The rooms were all beautiful, the bar had delicious cocktails, and our dinner was mind-blowing.  There aren't enough words to describe how perfect our day was.  Thank you so much Karl and Jeff!

"My wife and I stayed at the Inn in June and had a fantastic time.  The Inn is beautifully restored and the stay is like traveling back in time to a more graceful era.  Our host, Jeff, was extremely gracious and accommodating.  His chocolate chip cookies were made from scratch and delicious.  Looking at previous reviews, I accessed the Internet and had no trouble.  That said, if you need the Internet that bad, this bed and breakfast would be wasted on you.  The location is great.  We walked to the National Aviary and the river walk and enjoyed the beautiful park across the street.

"I stayed at The Inn on Mexican War Streets for one night in late May, 2014. I stayed in Mr. Bogg's room and felt a bit like a wealthy tycoon in the large grand room!The Inn has a very grand appearance on the outside, which continues on the inside. While not in pristine condition, the inside is certainly not shabby, and is clean. My bed was very comfortable. I met only one of the two innkeepers (sorry, I don't recall his name), but he was very nice and helpful. I wouldn't say the neighborhood is packed with restaurants and bars, but there are several (good ones!) within a three to four block walk. There's also a nice park immediate across the street from the Inn.If I need to return to Pittsburgh, I'll certainly stay at the Inn on Mexican War Streets again (you should too!).

"We recently spent a few nights here and it is amazing!  I felt like we were staying in a museumcastle.  Karl was available to answer any questions and he was very helpful regarding the area and places to go, to eat, etc.  The historic district is very beautiful and we enjoyed walking around.  Everything was within walking distance, including the Aviary, the Children's Museum, the Mattress Factory (an art gallery), Randyland, etc.   There is also a beautiful park right across the road.  Parking was always available and we felt safe throughout the whole city.  We even squeezed in a bit of geocaching.  We highly recommend staying here!

"EXCEPTIONAL accommodations! We were expecting a nice place but this was above and beyond. Great breakfast in the morning with grits that would feel at home on a five star menu. Highly recommend The Duke for a wedding or at least your pictures.One word of warning if you're staying in The Harris or The Van Every rooms... There is a conferencemeeting space across the hall. We stayed during the week and a group of loud businessmen discussing their golf game woke us up at 7:30am. If you need to sleep in, consider the 3rd floor.

"If I could give this place 10 stars, I would.  So for now, just imagine I'm giving it all 5 starts times two :-)There is not enough that I can say about The Duke Mansion.  Anyone looking to escape the hustle and bustle of everyday life, look no further.  The Duke Mansion will transport you back in time, to when life was a bit slower and finer.The rooms at this place are exquisite.  This place is one of rare vintage indeed.  The first thing I noticed about our room was that the ceilings were well over 15 feet high.  You just don't fined places like that anymore.  And the entire mansion is both bright, and spotless.  Very well kept.The grounds are astonishingly well kept.  You can spend an hour walking around the grounds, just adoring the flowers, exotic local birds and landscaping.It's obvious that a lot of people get married at the Duke Mansion, and that's no surprise.  Highly recommend you check this place out if you're getting married in NC, or would be willing to travel to NC to get married, just to do something different for a change.The breakfast was spot on.  Basic Southern food, delicious to the core.  The staff are super friendly.  Typical of the South though :-)Another great facet about the Duke Mansion is it's proximity to downtown Charlotte and other lively, nearby suburban neighborhoods.  It's rare to find a place that seems so isolated (in a good way) but yet offers 15 minute access in any direction to whatever you want to do.TIP: Get either room 204 or 205.  These rooms share the lovely, screened in private balcony.  The balcony overlooks the fountain. It's so peaceful.  And it's massive.  There are both swings and lounge chairs.I will definitely be going back to the Duke Mansion.  This place is heavenly.  Do it!

"Great night out.  I don't know if Christopher Titus set the ticket price or the club did, but at $25 a ticket, we will be going back often.  Great line up of top name acts coming to town.  extremely nice staff. highly recommend.

"A great place to hear local comedy acts as well as some traveling more well known people.  Enjoy the great drinks while being entertained, you can't beat it.  Thursday night there is a $1 cover...can't beat that! Great for that night when you just want to do something different.  5 stars.

"What's not to love about the Comedy Club.  I have been going to this venue for about 5 years now (in their old and new location), and there's only been a few times where I was disappointed.  The new location has a nice huge seating area where you and a group of friends can pay an incredibly small fee to see a great show of standup comedy.Specifically, on Thursdays it's $1 with a Student ID, and Fri-Sun it's $10.  Each of these tickets requires a 2 drink minimum, but you can buy soda if you need to save on cash.  This is a great price, and there's usually 2 or 3 comics at a minimum, with some shows having as many as 6 or 7.  Usually the whole experience takes about an hour and a half to two hours, and you're almost guaranteed to have a riot.  If you look in some of the local papers, they print a coupon every week for a buy one get one free as well, and this place definitely rings true with the saying ""the more the merrier.""  My only recommendation here is to call ahead, as the place can get packed and sometimes they need a reservation depending on the size of your party.I've been to a few other stand up comedy venues in various major cities, and also improv comedy (like Comedy Sportz), but this place stands out because they consistently get funny comics and an excited crowd.  The humor is usually intelligent (at least the headliner), or they throw enough comics at  you that one or two of them is bound to hit your funnybone.  I can't stress enough how good this place is and if you haven't been you should go next weekend.  I've had my share of memories there, from laughing so hard I had to get up and go to the bathroom (on my first date with my girlfriend of 5 years now) to laughing so hard it hurt because a comic rebuked insulting with a tirade that prompted a rude patron to leave.  The atmosphere of people is primarily college and young adults, but there are middle-aged folks as well, and a lot of parents taking their college kids out on the town.  The comedy almost never gets so raunchy that it's offensive, and most comics either have a good skit series off the bat or adapt to the crowd.  Many of them have been on Comedy Central, and several have won comedy awards.  The one thing you shouldn't expect is a giant auditorium with people on the status level of Jerry Seinfeld, but if you just want to go have a good time, laugh your heart out, and have a few drinks, this is the place.

"This place is a gem. I'm now living in Boston and we've struggled to find a good place to go for comedy. We've visited NYC and tried a few there and everything fails to meet our expectations after going to college in Madison.Comedy Club on State is by-far the best stand-up comedy club I've ever gone to. Comedians are excellent. It's in a great space with very comfortable seating. Big drink selection with excellent service. The waitresses come by the perfect amount of times and somehow manage to not interrupt your enjoyment of the show.I've only attended for their main stage shows, so I don't have any feedback on the other acts they host during the week. We'll be going to Comedy Club on State every time we visit Madison. My favorite show was one year when we went to a women's night with all female comedians. That was very fun and different! For the first time, there was some humor that I got that my boyfriend didn't rather than the other way around. :)

"Love this comedy club- not a fan of their 2 drink minimum but glad there isn't a $$ minimum per table. It's is always PACKED when we go...just a testament that they have performers that are funny as f*%&!!!!! ;) Even the ""opening acts"" have all been awesome!!!

"Great comedians at a good price. Drinks are a little pricy but beer is average priced. Always a fun.

"Really, Really had a great time. Great service, great host and great headliner...December 13th I think.The only short-coming was the feature (lead in for headliner) that was from Florida.  He kept complaining how frickin' cold it was outside --- after the second time - the crowd seemed to collectively say 'yeah, we get it - we're from WI and we know it is cold...move on buddy'....things seemed flat for him after that.Great service, good crowd, excellent drink menu (variety) and great host.Nice place - thanks for the laughs!

"My favorite place in Madison. I've been there many times and it's always a blast. I've never been disappointed. I most recently saw Ben Kronberg and the show was amazing as always. Great staff,  great comedians, and great drinks.

"This was my first time to a comedy club and I had a blast! Because I do not have anything to compare it to, I feel I should give The Comedy Spot 5 stars based on my experience last night. Great staff and a fun intimate setting for a comedy show. Here's the deal: 1. You think.... ""Hmm I haven't laughed  or smiled in a awhile, lets go to The Comedy Spot."" 2. Go to the website and print out the coupon online for $2 off admission! (I know what you're thinking...and yes, I am a poor mofo but just do it...why not!) 3. Get there a bit before your showtime since it is 'first come, first serve' seating and come with a group so you an enjoy a booth unless you are down with sitting up front where the 2 top tables are (These were the people that totally got made fun of by one of the comics). 4. Sit your ass down...you waitress should get there shortly so order your drink and enjoy the show!

"I've always wanted to go to this place and finally made it happen this weekend! Last night I gathered my ladies and we went to the 8pm showing. The main comedian was a guy named RON MOREY - who I have never heard of but I'm not too comedian savvy.. and prefer anything other than douche bag Dane Cook-esque comedy. Such a tool. (He's lame and steals jokes from CK Louis btw!)We arrived about twenty minutes early which was good because they don't accept cards at the door, which sorta sucked.. since I thought it was 2009, but whatever. We walked to the nearest ATM, giggling and stumbling slightly due to the martinis (we consumed at Pearl previously) flowing through our veins. We went in, and just as I expected, it was a very intimate place, very cute.. although it was a little warm. We grabbed awesome seats and ordered beverages. There is a two drink minimum but the mix drinks are fairly priced at $5 - non alcoholic drinks are $3. Not bad. The show started a few minutes late but I was immediately pleased. There were three ""opening"" acts which were funny.. but man, the main comedian, RON MOREY, was hilarious. Almost peed myself a couple times.My girls and I left there still smiling and quoting some memorable jokes. I had such a great time that this WILL be a monthly event with my friends and i.Perfect for a date too, there were a lot of couples there and it was just awesome watching them get awkward and uncomfortable after a sex or date joke.. Overall, awesome-obviously.. the crowd was cool.. a mix of 20-somethings... to granny panties. I highly recommend this place.

"Been here four times now. Saw The Stagebenders for two of the four shows I've been to here. GREAT show! Love this place! It's nice and small, so there is a lot of interaction. Never mean-spirited on the comic's part, always tastefully funny. Definitely make sure you get there on time. They are strict when it comes to the doors closing when the show starts. But it is a live performance; they do the same thing for the ballet at Symphony Hall, out of courtesy to the performers.

"My husband went here last night and had a great time. The mix of comics was quite fun, and the host was very entertaining. As I read before that it is as cold as a meat locker.... I didn't have that experience. My only very small complaint was that the barstools we were sitting in were very very uncomfortable, so I turned it to the side and leaned against the wall. It was a great change of pace adn a great price.

"Hellz ya! I'm a fan.  Hottie and I decided to try out the Comedy Spot on Friday.  We love going to the Improv, but try to avoid Tempe as much as possible. Entry is half the price of the Improv, so I expecting the comics to be half as funny... I was wrong! We were sat in the front row, so of course we got picked on, but I don't think I've laughed that hard in a really long time.  It was a blast.   A couple things to keep in mind: 1.  The place is really small, so buy your tickets in advance or get there a little early. 2. Food is limited to a couple of ""stadium"" style appetizers, so eat first.  3. Two drink minimum, but the prices were pretty reasonable, I think our tab with tip came to $27.  4. Enjoy the comics and don't be afraid to laugh at yourself!

"I really like this place, it is very intimate with very few seats for each show so there is not a bad seat in the house.  Not all the acts are the greatest but it is a great value and it's even great when comics are not doing well (because you are still laughing at them)  The drinks are a little pricy but if not for that I am not even sure how they would make money.  I think for that it is a very fair value for live entertainment, and very great date night place to check out every month or two.  I live so far so it is an evening out for us when we make it out here but well worth the drive.  I saw a Quentin D, (cant remember his last name) but they show was so awesome and he was so funny I nearly pissed myself.  The shows before him were not as good but they weren't bad either.  It also seemed like the show lasted 2 hours in total.  I have to say that this place pretty much rocks and since it is in old town you can go bar hopping right afterward.

"I have had the opportunity to go to the comedy spot on several occasions and have always had a great time.  The comedians are usually funny, but entertaining at a minimum and it's a great venue.  The room itself is pretty small, but creates an atmosphere conducive to laughing.  The prices are really good and like every other comedy club in the world, it's a two drink minimum.Overall, I have never had a bad time there and I am totally going back ASAP!

"The service is amazing! I always have a blast when I go there. The comedy is always relevant and the local flavor and intimate atmosphere makes it a first class experience! If your looking for a great time at an excellent price, this is the place for you!!!

"Went to the The Comedy Spot last night with the wife and had an amazing time. You can't beat the entrance provide and two drink minimum. Plus, they have now added a small but very reasonable menu from the restaurant next door. We had one drunk girl heckling the comedians last night and they handled it perfectly just ripping into her and making the rest of the crowd bust out laughing at her expense. Great place to have an awesome time!!!

"Definitely a fun evening.  Much less expensive than the other clubs in town too.  Comics were funny.

"The Tempe comedy club, which has been featured on NBC's ""Last Comic Standing"" twice, draws some of the biggest comedy headliners from around the U.S. Jerry Seinfeld, David Spade, Jay Mohr and Kathy Griffin have all taken the stage at this hot comedy room. Former ""Saturday Night Live"" comedian sold out all of his performances at the club last weekend! And the Improv recently debuted the Cabaret, an intimate 95-person showroom attached to the club. The room will serve as a stage for up-and-coming comedians, local comedians and one-man shows. Todd Glass from the second season of  ""Last Comic Standing"" sold out the room a few weeks ago.
",1
"This is a world class comedy club.  Every time I go here I end up smashed and laughing my ass off.  2 drink minimum of course, but that is expected.They bring in the creme de la creme of comedy in here.  I saw Joe Rogan and was rolling on the floor almost.  The food is pretty deez, but this is a comedy club and anyone with half a brain would hook up dinner before the show.  Drinks aren't too pricey, and actually cheap in respects to being sold in a venue.  Check out their website and roll in one night when a performer you dig is there, you won't be disappointed.
",1
"Man, I love this place!! It's the perfect place to go for a night out. The comedians are amazing- I can't say that I've seen a bad one in the dozens of times i've been and who doesn't love to laugh The food is a touch overpriced for Tempe, but it's nice to sit and chat for awhile with an appetizer before the comedians come on stage. My favorite place to sit for a date2 person party: in the back of the showroom at the high-top tables. Then you can  have some private conversation - at the tables on the floor, they seat in 4s, so if you go with a date, you will end up sitting with 2 other people- can be good for conversation, but that depends on the people you're next to.

"Jim Breuer.... JIM BREUER!  Holy crap, I'm glad our table was near the exit to the bathroom because I nearly pissed my pants twice from laughter.  Anyway, onto the place itself.This is one of the best comedy clubs I have ever been in.  Tables were crowded as you could expect, but still a great view from anywhere on the floor.  There's no pillars in the way or other obstructions.  We were near the back of the first floor, which was still close enough to easily see Jim's facial expressions.  There is a two item minimum per person, which can be food or drinks.  No one ate any food (we saw the 10pm show) but the drinks came out quickly and beers were ice cold.  This place is also easy to get to and there is a sushi restaurant with $5 sake bombs for happy hour... and I'm not just talking about half a beer and a shot of sake.  These $5 drinks consist of a LARGE Japanese beer and a half pitcher of sake.  You can probably make 3-4 bombs out of this.  I can't remember the name of the place, but it's right downstairs from the club in the same strip mall.

"When I draw a blank for date night, it seems the Improv always ends up working out. LOVE that they have a dinner menushow, and a late night option. I love options!I think the best part of the show is how accessible the comedians are. The second or third time I went, I saw Tom Wilson (who played BIFF in back to the future) and he was great, and signed my trilogy set.  We got to chat before the show and bought his stand-up CD. Another time, we saw Jamie Kennedy (who is MUCH funnier than you'd think) and were able to see him after the show as well.I LOVE the Improv!
",1
"I am starting to conclude that this might just be my most favorite place in the world right now!!! So if I ever am missing and you are wondering where to find me, try this place first! I have been to the Improv so many times and have never really been let down. Almost all the comedians I have seen are extremely talented and hilarious. Let me see if I can name all the ones I have seen: Greg Berehnt (hes just not that into you), Michael Winslow (guy from Police acadamy movies), Gabriel Iglesius, Al Madrigal, Flip Orly (hypnotist), Michael McDonald (MAD Tv, not the singer), Jamie Kennedy, Johnny Sanchez (MAD Tv), and Bob Marley (no not the dead reggae singer). I would have to say the only one that didn't make me laugh as hard was Michael Winslow, there were some slow parts during his show. The rest were terrific though. My favorite is probably a tie between Al Madrigal and Johnny Sanchez. Yes, the no names seem to be the funnier ones. May its cause you go in not expecting much and they turn out to be awesome. Anyways, if you love to laugh and have a good time, this is the place for you. Besides the entertainment, the food and drink is also decent. The hubby and I are a fan of their buffalo wings, zucchini chips, nachos, and cookie dessert. And of course, what goes better together than comedy and booze Their electric lemonade is very tasty along with the simple oldie but goodie pineapple juice and malibu.Keep in mind when ordering tickets that besides the 20 or so $ for the tickets, you will also have to buy 2 items per person which is usually another $40-$50 for a night of fun and laughs. Not a cheap outing, but a really good one for birthdays, anniversaries, etc.Oh and a final tip, if its just you and one other person going, the high top tables in the back are the best to try to request one. Otherwise, you will be sat with complete strangers at some tiny table and are literally arm and arm most of the time....Its up to you but either way, you get the same amount of puny table space when you think about it. Oh and make sure you order your tickets online as they do sell out most of the time...

"Took my lova' on a date here and we had such a good time ! I was impressed and the whole experience was way different from what i anticipated. I Bought our tickets online. We got there early and were able to wait in a lounge they have open before the main show. There is a drink minimum, so if you are looking for a cheap date night then i suggest you look elsewhere. We loved the atmosphere, had good seats, service was great also for the place being packed. You can order food as well, (fruit and cheese platter was awesome!)So glad we came here and I will from now on be checking frequently to see who is performing. Awesome place if you're looking for a little change  from the normal night out. and yes, seats are close together, but if you don't like people then why are you going to watch one make jokes
",1
"This club is what you make it. I've read horrible reviews about the Tempe Improv but our experience is always great! Yeah the servers aren't at your beck & call but they're super busy...gotta be patient! I suggest to having a few drinks before you go so your not so uptight:)

"Who doesn't like a good laugh Always a great time at the Improv. Now we only go when we know the headliner, so we really can't rate the amateur nights. Anyways had a great night here a couple weeks ago. We decided to take my parents who are comedy fanatics like myself and we had an amazing time. First of all it was so easy ordering our tickets online! BTW, since we go there frequently we got an email giving us the tickets for free. Always a nice bonus!Make sure you arrive early so you can get a seat up close. Always fun when you have comedians who like to involve the crowd. We got there early enough to be close, but just outside the comedians reach. We usually don't get food, but we ordered some and were pleasantly surprised at how good it was. Another huge bonus for this place since most comedy clubs we have gone too the food is usually sub par pub grub.All three of the comedians were awesome! The Emcee was very weak, but the comedians did a great job getting people back to that happy place. I have the Improv bookmarked on my phone and computer to keep an eye on the calender of events. We will be back soon and often. Thanks Improv for providing a little laughter in the hot Arizona summers.

"Always have a blast at the Improv.  Its an event whenever you go and watch a show.

"This show is a huge diamond in the rough on the strip in a relatively crappy casino.  We got super cheap tics for $28 at tix4tonight.  The theatre is pretty intimate, although the seating arrangement could have been better since the tables and chairs were way too close to each other.  Luckily there was plenty of space to stretch out as it really wasn't that crowded.  We laughed pretty hard throughout the hour show.  It's been a long time since i've seen the Chicago show, but many of the actors had previously worked in Chicago so the quality of the comedy was very high.  There was quite a bit of interaction w the crowd as well which is something I really love about improv.  This is simply a wonderful and unique show in the midst of everything being bigger than life in Vegas.

"What comes to mind when somebody mentions ""Whose Line Is It Anyway"" Laughter, right Even side splitting comedy, unique scenarios and improvisation. Well, Jesterz is no different. Located in the Papago Plaza at the corner of McDowell and Scottsdale Road, the spot, called Theater 168 due to the location, is tucked into a retail plaza. Blink and you might miss it. Yet, once inside, don't let the decor (or lack thereof) fool you. This isn't about props and paint swatches. This is about comedy, performed on the fly with audience participation. Come prepared to laugh so hard, you almost choke on your gum, like I did. Come prepared to participate, to voice suggestions, topic ideas, emotions.Watch a cohesive team of jesterz weave together comedy - right before your eyes! It's suitable for all ages and is an absolutely perfect date idea. Or, go with friends and family. Bottom line: Just go. You'll leave feeling cheerful and energized. And, if you're like me, you'll be talking about the jokes, the comedy, the laughter, the fun for days and days... so much so that you'll want to go back!Basic info:The Jester'Z perform every Friday and Saturday night at 8:00 & 10pm at Theater 168. Tickets are $12 for the 8pm show and $10 for the 10pm. There is no age restriction and never a drink minimum. (Concessions available at the snack bar)

"I loved this! It was different, it was cheap, and it was good, clean comedy. My favorite kind.

"This is one of my favorite places to take out of town guests.  It never fails that we laugh so hard our sides hurt!  Always fresh, always funny!  Great place for a date night or family night!  Even my teenagers love it!  I never have to worry about offending my guests because their content is family friendly.  To finish off the night, head down the street to ""The Sugar Bowl"" for fresh ice cream!

"I LOL just thinking about some of the cast members and skits that I have seen at Jesterz. The first time I saw Jesterz, I was expecting it to be pretty awkward and honeslty didn't know what to expect. I was blown away how funny it got at times. Good clean funny. We went again soon after the first time but didn't go again for a good 2 years, we went back recently and was kinda worried as the crowd was not as big as past times. Even with a smaller crowd there were tons of LOL moments. Writing about it kinda makes me want to go back.
",1
"Fans of ""Whose Line is It Anyway"" will like Jesterz Improv.  The cast is smart, funny, and welcoming.  It's a treat to see how five very different personality styles combine on stage to assemble stories from audience suggestions.  We took friends on our first visit and had a great time.  You'll definitely have something to talk about after the show.  I appreciate that the ground-rules keep things from veering into the gutter, thereby encouraging creativity.  That doesn't mean it's the best fit for young kids though.  The sweet spot for this ""all ages"" show is probably teens to adults.

"i laughed my ass of the whole time... its a family oriented place soo thier always friendly with thier language and there jokes.. such and amazing improv there truly gifted.. you can aswell do speial requests.. at no extra charge at the prices are worth the laugh. you will have a stomach aching i will deff, recomend yall going. one thing is that you have to make reservations for the day they aslo do events.  make the call and have fun to end the night  as u get home u will still be laughing come back and review!

"this is one of my favorite places to go in the valley! always a blast :)

"This was such a fun evening.Family friendly, so take your kids, take your girlfriend on a date, etc etc.  The owner, Jeff, is always there, always entertaining, and I was leave with a smile on my face.  It takes so much talent to do an improv show, and this is by far the best I've seen.  Can't wait to go again.Check in on Yelp or Facebook and get a free item from there snack bar.

"The improv scene in the Valley is something I really love, so much that I even got into taking classes and eventually became part of the Jester'Z improv troupe in Scottsdale.I went back to Jester'Z to check out my pal, who had a class show. He's only in the first level class, but I was so impressed with how well everyone did and am excited to see the growth at their final class show. They're definitely on the way to becoming great performers and may even make it into the regular troupe.Jester'Z has shows every Friday and Saturday night at 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. Tickets are $12, and that gets you a 1 12 hour show where audience members give suggestions that the troupe takes and turns into short comedic scenes.Jester'Z is extremely consistent with its shows, providing a steady stream of laughter on any given night. Many of the improvisers are also actors in other media, such as film and television, and the troupe is extremely professional.Having been a part of it, I know how hard the actors work and how seriously they take the troupe, and I highly recommend Jester'Z as a fun night out.

"Hahahaha!  I'm still laughing. If you want an evening of family fun, you have to check this place out.  They are hilarious!  I have been 3 times now and each time I leave with my sides hurting.  The best part is that they are CLEAN comedy!  I think it takes a lot more talent to make people laugh without resorting to dirty jokes. They are improv, which means even if they play the same games, you're going to get a completely different show every time.  You're going to have fun.  Trust me!  Plus, there's really no such thing as a ""bad"" seat here.  Even in the back row you're close enough to the stage to be in on the games.  But if you can sit right in the front, I recommend it, because some of the facial expressions from the actors are priceless, especially in those rare instances that one of their team members catches them off-guard. Be sure to add them on Facebook.  Every now and then they'll have last minute specials, plus their shows frequently sell-out, and Facebook is often the quickest way to get that info so you don't have to try going to a sold-out show.Highly recommended, especially if you need a laugh.

"My favorite Vegas Strip comedy club.  The comics are always funny and the price is right compared to the Improv at Harrah's. LA has a more modern look than the outdated Riviera.

"One of the most fun night we have had here in vegas! Went for a friends birthday and ended up only costing us $28 fr me and hubby to drink and get in (Thank you Facebook) Hubby had gottten the all you can drink ... and let me tell you he sure did! $20 all you can drink well drinks he was a happy camper! We had great seats and the comedian was hilarious. I love how he interacted with the audience !! I will definitley go back and maybe get a room this time so i dont have to be dd! :D

"The LA Comedy Club is now located in Planet Hollywood at the Cabo Wabo second floor Being they used to be at this same location when it was Trader Vics I was confused but it is true, Went to Saturday night show, 2 comics and a MC they were very good. the club is on the second floor and has a real great view of the fountains and the strip it is a good venue, Much nicer than the Canyon Club
",1
"A great stand-up show every time!I've been going to L.A. Comedy Club for years now and have never been to a bad show!  Sure sometimes some of the comics aren't as funny as I would like, but the headliner or one of the other two have always made me laugh.  The new venue is at Bally's and is past the Jubilee showroom up the escalators beside the Poker room.  The seats (which a lot of people complained about before when it was at PH) are better than before but still normal padded chairs.  The view isn't as good as it was at PH but it is a better showroom overall and is medium sized yet intimate.  They do a lot of specials as well, from Groupon to locals deals, and their last minute normal pricing is fair as well.  On top of all that, they have an all-u-can-drink special that is usually $25 but can be less if bought with packages.  So the price for an 1.5+ hour show on the strip is A+ awesome!I've met a lot of the comics after the show (not required but I like talking to them), as well as the awesome maitre d (Justin) and even the owner who is often there making sure everyone is having fun.Bottom line:  I really enjoy using the LA comedy club shows as my default date nightnight out or just something fun to do all the time, so check it out if you like comedy!

"The club was great.  There were 5 comics, that were all at different levels of funny. I was expecting only three.   I really liked the headliner and would go see him again.  He was smart and didn't rely on just shocking the audience with a bunch of crap.
",1
"I highly recommend buying tickets to see the stand up comedians at LA Comedy club. My friends and I were laughing until tears were rolling down our faces. The price for the tickets are reasonable and our show was 1.5hours divided between 4 comedians. We will defiantly attend during our next visit to Vegas.

"I loved this show! It was my first time experiencing an ""intimate"" comedy show. At the Palace Station venue we waited forever to get our tickets, but Louie held off from starting until EVERYONE was squeezed in. I can't believe he is still so talented after all of these years. The best part is that you can tell he loved doing the show, and that he loved his audience.
",1
"Although I have attended Louie's show in the past and loved it, the review below is based on my experience when I attended Marty Allen's birthday show.  This review originally appeared on Vegas Posh, the online magazine that my husband and I maintain.Marty Allen is what classic comedy is all about: he's funny without being offensive, charming, has spotless timing, and an arsenal of facial expressions that keep audiences laughing just as much as his jokes do.  When Allen celebrated his 90th birthday with an engagement at the Louie Anderson Theater at Palace Station, he proved to Las Vegas audiences that at 90, he's just as funny as he's ever been.Allen's wife, Karon Kate Blackwell, started off the show by showcasing her vocal talent... the kind that you only find from entertainers who had to rely on their own talent and not on high-tech studio equipment.  Allen appeared before a cheering crowd, opening with a hilarious monologue before doing his first skit, the wine taster from Caesar's Palace, an alcoholic whose wife is so ugly that ""her pictures hang themselves.""Throughout Allen's skits, Blackwell played the straight lady, but even the straight lady couldn't help but laugh at many of his jokes.  The chemistry was undeniable and the two had trouble keeping straight faces throughout many of the skits, including the one that featured Allen as a doctor who had just written the book Everything You've Always Wanted to Know About Sex* *But Were Afraid to Ask Your Children.Between skits, Blackwell sings, dances, and plays piano.  Her performances included a high-energy rendition of ""Proud Mary"" and a deeply moving Beatles medley.Perhaps one of Allen's funniest jokes was the story of an eight year old boy who goes to the store to purchase a box of Tampax.  When the clerk asks if he knows what they're for, he responds ""Not really, but they're for my four year old brother; we saw the commercials and they said if he bought these, he would be able to swim and ride a bike and he can't do either.""  Commenting on modern times, Allen delivered another hilarious line when he joked, ""You know times have changed when a man goes to the drug store and says (loudly) 'I'll take a box of condoms,"" (whispering with his mouth covered) ""... and a pack of cigarettes.""Although Allen's routines are classics and many of his characters originated decades ago, he keeps his act fresh and modern, appealing as much to audiences today as to audiences of the past, without succumbing to the trend of getting cheap laughs through vulgarity.  Audiences were undoubtedly left looking forward to Allen's 91st birthday celebration.

"I love Louie Anderson and I've been really looking forward to seeing him live. This was not a disappointment. The venue is nicely intimate, so you really feel like you're getting a good live show, not just watching something on TV. I've been following his standup for years and I've read most of his books, so I feel like I already know all the people he's joking about, like his parents and siblings. Louie definitely tailors his show for the specific audience, so you'll likely get a different show every time you see him. One of the biggest laughs he got was when he was lamenting that we can't just change the constitution and vote Bill Clinton back in. The whole audience appreciated that one!I loved that he really took time to chat with people who stood in line to buy books, t-shirts, andor DVDs and signed everything. It really makes a difference from a lot of comedians who won't even emerge from the green room except to perform, then sneak out the back.Louie was excellent and if you already like his humour, this show will be a great experience.P.S. -  Drink service was attentive and the opener was great, too, which is also a rarity!

"Love ya Louie !!  Great guy, Great show !!

"Louie Anderson Live is by far the best comedy show we've seen during our trip!  He is a true comedian that anyone can enjoy.  All ages can relate to his true life humor. The theater was perfect in size to make the show intimate and personal.  We purchased general admission tickets and sat directly in front of the stage.  The wait staff was excellent in making sure we had what we needed. My husband and I are still laughing and would recommend this show to anyone!

"My girlfriend and I went on 122714 and Louie's show was amazing. He hasn't lost his touch. His opener Lou Magelowitz is always funny and has a solid jokes. I've gone to multiple comedy shows and this show hands down tops them. Louie even took time to meet everyone, take pictures, and sign stuff after his show! He is still all about the fans. I will definitely come see him perform again. Thank you Lou and Louie for helping make our year end with on a high note.

"I had never heard of this guy Gordie Brown before, but we wanted to see a comedy show while we were in Vegas and it was very reasonably priced at the Tix4Tonight booth, so what the heck!  This was a great show, I laughed a lot and it was definitely worth seeing.

"We first saw Gordie Brown at Celine Dion's concert in San Jose. My boyfriens and I just loved him. He was so funny, charismatic & his voice is great as well.We book eda trip to Vegas end of May to celebrate my b-day and took 2 friends with us to the show.The were laughing so hard. We laughed though the whole show.This guys is going to be big :-)

"Great Impressionist, Great Singer & Really Funny Guy = Gordie BrownFor what he does he is pretty damn good.  I got the chance to see him at the Golden Nugget last night and laughed from the beginning until the end.  He has a whole band and they perform hit songs that he makes fun of ( kinda Weird Al'ish).  He impressionates everyone from Eminem to Jimmy Stewart so all age ranges can appreciate him.His performance isn't just music, he also impersonates Hollywood actors pretty good.Others have given him bad ratings, but I would like to say he is not a hack in anyway.  He is 90 minutes of straight comedy.  The only thing I would say negative was we were in the second row and the music was a tad bit loud, so just be prepared for that.  If you like him as much as I did, at the end give him  the band a standing ovation and you'll get an extra performance.

"I had a long day at work and my head was pounding.  When I got home, my wife tells me that my aunt got us free VIP tickets to see Gordie Brown at the Golden Nugget.  Honestly, I was tired, stressed, I had a headache, and I didn't want to go.  Good thing that my ""fabuloso wife"" convinced me otherwise.  The Gordie Brown show is located in the Golden Nugget - upstairs.  Going up the escalators, it is a bit of a maze.  Once you are in the auditorium, it  is pretty small and cozy... and yes, very comfortable.  Our seats were in the center, 4 rows from the stage.  Fantastic seats!How would I best describe it  Hmm, he is a very eclectic and an entertaining performer.  In a way, he reminds me of a Weird Al Yankovic (for those who lived through the 80s).  He takes old and memorable ""catchy"" songs and rewrites them with his own lyrics.  In addition, it is pretty amazing how he has ""most"" of his wardrobe changes on the stage.  It is pretty funny and extremely entertaining.Overall, the music, lyrics, jokes, and everything was fantastic.  After the show, I felt more relaxed and my headache was gone.  A true test of a show is whether you would return and PAY to see the show again.  My answer is yes. I give this a five star because it was great and it was FREE.  LOL....Enjoy!

"My sister and I were were at Gordie's show this last Tuesday night,  (March 22, 2011), and he was ""terrific"", as usual.  That's why we've been driving in from California once a month (for the last 3 12 years)--just to see Gordie's show.  We first saw him on October 30,2007, at the Venetian, and have been going to his shows ever since!  We'll be there, again, on Thursday, April 14th, in our usual Row C.  Thank you, Gordie, for being such a talented performer.  We'll continue to see your show once a month, as long as we're able.Sue N.

"Extremely Talented.  Impressions, singing, acting, being a nice person... those are insanely harder then I think people give credit for.  And Gordie to me is worth every penny.  When I think of Gordie, I think of appreciation.  He does a little bit of everything, and most of the stuff he does is pretty spot on.  We as show goers turn into critics without ever separating the fact that we have little to no knowledge on most things we crititize.  In this case, it doesn't matter what you know or don't know, he's amazing.  I appreciate he's studying, he's detail, his effort, his appreciation.  He is worth the time and money.

"Great performance for the money!!!At first i was a little nervous....show started 5 mins late, started out ruff but he Sings, dances, tells jokes and does some very funny impersonations! The show kept building until the end and kept my A.D.D busy for a bit!Well worth it!TIP: sit within the first 3 rows near center or u will miss the face expressions which are hilarious!

His timing, his voice, his song selection and his entertainment value are off the chart!!! How much do I pay for this guy I got free tickets but I would absolutely pay $100 to see him perform.

"SOOO freakin' funny! I'm a fan now!  I literally laughed so hard, whew, I needed those laughs!  Gordie has such a cute charm.Can't wait to go back! :)

"I think that I can safely say that there were few things that my father and I agreed on....Rita Rudner happens to be one of them.  She is hilarious and her show is just terrific.  She had me in stitches from start to end.  My husband likes his humor a little ""raunchier"" but RR is right up my alley.  She manages to be whitty and smart without being crass or swearing or the like.  She is just a class act.  Impeccable timing...funny stories about her English husband and her dog just makes it al the more personal and funny.  I love her wardrobe.  She is just the best best best!!!!
",1
"We loved it!  Rita did a great show and we couldn't have laughed more!  I had a interesting party with me, my 11 year old step daughter who has never watched a comedy show and my mother in law that lost her husband less than a month earlier.  I was so happy to see both of them laugh so hard and for my mother in law, it was the best seeing her smile and laugh again.  Rita was charming and came across like the kind of gal you'd love to have over to the house and we didn't have to worry about the foul language and inappropriate material for my step daughter - with the exception of the one time ""A-hole"" which had us all in stitches.  Very relatable material - we LOVED it.

"To quote another blog ""I ate a lot of red meat this week."" I have to blame (in a good way) Tom Friday's for the switch in my diet.  The meats offered at this small neighborhood market are fresh and quality. The price is affordable. . .for example this week my fiance and I dined on an amazing seasoned brisket for less then $5.00 each. The seasoning was perfect, the cooking instructions they provided when I asked worked without a single hitch, and the beef was tender and juicy even when well-done (which is how I like my meat cooked).They advertise their fresh Italian sausage (hot and sweet) - which is stocked new each Friday.  Also worth while is their ground beef (we easily go through a couple of lbs of ground beef a week between the two of us).  A slab of ribs will cook up tasty and tender on the grill, without needing to boil or marinade for hours. I have yet to try many of their other offerings - but I am sure I will at some point!Also check out the hot dog and hamburger buns - they are fresh and delicious!!The service is also friendly and helpful.  If I could adjust anything it would be the hours - they close at 5:00 each day and are not open on Sundays.  Thus, you have to make that effort to get their on Saturdays if you are not right near by in the neighborhood!

"I can't believe this place only has one review.  But I can believe that the one review is a 5 star rating.  I also believe that Tom Friday's defines the term ""Meat shop.""  I've never been disappointed.  Excellent meats, good quality at reasonable prices and great customer service.  I've had several of their offerings including the pre-made hoagies (yummy) and homemade kielbasa (perfectly seasoned).  Their ground meat makes the most delectible burgers.  The huge cuts of steak I've had were always the freshest.  And I'm always a fan of the popular butter steaks.  Basically my review is this: if you like good meat, support your local meat shop and stop by Tom Friday's Market.  You'll be glad you treated yourself.

"This is a gem in Pittsburgh.  The owner, Tom, and the workers will remember your name.  Its just like being in a small town.  Fresh meat and friendly people.  The meat is the best I have found in the city and is affordable too.  The best steaks I have ever eaten have been purchased from there and cooked in my own kitchen!  They are also very knowledgeable.  They can answer any question you have about what cut of meat to choose or how to cook something.  They're also more than happy to share tried and true recipes, which have always worked out for me.

"what can i say that EVERYONE in the area doesn't already know  i've been going there over 30 years...the staff are always friendly..their deli meats and cheeses are good quality and well below chain store prices...and the specials are always a fabulous value!  i have never been in the store when its not busy busy busy...that just shows how much people love this store!

"Our go to butcher shop.  High quality, fresh meat at fair prices. Friendly service. Convenient for us, but worth the drive for others.  Support your local meat shop!

"Saved the day!  We had custom ordered a ham from another place and they totally ignored the order.  We had to return the sad excuse for a ham and began the search.  Found this place and saw the 5 stars.  Made a call and was transferred to the meat section.  Bernie took 3 seconds to tell me she had what I wanted and to come on in.When I got there I saw why it had 5 stars.  Their meat section was amazing!  If I lived here I would take them up on their freezer meat offers.  What a deal!As I was checking out there was a final thing that made me know we had come to the right place.  The local fire crew was coming in to grab their meats.  Nuff said.Eat well!

"Hooray for the Vikings.  Sure they might have looted and pillaged their way across Europe and spawned plenty of bad death metal bands, but in the grand scheme of things that's pretty minor. Why Because without a little genetic mutation spawned in Scandinavia that allows adults to continue consuming dairy all their lives, I'd have to avoid the amazing cheese section that Penn Mac has and would be stuck eating some funky soy based cheese or *gasp* having to do without and that would be a sad day indeed.With enough cheeses to make Wallace & Gromit happy, you are bound to find what you are looking at Penn Mac.   And if you don't know what you are looking for the cheesemongers are great in helping you find your whey.If that was all Penn Mac had it would still be a required shopping destination, but they have so much more.  Their deli is just as amazing with the best Prosciutto di Parma you can buy.  And If you can't find the olive oil or other Italian ingredients you need here then the only place you are going to find them is back in Italy.

"i need you in los angeles. boo hoo. wah. sob. appreciate this place, pittsburghers. it rocks!!!the cheese is of amazing quality and freshness. What fucking variety.And there are a million other tasty things under this roof. you can't find a place like this easily, trust me, i have tried!
",1
"Off the Hook, amazing selection of cheese!!Go here!
",1
"I agree, this is a wonderful place to buy cheese.  Anywhere else in Pittsburgh (and I do mean TJ's and Whole Foods, as well as Giant Eagle) your cheese is likely to taste like the plastic it is wrapped in.  At Penn Mac, it's not only the best in town, it's beyond excellent.  In price, freshness, quality, selection.  You can buy half pounds, despite what the sign says.  I always did.  I also think the nuts are a great deal,  and the spices.  Worth the trek from whatever neighborhood you live in, or from your downtown workplace.  If you have a car, they do have (limited) parking in back.  And some of the nicest flowers in Pittsburgh are sold out front, too!  Holiday seasons and weekends this place is a bit nuts, but I went regularly, year-round, maybe every 2 weeks and totally relied on this place.Foodies visiting Pittsburgh, especially if you're staying in the Convention Center area, should definitely check out ""the Strip"" for shopping and snacks.
",1
"Penn Mac deserves more than 5 stars!This place is the best italian food store I've seen anywhere in the US.  The selection and quality of their cheeses, meats, olives, pastas, oils, sauces, etc is just incredible.  The prices are also really good - any other store with a big cheese selection will charge a ton more.I used to shop here at least once a week and since I've moved away from Pittsburgh, this is the store I miss the most.  I now live in Chicago and even here there is nothing like it.  I still frequently buy their stuff online through their website....Thank God for the internet.Favorite items include: Calabrese Olives, House Italian Olive Oil, Istara Cheese, Mortadella wPistaccio, Ciabatta Bread
",1
"So much to oggle, so much to buy! I think I'm in love. I had too much fun at this place! Great selections of cheese, meat, pasta, etc... makes me want to buy and play. They also had the biggest bottles of olive oil I'd ever seen... so, you know, you can buy just that exact quantity of oil that you need. I must go back.
",1
"dudes and dudettes, this place is amazing. they've got cheese, pepperoni and prosciutto coming out their ears. fresh pasta, homemade pasta sauce and olive oil from the barrel for the taking. they've got frozen dough, pepperoni slices and shredded cheese all next together if you want to bake your own pizzas. when they're not busy go to the deli and find the perfect compliment to whatever wine you've been needing an excuse to drink. the people that work there are the nicest folk that clearly love their jobs. most of them love that i don't know the first thing about anything italian because it gives them a chance to share what it is they specialize in. goods are cheap, fresh and of the highest quality. i hope i'm able to find something similar when i move soon. one of the top 10 reasons i've enjoyed my time in pittsburgh.

"""Hey, darling, you talkin' to your boyfriend""  the deli counter man recently teased me as I waited in line talking on my cell phone.  Oh the deli men - they're hilarious.  I'd even say, their worth the trip out to the store, but you might want to know more about the food, glorious food. I shop at the Macaroni Company weekly.  They're great.  From the deli men who hand you samples of meats and cheeses while you wait, to the great selection of bulk foods, to fine selection of meats to the Italian cheeses, to the fill-a-bottle- olive oil station to the fresh pasta to the bulk spices section to the moon and the sun and the earth and Jupiter, this place is lovely.  (Or loverly if your Eliza Dolittle).  The place tends to be packed like a tin of touch-a-philic sardines on the weekends, and I think many people are tourists, but that doesn't stop it from being great. And, that was a long sentence, but not as long as those of some really antiquated authors I've read.In any case, the Macaroni Company is a little slice of Italy mixed with Pittsburgherness and fun.
",1
"I will never buy any type of Italian sausage at Giant Eagle again because now i know what real sausage tastes like.  And, the deli counter guy at Giant Eagle doesn't inappropriately and amusingly call me ""babe"" every five seconds like the ones at Penn Mac do.   Ordering ""hot italian sausage"" from a deli guy that calls you ""babe"" is as amusing as Sunday morning can get.   :-)    I'll keep coming here for fresh meats and cheeses as long as I live in Pittsburgh.

"I walked into Penn Macaroni Co knowing I knew absolutely nothing about cured meats and cheeses.  I've always been intimidated by specialty shops bc there are always giant lines with people who look impatient and want to just grab what they need and head out.  I decided to swallow up my fear and head inside with the intention of walking out knowing more than when I walked in.I headed to the cured meats section in the deli room and kinda just stood back staring at all the beautiful meats.  When one of the deli guys was free and asked me if I needed help, I flat out told him ""I know nothing about anything in this room.  But I want to learn.""  And he was like ""I got just what you need"" and brought out some samples for me.  He went on to explain them to me and what kind of cheeses to pair with stuff.  After I picked out my meat, I was heading over to the cheese counter when he kinda called me out and was like ""I'm not done with you yet!"" and handed me butcher paper with even more cured meats and cheeses to try out.  He also told me I have to feed my friend more bc she looked too skinny, =P.I love going into a store where I get individualized attention by someone who actually cares about what he or she is doing and is passionate about his or her job.  It just makes you walk out with a smile on your face.I plan on heading back every other week to get a new pairing of meats and cheeses and hopefully one day my palate will be super sophisticated, haha

"MHoly crap this place is amazing!  Best meat selection in Madison. Tons of brats! Awesome service too!Weekly he has a 10 for $10 burger special, which is amazing, and our first time, we only bought 2 burgers (yummy pizza ones) and he gave us 2 buns!  Today we got jalapenocheddar burgers, brat patties, and chipotle burgers, plus 4 Hawaiian brats (they have pineapple in them)! All of that was $16!We also put an order in for an upcoming special they are having--12 sirloins for $20 and 10 lbs of jalapenocheddar brats for $3.99lb.I am so glad that my man and I found this gem... If you love both traditional cuts and innovative hybrids, check out Jims!Ps, Jim is a super nice guy too, who loves his business and does it well!

"Awesome local meat market. Nice selection, incredibly friendly staff & great deals!

"Great selection of meat and sausage... I dropped in on a lark and they had unlimited Skirt Steak... which I couldn't find anywhere else in Madison (totally weird, coming from chicago).  Great quality skirt, required a bit of additional trimming, but that's normal...will visit Jim again and again

"I love these guys!! They always have great recommendations and good quality food. They are my go-to meat market, even now that I live outside of Madison. They are super friendly, too, and helped me carry stuff out to my car when I was with my baby. GREAT STORE!!

"Friendly neighborhood meat market. Everyday prices are competitive; weekly specials are spectacular--beats supermarket prices for much better quality meat. Best item: the Sheboygan brats. These are absolutely the best brats I've ever had, whether in Wisconsin or in Germany. Other varieties are very good, too.The staff, moreover, is both friendly and knowledgeable. They can do practically any custom order. They get to know their customers and treat regulars like family.

"Love this place and the people that run it. They're just an old school neighborhood meat market.  Burgundy steaks are the best. Great deals ALWAYS!!!

"Jim's completely rocks! John (part owner & tall, friendly guy behind the counter) will take time to talk with you about your wants & needs, and will special order anything you wish. I say this because he did it for me many times over the years that I lived walking distance from the store. Their fresh, Amish turkeys are the best you can get for Thanksgiving. You do need to order those in advance, however. If you don't see what you're looking for in the display case, just ask. He would custom cut a chunk of center sirloin for me - he always had a primal in stock, not frozen. He would let me hang out in the lobby and talk meat on Saturday mornings, between customers. I wanted to help out behind the counter, just to learn from the team, but they hire young people to work the counter, and I couldn't take a job as a hobby that someone else needed to get thru school, etc. Long story short - If you likelove meat, but can't tell a ribeye from a strip, this is the place to go. They will help you make a decision, and how to treat the meat if need be. Remember - the only stupid question is the one that never gets asked. You needn't worry that you will be looked down upon if you ask a novice grilling question. This is not a pretentious boutique. It's a friendly, helpful business that truly values your business, and they will help you make some killer meat!

"If you love steak, you'll love Ken's.  I take that back.  If you love meat PERIOD, you'll love Ken's.  They have the best steaks ever, and the chicken breasts are huge.  Their brats are really good, as are the rubbed pork grillers.They have a variety of other picnic staples like potato salads and macaroni salads and some produce.  Then, add to all that, they have a convenience store attached so you can buy some pop or beer or whatever.My personal favorites are the burgandy pepper steaks.  It just doesn't get any better.

"Only been there once and been wanting go back again soon. We used to go to that side of town once a month and I would wonder about this place with my husband's name. So one day, stopped there to see if they have anything quick to eat. Fresh sandwiches were great....made the way we wanted. The place was clean and very friendly. Too bad,found it after I no longer live on that side of town.

"Burgundy Pepper Steak. Get one of these and you will understand why 5 stars isn't nearly enough! So good!
",1
"Ken's is great. We rarely have ever got bad meat here - and we've been to Ken's at least once a week for almost 15 years. Virtually all the steaks are great. People really like the Burgundy Pepper Steaks. The Rib Eyes and NY Strips are my favorites. The Sheboygan brats are fabulous. The ribs are great too - nice and meaty. When my family does burgers we always get their sirloin burgers. Really tasty.The staff is often younger people - but they are very nice and well trained. The only downside would be is that it's pretty expensive - especially the non-meat products. I only get the non-meat things if I really need something and want to save a trip to the regular grocery store (but this is typical of mini-mart type places).Beware - on nice days they will go through some things early. Don't wait until the last minute. They do let you call and make orders, which is nice if you want to guarantee something will be in.A wonderful place. Highly recommend.

"The best meat market in Madison. It has great gresh chicken brests. Get the burgundy marinaded steak. Check it out.

"We moved into our Monona neighborhood over a year ago and ever since that day, Ken's has been a mealtimeneighborhood staple.  It's so easy to pop in and grab something delicious to throw on the grill.  They also offer a decent assortment of deli salads, pickled veggies, pies, wine, and other need-to-haves so you don't have to waste time running to large grocery stores for last-minute items.  New to Ken's  Try one of their delicious pinwheels, or my favorite--burgundy and black pepper steak.
",1
"I stop here for the meats and fresh made sandwiches. It is a convenience store with a very nice meat case. There are reviews on here complaining that they don't have an actual butcher shop. There are not that many around anymore so deal with it or butcher your own. Burgundy Pepper Steaks are marvelous. I tried to marinate my own, but have not been able to match these. Reasonable prices.
",1
"Every single thing is delicious here. I go here for my monthly freshly made deli sandwich for lunch. I almost always get the honey ham and Swiss on a croissant with green leaf lettuce, fresh, red, thinly sliced tomatoes and perfect mayo. Their pre-made salads and sandwiches are creative and fresh too. Great breads, fresh cheeses, oh and Babcock Hall ice cream!!
",1
"I first went looking for a good butcher shop after getting sick of the poor quality meat found in grocery stores. Every piece of meat I've had here has been delicious. They also have fish and some interesting game meats, though I haven't tried either.You can also get some lunch food here. If you are lucky enough to go by when they are smoking some meat in their outdoor pig-shaped grill, the smell is intoxicating. Their deli selection is small, but I find they have everything I need. The people here are very friendly, and you'll notice the same people working most of the time. It has a very nice local feel that beats going to a grocery chain hands down.

"Ye Old Time Meat and Deli Shoppe is one of the only places in champaign that I have no reservations about giving 5 stars.  It is SPOTLESSLY clean inside, and full of tip top meats!  The staff have always been nice and helpful when I've been there, and I'm pretty sure it's the only place in CU that has rack of lamb.

"Why did it take us so long to discover Old Time It is amazing, I will never buy meat or fish at the supermarket again! I particularly like the knowledgeable staff, the smell of BBQ, and the extensive range of high quality products they sell. The best beef I have seen outside of Texas and New Zealand!

"i don't even know where to start with old time meat and deli because i have too many good things to say about it. absolutely delicious cuts of all sorts of meat check.employees who are helpful and actually know everything about their products check.the best yeast rolls i have ever found anywhere check.fresh bones for my dogs to chomp on check.and the list goes on.....this is the only place in all of central illinois i will buy meat from. they get their meats and rolls (not deli meat) from local amish communities, and it is obvious that they take great pride in all that they sell.  every cut of meat i have had from here, whether it be ground chuck, a pork chop, spiral ham or rib-roast, has been absolutely amazing. and their bacon is to die for. the best bacon i have ever had. i'm drooling just thinking about it. yum.if you think you've been buying great cuts of meat from a grocery store in the c-u area, i will tell you you haven't and that it's time you visit old time and see what a quality piece of meat tastes like. you will never be disappointed.

"This place is so awesome!  Very fresh cuts of meat, great customer service, knowledgeable employees, what more can you ask for!  They are always willing to go the extra mile here.  On one occasion, I bought meat for a stir fry, and the employee offered to cut up the meat for me without me even having to ask.  Another time I was looking for salmon fillets and the fish had just gotten there and one of the employees cut me a fillet.  I highly recommend this place!
",1
"I am thrilled to death that this place exists.  They have a wide variety of meat and cheese products, most (all) of which is produced locally.  Furthermore, said meat and cheese products are *delicious*.  Frankly, I think for what you're getting, their prices are very fair.  I went in and bought a package of thick-cut bacon (which was heavenly, by the way), a very large cut of choice filet, a pound of virginia ham, a half pound of provolone, and some beef sticks, and only emerged about $30 lighter.  That's a pretty great deal.

"This place is THE BEST place to get meat in the C-U area.  Their staff is friendly and knowledable; it's just the kind of place you'd think would be packed in a place like Champaign.  Not only do they have a good selection of beef and pork, but you can pick up side dishes (and Beef House Rolls, win!).  They'll also cut you something special if you ask.  Definitely stop off on your way home via Neil Street and you won't be disappointed!

"This is a wonderful butchershop. Deli selections limited to standards of ham, turkey, chicken with good selection of cheeses. Prices reasonable considering the quality.

"Knowledgeable, friendly staff.  Sirloin patties and the twice baked potatoes are my go-to choices here.  Will make a special trip for them.  Good stuff.

"The prime cuts from here are so good, both my wife and I have become too ""spoiled"" to enjoy several of our former favorite steakhouses - preferring to stay home and cook these ourselves.The staff are extremely knowledgeable and are willing to help with advice, getting a fresh cut, trimming to order, or anything else that might conceivably make you happier with them as a butcher.I can not recommend this shop enough.

"Loves me some Stanley's!  I've been going to Stanley's for years and years and thank goodness some things never change.  I don't have any friends who have eaten Stanley's subs and don't love them (if they didn't I'd probably end the friendship.)I love the ladies behind the counter who spent plenty of time in the old-country, love the meat hanging everywhere, love the imported grocery items - even love the small...everything (parking lot, building, tables, etc.)Quality meat means great sandwiches!  We swear that they put an addictive chemical on it that makes you crave it fortnightly.Even if you know of Stanley's for their sandwiches - do yourself a favor sometime and order a plate of pierogies (they'll even heat them up for you if you ask).  They're dynamite.
",1
"Stanley's, yum!!!!.  When I got married many many years ago, Stanley's catered food for my reception.  There were sausages, stuffed cabbage, sauerkraut, pierogies.  OMG!  My Hungarian grandmother would have been very pleased.  I just wish she could have been there.  Anyway, just wanted to say that everyone raved about the food and we had lots of leftovers, ordered extra on purpose.  Since grandma was no longer with us, she did all the amazing cooking of these wonderful foods, we savored each and every bite.
",1
"There is so much goodness in this place I don't even know where to begin. I've been going here ever since i was a little girl, A few times a month my mom or grandma would stop in and get the smoked butt, perogi's, polish sausage, blood sausage, bratwurst,  hot italian sausage, liverwurst, bacon, or whatever was recommended to us at the time by the ladies behind the counter.  I have to admit as a child I was pretty unnerved by the ladies behind the counter but after 25+ years of going here, they are very sweet and wonderful ladies. Many times I have asked for suggestions and the have always came through for me. On my last trip I told them I am having a BBQ this weekend and what smoked sausage would go best as a snack.  Their question ""are you serving beer"", and yes I was! The next question ""you like spicy"" and yes i do.  She went over to the side wall and pulled two giant red links off the rack and said with a smile ""This...will be good."" (when I got home I tried a little and It was good!)I can see where people can say the ladies behind the counter are intimidating but they really are wonderful.  I have stopped in for a sandwich a time or two in the afternoon and had great conversations with them when I was the only one in the store and it was slow.  They have even offered me a tour once.This is a place ran by hard working immigrants that have an amazing product. Every time I am in the area a make a point of stopping in and getting the smoked butt (the ""butt"" is actually the shoulder cut on a pig bot the actual butt). Its excellent sliced thin on a sandwich.You don't find sausage shops like this anymore.  My grandma grew up in Wisconsin and she said this place reminded her of the polish deli's she went to back in the 50's.  Authentic and yummy.

"The thing I saw another reviewer hate aobut this place I love, which is you walk in the door and it feels like you have entered into Eastern Europe. The backwall is lined with all sorts of smoked pork products, from chunks of smoked bacon, to ham, to what seems like a never ending display of different types of sausages and yes, the women providing the service are not all that smiley but come on, you get an authentic experience with people you know their smoked meats, and boy are those good!I picked up a chunk of smoked bacan that they slice for you and the smoked pork butt is just wow! I went home and chopped some up and sauteed it with some sliced fennel bulb and lentils and it was like wow, so good, both smoky and salty. I also picked up some sort of dried sausage stick and though it is bad for you, it is so good - a great addition to a nice glass of red wine, some cheese, and some good french bread.By the way, if you live in Tempe and go to the farmer's market on Saturday morning it is on your way home, just take 7th street to McDowell and take a right and it is right around 21st Street and McDowell.So, when you go in the store and the Eastern European women don't smile at you just remember, you walk in that store and you are in their culture, not yours, so enjoy the experience and buy some sausage! :-)

"Old Skool European at it's best! . .  Sausages hanging behind the counter to dry and age and the smell of the place made me want to lick the walls! The ladies behind the counter are a testimonial to how authentic Stanley's Homemade Sausage is completely the real deal! There are many european grocery items avalable to purchase as well. The sandwiches are yummy and fresh on bread that seams as if it just came out of the oven. (Even though I don't think they bake anything there) The Meat is what it's all about ! Reminds me of Parma the Polish area in Cleveland and the Polish American Festivals . . . without the crowds!

"Almost seems a waste of time to review this place.  If you're not already a fan, my 5 star isn't going to change your mind.But Wow!  Our two friends said the best brats (8) they ever ate.  And our smoked sausage sandwichs (18 & 20) were fabulous.Sorry, guys, the lady who took our order (on a Saturday noon) was reasonably happy and the gal delivering from the kitchen was very smiley and friendly.  Must have been our Irish charm.  So next time you go, don't pretend to be Polish, tell 'em you're Irish!

"Smells great, feels very old-world when you walk.  The lady behind the counter was so calm and unruffled as the place steadily filled up while my Mother placed her order for a month's worth of meat!  Asked her to recommend a sausage to go with cheesecrackers -Krakaw is a about the size of my thumb and so flavorful and rich tasting - yummy.   I chose the Polish sausage and Hungarian sausage to take home for Master Griller to have his way with them - will have to update my review after the big event!They offer homemade sandwiches there too - we got something loaded with a variety of lunchmeats on this soft, almost ""roll"" bread.  Reasonably priced and so fresh n tasty.  However, when I made a smart crack about ""what kind of knucklehead would order the Vegetarian Sub that was on the menu"" I couldn't even get a little snicker out of the counter lady, she is old school & old world.  I LOVE IT!  Go there, check out the website First so you know what you might want to order, counter lady don't play and she don't mark those items all wrapped up in white paper so pay attention and do it when you get home! Support Your Local Businesses or you will be left in a corporate clone world!

"Bring your wallet or if you have little self control it maybe better to just bring some cash and leave the plastic and pay check at home. The smell of the meats curing on the racks when you walk in to the front deli will transport you to meat Valhalla. This is what a deli is supposed to be. All their meats here are delicious. If the lady behind the counter is mean to you, you probably deserve it. If your a first timer just order the European Sub. All they're cold cut

"Great sausage-maker in central Phoenix. Try a few of these instead of what you get at Trader Joe's (which are also good) and you'll never go back. You can get anything here from from andouille to chicken cranberry. The staff are helpful, welcoming, and thorough.

My favorite is the homemade slab bacon because it doesn't taste as salty as bacon you can buy elsewhere.  They will also slice the bacon to your desired thickness.  What could be better  I like my bacon sliced nice and thick (setting number 6) so that the pieces cook up lovely and crisp.  I top my homemade Curried Deviled Eggs with pieces of Schreiner's crispy bacon.  You can also buy the slab bacon if you have a recipe that calls for you to make your own lardons.Schreiner's offers over 60 varieties of homemade sausages.  They feature everything from Bratwurst, Italian and Polish sausages to the hard-to-find items such as: Andouille and Tasso (Cajun); Linguisa (Portuguese); Bangers (English); Chorico (Spanish); Chorizo (Mexican); and Cheese Sausage.They also have homemade lunch meats, hickory-smoked hams and more.Don't overlook their wall of pickles and pantry items.  The Frisch-Gurken baby pickles that the BF and I picked up here are the cutest addition to a relish tray.The pig is a wonderful, magical animal and Schreiner's Fine Sausage is a wonderful, magical place.

"Oh my goodness!  My husband and I have driven by here many many times but never thought it was open.  Finally, at the Local First festival we were treated to samples of their oh-so-fine sausage.  You can taste the freshness in the incredible product that they put out.  We decided to finally stop by because we were making homemade pizza for our annual Christmas Eve tradition and this time, my husband and I were in charge, and we wanted to make it special.  We came in to buy Italian sausage and pepperoni, but we were hard pressed not to leave with more.  They sliced the pepperoni nice and thin exactly the way we wanted it and gave us a big giant string of weiners, which I found hysterical.  We opened the wrapped up pepperoni in the car and we had a really difficult time restraining ourselves from eating the whole thing.Bottom line, if you want the freshest most delicious locally made sausages and other stuff like that you HAVE to go to Schreiners.

"I stopped in for lunch and walked out with 2 pounds of lovely charcuterie products. Their shelves are stacked full of various sausages, smoked pork chops, head cheese and more. Their $5 Brown bag lunch was a steal as well. Your choice of one of 6 different sausages served hot on a bun, with your choice of toppings. All that with a soda and bag of chips. Very nice. I purchased a pound of smoked bratwurst and a pound of bockwurst. The smoked brats were very tasty with a light smoke flavor. Reminiscent of the Hillshire Farms smoked kielbasa my mom used to buy. The bockwurst, let me tell you, were delicious. A creamy mixture of pork, herbs and spices all encased in natural hog casings. When I closed my eyes, I could imagine my childhood growing up in Germany. They were that damn good. I will definitely be back. And will definitely walk out with a few more pounds of sausage.

"I cannot believe that I haven't reviewed this place yet. It's incredible, really. An incredible amount of pork products, from all natural casing hot dogs, to different wursts, to the most amazing sausages, and tons of products like capicolla, head cheese, bologna...it's all good.This past weekend, I picked up the Hot Italians, Sweet Italians, Apple, Jalapeno Cheddar Dogs, Beer Hots, and their Cajun Boudins.Obviously, I love my pork (urge to make sausage innuendo jokes rising...). All of the sausages were amazing. Juicy, tender, with crisp skins. The hot italians were actually spicy, which is amazing, most ""hot"" italians aren't. The jalapeno cheddar dog was gooey and spicy, and the beer hots were spicy with just a hint of lager to them.I've had the Cajun Boudins, but I haven't been able to get into my new ones, but to be honest, they're amazing. Mixing pork and rice in a sausage is an awesome idea.In their store, they have samples. The head cheese is glorious, despite the name of ""head cheese"", trust me, it's incredible...Very cheap prices and friendly staff (even though I would honestly expect a huge italian guy, yet I am greeted by two awesome women) help round it out, and keeps Schreiner's at the absolute top of my list.

"So I've been here like a kazillion times, but never thought about posting a review for it. This place is sausage heaven! (crack all the jokes you want haha)  I moved back to Cen. Pho about a year and a half ago and had always wanted to check this place out, but never did. I was instantly hooked, and have been a loyal customer ever since.  They have tons of different types of sausages and dogs. Most come smoked or fresh. I'm a huge fan of their smoked Linguisa and their' Chorico. They also have these odds and ends mixed sausage-brat-hotdog skewers for like 2 bucks a pound,and I'm a real sucker for those! The prices are awesome, you can get out under $20 with a great mix of sausages and brats for the grill. Make this your Go-to spot for grilling this summer and trust me, you won't be disappointed!

"You can't beat Shriner's meat!! After a visit to Short Leash dogs (they serve Shriner's meats) I had to go to the source. I am of German decent and grew up with some dang good weenies. They have to be in a natural casing with a great flavor and snap. We got two pounds and they are marvelous, just pick them up and dip in some good mustard and you are set. We also bought some traditional brats. These were the best I have ever had. The flavor was outstanding. Last but not least we got some of the bacon. They will slice it to your preferred thickness and boy is it good! The prices here are fair especially considering the quality you receive. Go get some! (Wieners that is) :)

"You like your meat long, smoked, and spicy They got that. Short and thick  with an au naturel casing They got that too. Thin, floppy and tasting of meatloaf Hey, whatever gets your rocks off. The snausages here are crazy amazing and they have just about any pork related product your little heart can dream up, ground to an appetizing taste and texture with just the right amount of spice. The prices are also more than fair compared to other meat markets around town. Word to the wise, Schreiner's is a small mom and pop and they only take cash, check (crazy, right), or debit cards. No credit will be extended to your broke ass. And if you want to use your debit card you have to gather up at least ten bucks worth of meat in your hot little paws before they'll run the card. Don't worry, it's more than easy to do. The people that work here are very knowledgeable and if you tell them what you like and why, they'll recommend all sorts of stuff. They have an intimate knowledge of the meat they sling. So stop on buy, shoot the shit, and they'll slip you some mighty fine sausage.

"I'm repeatedly astounded at how many people in this city who claim to be in the ""culinary know"" have no idea what Schreiner's is. Besides the tremendous brown bag lunch special, which consists of any dog or sausage with chips and a soda for $5, Schreiner's is a great place to buy loaf meat, weiners, and sausages. Many chefs in town swear by their products and it's for good reason, they are some of the best around. I made some home made Sonoran Hot Dogs last night using Schreiner's hot dogs, and it was one of the best dogs I'd ever had.

"Ok. This place is THE BEST place to get sausages in Phoenix PERIOD! The breakfast sausage could very well best the best ever. I go here regularly and have had so many of thier sausages, they have all been great. I do not even buy supermarket sausage anymore after finding this place, not even in the same ball park. Top notch.

"We were able to get a great cut of brisket here, just over 3lbs which is just what we wanted.  It may look scarce when you walk in but most of the meat is kept in the back so just ask.  In addition to pastrami brisket you can get corned beef brisket, chicken, and assorted other deli meats.  They have have a grocer section where we were able to pick up challah rolls (mmm...challah french toast anyone), matzo meal for latkes and my husband's favorite pickles- Ba Tampte.  There are also lots of other selections ranging from candy to cous cous to egg flakes and cereals.  They have a pizza place next door (which may have deli offerings as well...) called King Solomon's but Segals itself is just a pure butcher and grocer.  Having grown up with kosher pizza we opted to not grab a slice because to be honest, kosher pizza isn't all that good.

"The first time I stepped into the store, I was hit by a wave of wonderful aromas that reminded me of growing up in Germany. The lunch meats, smoked hams, brats, blutwurst, etc are from authentic German recipes, and one can even get a real schnitzel here. The ladies behind the counter treat you like you would get treated in a store in Germany, and the store also offers a selection of foods imported from Germany. Jams, coffee, breads, dairy products like butter and quark, cookies, candy, canned goods, cooking and baking mixes.... If you have German recipes and haven't made them because you can't find the right ingredients, or if you just like good food, please pay this store a visit. You will be pleasantly surprised. But bring cash! No credit cards accepted. Or you could go next door to the Black Forest Mill to have your German meal prepared for you along with a German beer....

"This place is a wonder.  All kinds of sausages, and meats.  I'm a real push over for smoked meat.  I especially like their lachs schinken which is smoked ham cut very thin.  Making soup  Try it with a smoked pork haxen.  Another favorite is their fleisch salat.  But beware, the fleisch salat is put into a container without weighing so the price of each container may not be what you think it will be.....close but not exact.Great place and like all German butcher shops, it's closed on Monday.

"The German Sausage company is the closest thing we have to a big city charcuterie in Phoenix.  Our family has been enjoying their homemade ham, lyoner, bratwurst and smoked meats for 30 years.  Their prices are so much more reasonable than the grocery store deli counters and their products are always very fresh.  Walking through the door will immediately transport you to Europe!  Don't miss this Valley gem  - cash or check only just like the olden days!

"So glad we found this place! Everything is fresh and tastes just like we get when we are in Germany! Walked out with some fresh warm pretzels last week too!  This is our number one place for authentic German meat.

"Best German sausages that I ever had.  They taste the same as those that I had when I traveled to Germany.  And the best thing is that they will vacuum packed them so they can last for a month and taste just as fresh as long as you don't break the package.

"I was raised in Germany... This place is as close to ""home"" as it gets! Try everything. The service is gracious.... Bring CASH!!! If the made cake that day, don't ask what it is, just buy it, it's going to be delicious!!!! Leberwurst (liver wurst) is fantastic, best I have had in the us! Every sausage tastes authentic and fresh! You won't regret it...

"This place is awesome. We can't eat regular store bought brats anymore. Their potato salad is to die for as well.When you walk in you get a strong smell of....well something awesome and smokey and realize behind the register there are smoked something or others hanging right there in front of you. To the left are some grocery items as well as spietzle (sp) and some other items. To the right is the deli counter that holds TONS of meats and other goodies as well as their brats. They have two kinds, from what I have seen, course ground and find ground I believe. I am not sure of the difference since we usually only get the fine ground white ones.They make limited portions of everything since its all fresh, so get there fast for the potato salad.This is our go to for grilling out and its always delicious.

"This is a true phoenix treasure! The two sisters are very helpful, pleasant and business-like. Sometimes when they have meat just out of the smoker, they will offer a sample, or they'll toss in an end chub (wrapped) into your bag...it seems like they know you're going to rip into one of the other packages, if they don't! Come with cash & chose practically anything...sandwich meat, sausages or the uber yummy beer-case cheese!  Every time in, there are usually some Europeans shopping there which also validates the legitimacy of this fine establishment!

"Nothing I love more than German sausage! And when it's authentic, I can't stop smiling - just standing in the store hearing orders in Deutsch sends me over the moon!! Today I just grabbed 2 wieners and 2 bratwurst as I patiently await my sauerkraut I've got brewing in my crock at home. Homemade cheese and cabbage soup with authentic fried wiener on top and I've got myself heaven. Have always wanted to stop in here and now I have a reason to make it a constant in my life!!

"I had a horrible experience with towing. I called and told them my car needed to be towed because it was dripping gasoline. When the tow truck arrived the driver said he could not tow my car because it was dripping gasoline. They then told me I needed to have it cleared by the fire department before they could tow it. I called the fire department and they said they don't provide that service. It would've been nice if AAA had told me they couldn't tow it in the first place before I wasted my day waiting for them. A different towing company towed it without problem. AAA towing was a waste of money for me.

"You would think their exorbitant prices would at least buy some decent customer service. Not at this location. They are totally understaffed and have almost nobody able or willing to help you find anything. This is a problem because they carry so many completely different products that it's hard to find what you need. Expect to wait at least a half hour before getting assistance.The organization is disjointed, especially depending on your project. There's even a section called ""art supplies"". I thought that was kind of the point of the whole store. What did it in however was how miserably they packed my picture frames. The place next door wrapped two dollar drinking glasses in paper to protect them, but apparently Michael's thinks a grocery bag is sufficient to protect a nice picture frame in bad weather. So, the inevitable happened and I dropped the bag. Now I don't expect every place to be sympathetic, even though it could have been packed better, but when I asked for a refund they were down right RUDE. Hey I did drop the thing, but some empathy would have been nice. I wasn't completely out of line asking because a little bubble wrap and it would have been fine in the first place. I will never be back to this or any other Michael's.

"Of the Michaels in Charlotte this one is probably the one I like the least.  The store always looks terrible, but that is partially due to it being an older store.  The other reason the store looks so terrible is because its a mess (empty and disorganized shelves)!  I'm not sure if this store is physically smaller than the other Michaels in the area, but it definitely lacks selection.  Lastly, our cashier wasn't friendly and seemed like she was being in convinced by having to ring up customers.  For these reasons I generally go to Hobby Lobby or wait until I'm on the other side of Charlotte to go to a different Michaels.

"How does this place stay in business It's never a good shopping experience here and I've never seen it busy. Coming here, I feel as if I'm raiding the owner's personal collection. You're not allowed to browse and he will frequently tell you so.One time I asked the owner to order something for me and he REFUSED because he would ""only make $1 off it."" So I went to G-Mart and they ordered it for me instead.Conversations with the owner are bound to be interesting -- like the fact that he wants to have a funeral pyre when he dies -- but most people I know are made uncomfortable by going there. Apparently our two kinds of geek do not mesh.G-Mart has a better selection and the employees are helpful and funny.

"I was in this shop once when I was picking up my girlfriend. She was still finishing her final paper after a 2 week crash course that kicked off her graduate school education. Mind you I said grad school, yes I am a fully grown man in his early thirties with a girlfriend who is in grad school. Not a 18 year old undergrad with no money. I was just killing time and saw this shop. I stopped in to browse, as I was browsing I knelt down to get a better look at some books on the bottom shelf grabbed one to figure out what exactly it was,  this takeing maybe a full 10 seconds. Mind you I'm kneeling (not a comfortable position that I would stay in for long) and the guy behind the counter comes tells me that your not allowed to sit on the floor and read. I look at him like Huh! I explain I am kneeling and wasn't even reading just looking. He points to a sign and says ""those are the rules"" rather rudely. I take the 3 books I had in hand (and was planning on buying) put them back on the shelf and walk out. I haven't been treated that bad in a store since I was 12. Judging from the other reviews this guy isn't very friendly and his store is kinda dirty. I mean really when was the last time you dusted dude Your little model cars on the wall were filthy.

"I went into this Michael's with two items to return. I noticed that there was only one cashier and a line 5 people deep, but luckily there was an employee behind the service desk. As I stood waiting to talk with her I realized the people she was talking to were not customers but two other employees, and the three of them were bitching about a customer who had wanted to make a return and how annoying she had been. Then one of them (Nancy) noticed me standing there, turns around and says to me ""you're making a return you can get in the regular line."" seriously did you really just suggest that your conversation is so much more critical than helping a customer that I should go wait in another line that's very interesting Nancy, thanks. Meanwhile the other two don't even look at me, including the one manning the service desk. what the hell!I walk over to the one open register and wait for about 15 minutes while this one cashier works through all the people ahead of me. And I kid you not, when I was one person away from freedom, Nancy noticed that there were 3 people behind me, opened up a register and told the woman BEHIND ME to come over. Frankly I think all three of those employees should be fired for wasting Michael's and my time while getting paid. I'm sure they make crap pay but that is no excuse for flagrant laziness. It has cost Michael's my business.

Notice that It's 3 days later than 919 and I have not yet received a call from them telling me my frame STILL isn't ready, but I have also called multiple times since Monday and I sit on hold for 10-20 minutes only to find out they still haven't done my frame.  If you quote a date, it needs to be available to be picked up that day or before in my opinion.  After speaking to the manager just now, he says they have ""125 customers that they deal with weekly in the framing dept.""  uh-huh.  That's NOT that many customers for a big name store and if they can't get their s*** together by the day they say they will, then they better back it up with a phone call or in the future recommend a later day that the item should be finished and ready for pickup.

Nevertheless, I came, I saw, I left empty handed as nothing (in truth, not one little thing) in my entire basket rang up as it was marked on the shelf.  I don't know if it is incompetence, stupidity, or a laudable ""I don't give a flying f"" attitude that makes this the worst Michaels in the area, but I am not sure I have the time to devote to studying the subject matter.  I think my favorite part of today's experience was when the third item rang up wrong and I told the cashier, she said ""oh"" and looked blindly like a deer in headlights. No ""I'll check on that for you,"" no ""do you still want it,"" just a blank stare.  Sadly, I'll be back next week because this is the closest one when I am out and about.

"This Michaels is the foundation of my theory that some chains stay in business despite the reality that shoppers loathe them, because there's no adequate substitute. It's the only source of craft supplies that's handy while running errands in central Phoenix, and it's near one of the movie theaters that serves real food, so I shop here occasionally, and I always leave crabby.Every section is tiny and understocked. If something at another Michaels catches your eye, but you postpone buying it, and you figure, oh, you'll pick it up at this one because you're here... no, you won't. Wood trim, wood embellishments, specific acrylic paint colors, specific scrapbook paper designs, the edgiest floral items... forget it. This Michaels will not carry that. The staff will explain, with varying levels of chagrin, that ""this is the smallest Michaels in the region.""That much is obvious. It's so small that it's impossible for two carts to pass in most aisles. The major reason to set foot in this store is that you're desperate for tacky glue and can't face the chaos of Walmart. It has so far not found an excuse to stop carrying tacky glue. There was also a moment of hope when the chain introduced Martha Stewart acrylic paints, which are at least interesting colors. But I'd really like to know whose bright idea it was that, chain-wide, acrylic paints should now be displayed entirely below knee level. Let me give you a hint, gentlemen: the tiny bottles of exotic colors are not bought by children. Nor is there a gigantic acrylic-painting movement among Munchkins. Your acrylic paint buyers are adults, which means we're mostly over 5 feet tall, and depending how the day went and how high of heels we're wearing, our urge to indulge in a series of deep knee bends can vary. A lot. But it's rarely a matter of: ""oh great! I'm going to Michaels so I can skip the squats at the gym!""

She also lacked any confidence in her sentence when she said, ""Yeah, I think so,"" in reference to where they weren't.)The most helpful woman there let us know that they didn't carry the fabric paint we needed, which wad disappointing but at least honest.They in general don't seem to care about customer service in the front since there were 6 people talking and two of those people were cashiering. The other four were ignoring the line of waiting customers while chatting with each other, and the chatter was not work related either. Then, after ten minutes of waiting in line as the next customers, one cashier took people behind us while the other took someone not even waiting in line! Ridiculous!To say the least, the crafts have to sell themselves and thank goodness for the employees here that artists and people that do crafts on a regular basis find the need to buy supplies here or this place would be out of business quickly if based only on the customer service.

After I finished and he was giving me my yarn in no bag I said thank you again he ignored me, I snapped I said your welcome that's what u say after someone thanks you or at least acknowledge me!

First some of the hardware didn't arrive, then it came in the wrong finish, then the didn't include as stated drapery hooks and they are back ordered till Jan. 2014. Then hung a pair of drapes and the other pair for another window in the same room wasn't the length stated, then I called to have the right length sent. Oh sorry mam, they have been discontinued you will have to take down the pair you just hung and order something else and by the way it is going to cost you an additional $200 dollars. 4.5 mos. later I am still dealing with their screw ups. Ordered a very a very large and heavy coat rack. A friend and I worked on this for 3 hours, it should have taken no more than 30 min. We could not get it together because it didn't line up. Sorry mam, you will have to pack up this very large and heavy item and set it out to be picked up. Have spent a lot of $$$$ and would have had better service and products had I gone to Walmart.

"I'm a huge fan of Kohls and moving to the Charlotte area has pushed me to find a different Kohls than the one I always went to an hour away. And here it goes, from the many other Kohls that I've stepped foot on, this is the most disorganized department store I've been to. The prices are higher than other Kohls' for the EXACT same product. I purchased a cardigan for $21 at the Charlotte Kohls while the day after I visited my hometown Kohls and found the exact cardigan for $15. That was a return. The selection in this Kohls is so poor. I asked an associate if she could help me find a pencil skirt in the middle of the summer and she said that they don't carry skirts. How can they not carry skirts!! Last week I stopped by to get the battery of my watch changed. I purchased this watch for $250 at their store and when I asked the lady to change my battery she told me that she is afraid to do it because she broke her watch changing the battery. Are you kidding me You also have to pay for a battery change while other Kohls change it for free. I love Kohls but everytime I've been to this store I've gotten an attitude from most of the associates and never been able to find a good deal so I've stopped going.

"I received a PJ set as a gift from my Mom for Christmas. She paid $19.20 for the top and $19.20 for the pants which = $38.40 total.  Unfortunately, they were too big, so I had to return them for store credit. Upon doing so, I was told that the items were now on sale, and that they would only refund me the sale price, which was $14.39 per piece, plus they were deducting the $10.00 Kohl's bucks that she received for the purchase. So, my Mom paid $38.40 for the PJ's and because they did not fit and I had to return them, I was given $20.05.  The Kohl's cash I almost get, but not refunding the original price paid for the items is bull! But the taking the Kohl's cash promo away from the gift receiver is crap as well. It's a promotion the store is doing and as it turns out, it's just a big money maker.   I will never shop at Kohl's again, and I will ask my friends to do the same. Especially if for a gift. Not a happy customer. Goodbye Kohl's

"How incredibly pathetic.  I just had the worst experience at Red.  Then I get on Yelp and realize how many others have come to the same conclusion--enough to write about it!  How can a store possibly survive if you are treated so poorly.  Wow.  I was seriously shocked--zero personality and 100% icy and rude--as if they didn't even want you in the store.  So why did they open one  Even if I found the perfect piece, I would never buy from RED MODERN FURNITURE.  People buy from people.  It is about time the owner figured that out.

"Mid century furniture is supposed to be warm, welcoming, and approachable. Not here. Almost every piece of furniture had a sign on it: ""do not touch"" or ""do not sit"". It felt more like an overpriced museum. When I asked the owner about all the signs, she said ""I don't go to a luxury car dealership and sit in all the cars I can't afford. People who buy a really nice piece of furniture here don't want something that everyone has sat their butt on."" I'll never waste my time there again.

"So I came on here to ""Rag on Red."" Looks like a LOT of people beat me to it. After having a great brunch at St. Francis across the parking lot, my boyfriend and I decided to take a peek in. Well, first of all, I wasn't sure there was anyone there for a while. Which was fine, we just kept looking around and being goofy looking at all the cool old stuff that they have to offer. As we made our way through the store I found who I could only make out as a sales man sitting in front of some lady on a computer. They bothered themselves to greet us at that point. Never getting out of their seats at any point of our visit. (I've worked my way through collegelaw school doing retail, big no-no not greeting customers and making them feel un-welcomed).Soooo... I was mindlessly walking around the furniture portion of the store when.......GASSSSSPPPP! I tapped on some of the furniture with my finger nail!!! You would have though I had taken a hammer to it with their reaction. I was admiring their selection and not reading all the little signs about not touching anything. Whatever.I was annoyed with them not wanting me to touch anything but alas, its their store, if they don't want people to enjoy their products that's their business. What blew my top was when my boyfriend (who is very friendly and is always interested in what a business has to offer) asked them a question about a chair. An Egg Chair. You would have thought he sounded like a babbling idiot because their answers where so pretentious and condescending. He asked about other things they had in the store and they had the same cold attitude everyone else on here talks about.  Anyway, I'm assuming that the majority of the their actual customers come from web sales because there is no way anyone I know would spend that kind of money on furniture when the sales staff is acting like they're doing you a favor by allowing you to breath in their precious vintage air.

"I was so excited to check out this store. Living in a vintage building and flush with cash, I felt it was the best prospect for furnishing my apartment. However after spending a few minutes in the store I felt cold, alienated and stupid,For starters I was never greeted, my presence acknowledged, or even asked how my day was. The store was empty upon my arrival, and it was not until I dared to touch an item that my presence was acknowledged....albeit with a condescending and rude outburst by the stores owner. I thought the furniture was vintage and original....apparently they refinish and refurbish furniture and pass it off as found vintage. I was told by the owner that most of e furniture was recently shellacked....and was not in display condition. I also had the unfortunate experience of asking the staff about several pieces I was interested in. Between eye rolls and deep sighs I was told of the inaccuracies in my question, yet never told if I could purchase the items or not. After being deemed too dumb to engage in a conversation by the woman minding the store I was handed over to the stores owner with a sigh, an eye roll, and a rather condescending ""do you want to handle this"". The stores owner than continued to alienate and insult me, making me feel dumb and rather small. It seems as though the storefront is a showroom for their online sales, as most items are not for sale...and anything that is worthwhile is plastered with ""do not touch"" signage. Very unhospitable for a furniture store, as I usually like to sit in something before I purchase it. I'm not going to even go into the prices, which seem as alienated from reality as the stores owner or his assistant; two ageing hipsters locked in a battle for who could be snootier or more pretentious. Aside from the nasty staff, the lack of  hospitality and the god-awfull smell inside the store I would say the store was acceptable. I'm sure this store will survive, as most online customers probably don't know that they are getting refurbished furniture stored in a putrid cat-urine smelling environment and sold by condescending belittling better-than-thou hipsters. ......avoid this store, check out the wonderful vintage stores elsewhere in town.

"Went to see if they had any liquid for my ecig and whoever was there was watching tv with someone on a couch and acted like I was bothering him by coming in and didn't have any knowledge about the products I was looking at. I asked what they were and if he knew if any of them were good and he just shrugged and said ""I dunno, I don't use that stuff."" I understand if you don't personally use every item in your store, but you should at least be a little more knowledgable about the things you carry and maybe try and act a little more friendly in the future. I don't need sunshine and rainbows, but at least don't look annoyed that I just interrupted what you were doing.Suffice to say, I won't be returning here.

"I ended up moving over to Gilbert recently and saw that there was a smoke shop. I dropped in because I had quit smoking and wanted a zero nicotine e cig to help me with kicking cigs. When I walked in I had a guy show me the e cigs. He told me the cartridge was non refillable after the first try, which was really odd. However, I figured I would buy one anyway since I can have two cartridges. Well, they sold me a $16 cartridge that doesn't even fit my e cig. Ridiculous that he blatantly lied to me. Never coming here again.

"Yuk-O. I work just down the street and read the reviews so thought it would be great. Wrong! They gyro was ok, but the salad that came with it was nasty, wilted lettuce with a brown slice of tomato and a blob of dressing. Their prices are too expensive for lunch and to top it off the girl working take out was totally snotty and rude when I asked some questions about the menu. This one is a pass for me.

"Horrible service!!!I was visiting from LA and we hav tons of hookah places. Since the moment we sat down they gave us a huge attitude. After seating us it took them over 10minutes to even akcnowledge us. They had only 4 other tables so not busy at all and the waiter visited them several times before he even responded to me flaging him down. I asked him for any hoolah he would like to bring us. 10min later the hookah arrived but we had to wait another 5 mins to get charcol. They put this tiny charcols which went out in a few minutes. I actuallt had to get up and go to ask for more. Then i asked the waiter is he can give me a menu to order some food and something to drink. He said ohh the kitchen is closed. I said well can I atleast get a drink He said sure and got me a beer.  The interesting part was that they continued serving the other tablea with food atleast 30minutes after i asked him. Service is the key in these kind of business. I guess that is acceptable in Arizona but this place would not survive one day in LA. Poor management...

"I visited red sea a couple of years ago, and I really liked the atmosphere and the service. I'm sorry to report that things have changed and I will not be visiting red sea again. I visit different hookah bars often and I must say this is one of the worst experiences I have had. The bowl got over heated and instead of fixing the problem, he took the coals off and told us to wait... Really The Shisha is burned to the top of the screen, waiting is not going to help. I could have just smoked my hookah at home.

"Absolutely disgusted by how this place made no attempt on their website or elsewhere besides a piece of paper on the door saying they are closed. Staying on the strip getting a taxi to this place was not cheap expecting it to be open to find it isn't. Service has been horrible on many occasions.

"this place was horrible, first of all theres no sign saying the drinks are non alcoholic, the staff is rude, i came in with a party of 7 and the place was empty other than two different tables, yet it took them 5 mins to seat us, we then ordered two hookahs one banana split and the other pumpkin pie neither of them tasted like what they were supposed to, and on top of that they loaded it with so many coals so it was harsh the whole time. we asked them to fix it and they just started blowing in the bottom of the tobacco holder burning at least half of the bowl of tobacco. we tried it again it was still burning hot, and the pumpkin pie tasted like shit, we asked for a different flavor and they told us they were going to charge us for another hookah. so we told them to fix it then. they brought it back and it still tasted like shit. floor cleaner to be exact. finally they give in and get us a different flavor, mind you its now been 2 hours we've been there now. they never came back to add more coals, and the unlv girl that works there has a bad attitude.  so when we go to leave they charged us for the third hookah that replaced the pumpkin floor cleaner flavor. i will never go to this place again. and i hope they go out of business

"This place was empty came here twice. Mabe 2 groups at the most were in here. Ultra high prices Hookahs cost 20 to 30 dollars its nuts. They don't smoke that great and the guy working there was a little creepy he would pop up all over the place. The prices where just outrageous there's palace in summerlin that's way cheaper and nicer. I would npt recommend this place.

"Red has some how managed to make every hookah mistake in the book and added a few of their own as well. If I could give this place negative stars I woud not hesitate. I am astounded at how this place stays in business. Red can be found in a decrepit strip mall behind a dunkin donuts next a equally miserable discount movie theater on Tropicana and Pecos. They used have a location up in summerlin but moved down there when they couldn't pay the bills.To begin, the prices and policies are outrageous. Each hookah will average anywhere from $20-30 maybe more. This is pretty much double the price of most other lounges in town. For some reason, Red charges additional fees to mix flavors and its not cheap. Every additional flavor can tack another 2 bucks to each hookah. To accompany this overpriced hookah is of course overpriced drinks. And what weird drinks they have. Lounges like this that do no aspire to obtain a beer and wine license usually sell an assorments of drinks, teas, smoothies and the like. Red, however, feels compelled to offer non-alcoholic beers and non-alcoholic wines (yes they exisit). After seeing their drink selection, I wasn't sure if I should laugh or cry.Now keep in mind, I don't always mind paying more if its worth it, but this is definitely not the case at red. The hookah is absolutely dreadful. I don't think my words could describe the disaster that they bring to your table. The hookahs take forever to start and when they do get going, they taste like burnt tobacco. If your favorite flavors are charcoal and ash this definitely the place for you. The biggest culprit behind this atrocious mess is the lounge's insistence on using insta-light coals. They toss these coals on to the bowl and lock it under a metal funnel designed to contain the coal if the hookah falls over. On top that they actually demand an extra 5 bucks or so for a ""re-light."" I was left speechless when I was actually asked to pay another 5 bucks for another coal.The atmosphere and lounge itself does nothing to redeem the hookahs here either. You will find CRT television sets displayed proudly around the lounge. I don't know why they keep the relics around. The place would be actually somewhat attractive if they got rid of them and opened the place up a bit. I have never seen it busy or even half-packed.There are plenty of great lounges in vegas, do yourself a favor and stay far far away from this place.

"This place is so horrible. My friends and I waited for about 30 minutes to be seated, then another 20 to get our hookah. On hip hop night, it seems like there are 16 year old girls dancing on the walls. It's so ridiculous. This place smells absolutely terrible. I don't know how people out here in Nevada do hookah out here.. But being from Southern Cali, our hookah lounges are 1 million times better.

"If I had a chance I would rate this place as -1. Was on my way to another place but did not check the timings and the place was closed when I reached. Quickly searched for other mediterranean places nearby and called Olive to find out if the place was open. The guy on the phone seemed very friendly and asked me what I would like to order and he could have it ready for pickup. I asked him if I could taste the chicken before ordering it and he said that would be fine. I am a new and very reluctant chicken eater in my quest to eat more protein so based on this info, I decided to head over to this place.The billing desk was swamped with several waitresses, and yet it took me a few minutes to request for someone's assistance and look at the menu. It took even longer to get someone to take my order.  The girl I spoke to, told me that they did not have sample options and I could not taste to see. I understood but told her about my phone convo few minutes ago with someone at their restaurant. She went to get an older lady who was possibly the manager or something, Mona. The woman told me that they could not me taste anything as they need to prepare big batches of food for each order seperately. Her tone seemed condescending and even though I was ready to walk out of the place, I decided to order the chicken na na as they told me it was good.The chicken na na was supposed to be a tender marinated chicken served with lettuce and tomato and house garlic sauce. I asked for the dish without the pita bread, to take out. Now, I may be wrong here but I think I read the price as 6.95 but the waitress charged 8.95 plus tax for this.The only thing worth mentioning in the dish was the garlic sauce in a yogurt base and it was pretty good. The chicken was dry with what seemed like herbs and spices thrown over. There was nothing tender about the chicken and I ended up taking a few bites and wasting the rest.Cannot comment on the ambience as I took my order to go. They could seriously benefit by having a few customer oriented staff members and improving the quality of food.Very dissapointed and will not return even if this is the only place food is available.

"I'm going to start off by saying that this review is pretty much exclusively for the service. I have been here several times with my boyfriend (we have never had a service issue until now) and the hookah is always good, the drinks are so-so but reasonably priced and I absolutely LOVE the decor. However, after last night, I'm not sure I will ever patronize this place again. If I could give it 0 stars, I would. My boyfriend and I were meeting up with his uncle and friend who were already there. When we got there, we needed to be moved to a bigger table since they were sitting at a two seat one. It took us 5 minutes to get the waitress to come over, despite that there were only three other small groups in the place. When she did come over, she rolled her eyes and made a snarky comment about us moving table (the only thing we had was a hookah that needed to be moved...and she put us at the next table over so I would think that wouldn't be a big deal).After we moved, she disappeared for 20 minutes. When we were finally able to get drinks, she disappeared for another 45 minutes (this is not an exaggeration either). During the whole visit, this server made us feel like we were inconveniencing her by being in her breathing space when we asked her for anything. Her attitude made the whole group uncomfortable every time she would come over and, though we had intended to get some dinner as well while we were there, we finally got tired of being scared to ask her for anything so we just requested the bill. When we nicely asked her to split it (and I was being beyond patient at this point. I'm not someone who loses my temper with servers), she gave us a disgusted look and took an incredibly short, nasty tone with us but ultimately did it. This was, no embellishing, the worst and rudest service I have ever received in my life. My boyfriend and I were more than happy to leave and go across the street the Blue Fin, where they were more than happy to have our business.

"I came here for a friends surprise birthday party. I arrived around 9 pm so it was pretty empty in the place. I was surprised at the size and amount of chairs they have to seat people. Very nice, dark layout. It could deem as a great place to chill and hang out with friends after a long day. However, the service here is a bit lacking. There were a lot of waitresses that night and they were huddling around the bar anticipating whether or not it'd be a busy night as I heard through their conversations. It was really dead and it was my first time there so I had no idea how it was on a busy night. I was really hungry while waiting for more people to arrive so I ordered a beef wrap and some hummus. Both weren't bad at all. I thought it was weird that the server took my card and opened up a tab for me as I was intentionally planning on not drinking that night, but I didn't say anything about it to her anyway. More people started arriving about an hour later and the lounge gradually started filling up as well. We had a whole row of seats and couches for our party, but as more people started showing up the servers started to get anxious as we were flowing out of the specific area they had for us. There were also several hookahs out. It seemed as if they didn't want all that business for them or couldn't handle that many people. They ended up making all of us get up and relocate into this bland side room which was away from all the music so it was a really weird atmosphere. It wasn't as comfortable as the lounge seating they had for typical guests, but they said we were taking up too much room out there apparently. We did not get much service in this room either. I understand it turned into a pretty busy night, but I think they could've used another waitress or two to staff our large party. When I finally received my tab at the end of the night, I noticed they double charged me on my bill. The waitress seemed a little upset about this even though it wasn't my fault claiming that someone else had charged me extra, not her, but she refunded me in cash so it was okay. The whole ordeal and events of the night made me feel like I never wanted to come back again. At least the people I was with made the night a little more enjoyable.

"Looks like it's back to the drawing boards with Submission. We had been asked last minute by Hookah Palace to run our weekly promotion giving us two days to prepare for the first week. Needless to say it was a flop. Then week two was a little better, yet we did not bring down the house. Any good promoter will tell you that it is almost impossible to pack a place the size of a football field, that does not already have clientele in the first week and a half of promotion. We need to be cleaver and run several promotions and develop a crowd. Yet Hookah Palace was disappointed that we did not create a miracle. Hookah Palace decided to let us know when we accidentally called them that we would no longer be welcome there. This was on Tuesday, two days prior to the event, flyers were printed, invites were sent out, extra promoters were hires. We were also getting ready to set up our DJ battle which we discussed with Hookah Palace would run for five weeks. I guess we were lucky in that we did not start that up as soon as we would hope. In the end we are disappointed with Hookah Palace and the way they operate. Don't cancel on someone two days prior to an event. Last time House of DON Productions will operate under a gentleman's agreement, that is for sure. Thank you for listening. Douglas FarraPresidentHouse of DON Productions

"This place sucks hairy balls. Expensive tiny weak drinks and a cover charge on some nights. It is in a crappy off strip location so you would think there would be an incentive to encourage patrons to visit and come back.

Started with the Spanakopita, which was labelled as a Spinach Cheese Pie for $3.95.  It was cold.  What should have been flaky heavenly goodness in the form of phyllo dough was just greasy congealed torture, which was quite impressive with how this was so damn cold.  Maybe they should've left this in the microwave longer.  Blah.Entree that was recommended as their house specialty was their oven roasted lamb for $11.95.  It was halfway edible as the rice was sorta interesting with pine nuts for a nice crunch, but was a little dry.  And then the lamb.  It probably wouldn't be fair to say it was dry, it would be more fair to say it was Arizonan desert sand masquerading as meat.  Damnit, so disappointed again I can't even think of a witty way to end this review.  God bless the edit button, I'll have to come back with something.

"The owner was nice but very pushy on me ordering the specials. They didn't have what I wanted (grilled chicken burger) so I went with a falafel which seemed to upset him. My order came with soup, I chose lentil. That was very good. The falafel however was just not good at all. My tastebuds just could not agree with the sauce or ingredients.

"This was the first Mediterranean place I had in AZ. I didn't feel like making dinner that night and was craving falafel, so I looked on Yelp and found the 4 star review, one of the highest and closest to me. The pictures looked authentic and delicious. I should've stayed home and saved my money. It's a hole in the wall, which I ordinarily like and can be a good indication of authenticity. The 1 star is for an attempt at a restaurant. The atmosphere and service wasn't bad. The falafel though -- worst I've ever had. It's dried out and flavorless. I judge a Mediterranean place on how good their falafel is, and this was terrible. I hardly wanted to finish it but did because I was hungry. The server -- I think he was the owner -- recommended a red wine, and I sprang for it. It was almost skunked, so he clearly pushed it on me to get rid of it. Gross.

"This was the worst Persian food I have ever had. The service was even worse than the food. I will never go there again, I have been in many persian restaurants in LA and the Bay Area, this one stands at the bottom of the list. I recommend anything else but Habib.

"Avoid it. Owner is crazy and does not treat customers with respect.

"I had heard some things about the owner (Habib) saying that he was a rude person etc etc. During the time I lived in Las Vegas I dined there 2 or 3 times and didn't experience anything too bad BUT during my last visit during a trip to Las Vegas I had an experience with the owner that makes me doubt that I will ever be going back again. I had always heard that the owner was rude and finally saw it with my own eyes.Habib was taking our order. My mother asked if the fish was fresh and Habib said yes. My father asked again in the most polite words and soft spoken, friendly, respectful tone of voice if the fish was fresh or fresh frozen (my dad eats a lot of fish!) Habib SNAPPED back in a rude, confrontational and aggressive tone of voice and said ""I already answered you once! I do not need your business!"" I was frankly shocked. This was after my father had earlier paid him a compliment on his restaurant when we first got there. Frankly it ruined our mood, our meal and whole evening. My mother at this point preferred to leave but we were already there, settled in, tired from travel and we stayed and ate our food.The persian food here is reasonably good. Nothing spectacular but not disappointing. The prices are high for what is offered though. There are other places in town with better persian food (see reviews for Royal Persis and form your own opinion) but the physical location etc is not quite as nice, although my limited interactions with the owner there have been pretty pleasant. The inside of Habib's is more upscale, say, if you wanted to bring a guest from out of town, but frankly with an owner that can pop off at any moment does it really matter He can ruin any physical attributes the restaurant has with a few words.The other wait staff were pretty friendly. I think they may know that the owner acts the way he does and may try to make up for it (or are just trying to avoid pissing him off themselves).

"NO STAR! Went to Habib's with my elder parentsfamily, Habib the owner also server snapped impatiently right when we walked-in to get seated.  He seemed to be having a bad day and took it out on my parents and I.  He took my moms order and when my mom mentioned she does not want her food overly cooked he was impatient and rude.  My dad wanted to get seated over by the window and he was denied.  When he asked for an explanation, Habib said to him I'm diabetic and can not carry the food from the kitchen to the widow seat near the entry where my dad preferred to get seated.  Habib said to my dad I'm the owner also management here and I won't allow you to sit there if you don't like it then leave.  By then Habib had taken five of our orders, when it was my turn to order, I was the only one at the table who's order was not taken by Habib, taken-back by Habib's rude behavior I set down the menu and didn't want to order food, therefore, he asked me to leave on front of my family and raced to my seat as well as personal space as if he's going to hit me.  I got up, words were exchanged and he ran to the front grabbing a phone and threatening to call the police.  We were certainly not treated with any respect.I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS RESTAURANT TO ANYONE.  Habib is a rude jerk and don't know what else to say. That was 30 minutes into our arrival to Las Vegas and starting our family vacation.

"The owner was absolutely rude. I came with 3 friends, he was acting as if we own him for coming there. Food was ok, not the best persian food i tried but not the worse. Too bad the owner does ruin his business with his attitude because i would of came back if it wasnt for horrible service i received. Too bad he lost 4 customers because none of us will support this business

"I took a party of 6 friends and co-workers there last week when attending a tradeshow in Vegas ... I will never do that again!Biggest issue:  The bill came and I noticed just about 30% added to the bill as ""tax"" ... yes, 30%!  When I asked the server about it, he said that that includes 18% as service fee and 8.1% as tax ... and that that is explained in the menu.  I have several issues with this:1. Shame on me for not reading the menu and the fine print ... my mistake, but if you are reading this review, you don't have to make this mistake.2. Why am I forced to leave an 18% tip  The tip is not at my discretion.  If the server is not helpful, I can't express myself in any way.  3. Why is listed as ""tax""  I bet you most people do not even see it and add tip on top of it automatically!!!  That is stealing!4. Now, it gets worse:  I asked the server that if there is an 18% service fee plus an 8.1% tax, that adds up to 26.1%.  So, why is there an almost 30% charge  They add 8.1% to the bill and then they add 18% tip on top of it.  So, the effective percentage for tip is higher than 18%.Food:  It was no special in any way.  I am very familiar with Persian food.  I have had it in many cities and many countries.  I look for Persian restaurants everywhere I go.  This restaurant is not bad but it is not good either.  The food in NO WAY justifies the prices they charge!  I had chicken with bones, and it was not cooked well.  For appetizer, we had tadig which the crispy rice that is cooked in the bottom of the pan, and we had it with two kinds of stew.  Tadig was good but not enough for 6 people.  Stews were OK, but again not special.Service:  It was OK.  The server was not really pleasant: smiling or welcoming.  He was not rude or anything, but I felt like we were bothering him being there.  And the place was not busy.  The service in NO WAY justified more than 18% in tip.  But think about it the guy didn't care because he knew he will get his tip any way.  I will not recommend this place:  not for food, not for service and not for being overcharged!

"Habibbbbbb is the rudest, meanest, uglyist, guy I have ever seen as a owner of restaurant. He treats his persian customer so badly, like he is living in Iran or Afghanestan.  He thinks persian people here don't have any right in his restaurant.  last time we were a party of 10 . waiting 2 hours , not that it was crowded , but because he just had one waiter.  the worker are terrified of him.  The food has very low quality, small portion , uncooked, but the price was so high. He charged 35% gratitude which comes with the bill and we had no choice , but to pay.  Bad experience , never go back and don't suggested to anyone. don't let the environment follish you.

"First if there is a way to give zero stars, I would give it. I took my friends with his kids and my family there for lunch while visiting the city for a trade show. Shame on me for not reading the reviews!Waiter: The waiter, like others reported on their reviews, was the owner. He was rude, impatient and not interested in providing a traditional service. My son is only tow years old, and ordering a whole meal would have been a waste. So, I politely asked if I could have an extra plate. Waiter was fast to add that he charges $5 for sharing a plate. The first time I heard of such foolish charge.  Our table was in an area where the waiter couldn't reach three of my guests, and we told him that we can pass things down to him. He got upset and made a snappy remark. Food:  The food was about average.  Most of us ordered the same dish, and we all had meat that were not cooked all the way. We mentioned it to him at the end of our meal just to bring it to his attention. All and all the experience was horrible, and I do t recommend this to anyone.

"This is the worst service (or worst non-service) I have ever experienced. Since I can't give zero stars, I'm giving the service one. We didn't eat anything so I can't comment on the food. My husband and I went to Buffalo Blues last night. We stood at the empty hostess stand for a while. When no one came to seat us, and we couldn't find anyone to seat us, we seated ourselves figuring that's what we were supposed to do.The bar was full, but not packed. There were only two other tables with guests, one of which had empty plates on the table during this entire experience. After what seemed like forever, my husband got up to find a server. He literally walked around the restaurant to find someone, but couldn't. He then tried to ask the bartender, but she was just as elusive. When he finally found a server,  she acted totally shocked that we were there. Maybe if someone had been doing their job, they wouldn't be surprised to find hungry people in a restaurant.She came to our table, got our drinks (a soda and a water) and asked us if we were ready to order. When we said no she said she would be back. We could see her chit chatting with another server, but again, couldn't get her attention to come back to take our order. After another ten minutes of waiting for her to return, we put a few dollars on the table for my soda and we left. We ordered a pizza at a local shop and picked it up on our way home.Twenty-five minutes passed and we only get drinks Such a waste of time. It took us 20 minutes just to make the drive there, 25 of waiting, and another 20 to get home. That's over an hour of our evening completely wasted which left us starving after a hard days work. I used to work as a server so I could understand if the place was busy and the staff was short handed, but it was basically a dead night table top wise. I will NEVER go back.

"I hate this place. I have been here many times and I am just finally getting around to writing a review.  Let me state that my wife made me go here tonight because my friends wanted to and she said I need to indulge their interests. Even if they suck. Buffalo Blues is like a Hooters, except the girls where more clothes and are not as good looking. The service is horrendous and the food may be better at Hooters.  The beer selection is decent at Buffalo Blues but it is expensive and they often run out of things that are still on the board.My friends like going for all you can eat wing night but frankly I don't get it. You get 10 wings up front they will give more wings 5 at a time. The problem is that you get those wings in 30 minute intervals.  So the max you could eat is 55 wings. Did I mention that  the wings are really tiny and the sauce is tossed on like a Jackson Pollack painting.  They also charge extra for blue cheese or ranch.  The wings do not come with celery. This is a crime against humanity and the city of Buffalo.  I chose to detour from wings tonight and ordered a chicken sandwich. Apparently this was a bad choice.  It took a full hour to get my food. It was so long that the rest of the table ate their wings and ordered more and the waitress didn't think this was a problem. When my meal did arrive everything was cold. The sandwich was ok, but the fries were just tiny pieces that were limp and flavorless.I paid $16 for a beer and a sandwich that my friends had to wait for me to eat to leave.  I would say I won't go back, but apparently I like my friends more than I like good food and service.

"Went here this past Saturday afternoon, 112. My friends and I sat at the pretty much empty bar for over 5 minutes with no service. The bartender walked by us a few times and didn't even acknowledge we were there. As we walked out, we saw the bartender on the phone and other staff members standing in the back chatting. We went next door to Mad Mex and got much better service!

"To be honest, I think this is one of the worst bars in the entire city.  The food was sub-par, even for bar food, the service was awful, especially during a game. I do enjoy a good sports bar, but I think the thing I hated most about this place was the other people that frequent there. It's the quintessential Shadyside bar, equipped with doughebag bros that went to the same fraternity in college and the Jersey Shore bimbos who pine for them. The last time that I went there were two guys throwing up outside of the bar on the sidewalk. I fully admit this is a subjective review, because this bar was obviously not my scene- but I still do not like this place at all.

"Unfortunately, the service we were given ruined our overall experience at Buffalo Blues. We sat down and put in our drink order.  My husband was excited about the amount of beers they had on tap. Fifteen minutes later and still without drinks, we saw our server trying to hunt the bartender down. Once the bartender finally started working on our drinks, she realized the keg for the beer my husband ordered was tapped. We were sitting at the booths right next to the bar but instead of the bartender just telling us so we could make another decision and get our drinks as soon as possible, she waited for the waitress to come back to tell her. Then, the waitress came back and did not apologize at all but simply said that he had to pick a different beer because they were out of that one. Anyway, long story short, it took way too long to get drinks and there was never any recognition from the staff of the issue. The restaurant seemed poorly managed and subpar. We will not be back.

"Watched a bartender serve a guy a beer when he was visibly intoxicated. He was swaying in circles on the chair next to me. I told the manager about it and he told me ""that guy is just crazy, I've seen him much worse"" so I guess that makes it ok. Made this paying customer leave after one beer.

"I've been to Buffalo Blues a few times at Happy Hour, and met my daughter there last night for Happy Hour specials as advertised on the web site.  First clue:  no Happy Hour promos mentioned in the bar except for the Yeungs and Wings (which was not what we were looking for).  We came close to leaving as my beer was off the draft list, but we decided to stay and were disappointed that my daughter's choice was already gone although still ilsted.  The food was awful, the service worse.  Maybe a busser should clean the table after removing the dirty dishes--our table was a sticky  mess.  The service:  one beer to the table at a time.  Next round I saw two beers go to a three-top, removed and sent to the bar, poured out and the glasses refilled and brought to us.  Someone else's food was brought to our table, our fries came out --lukewarm---but our wing order never went in.  So we got our garlic parm wings which tasted like old overcooked chicken and was way too crispy and greasy for my taste.  We ate two each, then told the server we didn't want them.  She offered to take them off, but we told her that wasn't necessary, so they took off 12 the price as a Customer service gesture.  Still, we had a Happy Hour bill for 12 eaten fries, barely touched wings, and 6 drafts total of $45 at a dirty table.  At least the place was quiet--there were empty tables everywhere.  I think we're done here.

"First off, I like family restaurants and avoid chains when possible. Sometimes that's not possible - in the future I'll avoid this one no matter what.Its always a zoo, the servers are not interested in what they are doing, and do it poorly. Food comes out of order or not at all. The managers don't care. We actually had a waitress spill the soup, catch most of it in her hand, and dump it back in right in front of us. Then she gave it to us before thinking to ask if we wanted another. Just go anywhere else, it can't be worse!

"Normally one would think, one chain restaurant is just like the rest but I have had nothing but problems here. The staff appears to be constantly changing as does the managers which should tell you something. I've been there for lunch and dinner and continue to have issues. Here are just some of the problems that we have had: a co-worker had an entire glass of iced tea dropped on him and nothing was comped on his check; we have had to wait a very long time for our orders to be taken; I ordered the pick 2 and was told that the soup could not possibly come out first(even though I've done this before); they have argued with us over what the meal is supposed to come with to the point of us showing them a picture; and staff does not appear to be properly trained.

"Another overdone steak and utterly inattentive staff! Still sitting here waiting for someone to give a care.So, we finally got the attention of a server who was not our server, Michael. She was kind enough to take my steak back to the kitchen. Michael, our server, finally shows up 10 minutes later with a half-hearted apology and to let me know that my steak was being prepared again. He does not offer to refill our drink glasses that have now been sitting empty for 20 minutes. The manager makes an appearance and brings me a strip steak that looks rare from the sight of it. He informs me that my steak is on him and apologizes. He goes away. I cut into my steak and it's, you guessed it, Pittsburgh Rare. I asked for medium rare. He returns and I tell him that the chef needs to go back to culinary school and learn how to prepare a steak. The manager apologizes again and asks me if I want to take this pathetic piece of beef home with me! Not only is it rare but it's a cheap cut of strip steak that is loaded with connective gristle. I said no thanks. He comped my husband's meal and we left. I never hope for people to lose their jobs but the cook and the server really need some serious retraining! I will never go back to this Applebee's again.

"I have been robbed twice by the Saloon.  Someone there likes to write in tips so if you use a credit or debit card at the Saloon make ABSOLUTELY sure that you check you bank statement the next day. After the first time I wrote it up as a mistake on my part or their but the last time I was flabbergasted.  I went in on some Yeungling special night, ordered one beer, and wrote a dollar tip.  The next morning I checked my statement and I had been charged 25.00 for that single beer.  This is not only a bad business practice but it is illegal and fraud.  But they will keep saying it was an 'accident' as long as they can get away with it.  If you do have to go here I IMPLORE you to only use cash and look at your change carefully. This bar should be your absolute last resort in Mt Lebanon.At closing time as well, get ready for the Mt Lebo Police Dpt to pull up outside and start hassling people who are WALKING HOME.  There are other great bars in Mt Lebanon that are far more deserving of your money.

"First of all the website, as I was told, ""has been down for 4 years"" - even though it is very up. The specials and menu prices are apparently wrong.My friends and I chose this place solely based on the fact they had advertised $3.50 20 oz Guinness. We needed a place to celebrate our graduation. With a party of 4 that grew to 6 we found the place pretty crowded and loud after awhile. Mostly we were pissed off that we were told on our 3rd round that the Guinness we were drinking was actually $5.50....really, it wasn't even a full 20 oz glass, it was one of those damn plastic cups. When we ordered at the beginning of the night it was quiet and the bartender said nothing about the price. At that point we decided to go somewhere else because it really wasn't our kind of bar in the first place, and you can absolutely find much cheaper Guinness in this city. The guy didn't even apologize for the website - it's called false advertising, and it's a dick move, Mr. William Penn.

"I'm with Mike B. I have visited 2 Fox & Hound Bars now (the other up in Huntersville) - both get two thumbs down on the food. Both had good beer selection, TVs, and space. But the food - no. I got the fish sandwich at the Huntersville location - poor choice. I got the chicken sandwch at the Tryon location - looked like it belonged on the kids menu; and it took 30 minutes, so it was also dry. I initially thought I'd give the place a 2nd chance - 2 for 2 bad food experiences is enough.

"Simply a bad experience. A group of us came to Charlotte from Cheyenne for a training course and wanted a good local place have dinner and drinks. The place wasn't busy at all and it took 20 minutes from the time we sat down to get out drink order taken and get our beverages. The food took way too long as well and was only lukewarm. I assure you I will not return to this establishment on this trip or any future trips.

"This abomination certainly left much to be desired. There was a considearble wait from the ordering of drinks to receiving them, again to order food, and even longer to get our food. When it finally came, they had mixed up who ordered what, wrong sides with the entree, etc. All of our orders, from the 3 steaks to the sampler platter to the mini chili dogs, were lukewarm at best. One of the steaks even managed to taste like they had dropped it into the bottom of the grill. Think smokey, like campfire-smelling clothes smokey, but flavored that way.The manager comped a portion of our meals, but the apparent lack of cusomer service and quality control more than overshadowed his attempt to make things right. I refuse to EVER set foot in this sub-par establishment again.

"Groupon has allowed me to try new restaurants in places I never knew existed.I Have been to uptown many times and never noticed Fox and Hound. That could also be Rock Bottom Brewery sits across the street and makes this place seem so much smaller. My visit was at 2pm and we experienced some difficulty with parking. It also is DNC week and parking is off limits except for a few places along the street. Luckily we found one after circling 4 times. We walked in and it was awkward. One of those moments that you see in movies where a bar is noisy everyone stops and stares then goes about their business. Normally this isn't an issue but when the waitress and bartender does this its....awkward. We found a booth and sat and waited to be greeted. We waited, looked around and waited some more. Began looking around saw a bartender and that was it. No waitress no one else walking around. Wasn't sure if we should have sat at the bar to be noticed, or like in elementary school raise our hands to have permission to speak. It would have probably made a difference to recieve a smile or simple hello from the person behind the bar, then we probably wouldn't have felt forgotten. After 14 minutes we finally met our waitress who asked us if we needed more time to review the menu. Really We counted 3 parties, thats it...in a otherwise bare restaurant. Food was good, received it pretty quickly. Our drinks were refilled often without being asked. First impressions really do matter. It wouldn't have mattered from that point if service was perfect. Don't ignore someone intentionally when they obviously know you can see them. From reading other reviews it seems that we aren't the only ones who experienced the same issues. Really felt like we were being intentionally ignored. We did something we  have never done. Intentionally left without leaving a tip. The one person who was polite happened to be the person who was in the next room cleaning. Kinda ironic since she doesn't assist the people actually dining. Will not be back.

"We just received the worst service ever I will never come back. Its shocking that on wing special night it was merly 6 tables. One person actually went to the back to fix their own drinks. We had To ask for everything numerous of times. Service was very slow ass and the management was not customer friendly. I personally was not thinking to take pictures of all the screw ups due to all of the complaints the whole table was making. I hated to make so many complaints but I've never experienced such horrible service. It was awful We couldn't find any positive in it. As a matter of fact the waitress didn't even come back to pick up all the checks. It Was 7 of us and 6 ppl got their checks. We told the management We needed to pay another check and that We didn't know why the waitress would leave one out, his response was unprofessional.  :(

"I don't know who of my group picked this place out, but they never owned up to it. The service was absolutely terrible.  The waitress was practically all but ignoring us.  We only got offered one round of drinks, never asked if we wanted a second round.  We had to ask for our silverwarenapkins after our food came, and did not get it until at least 10 minutes later about halfway through the meal. All the while watching the group of guys next to us get service repeatedly (when they asked her to get something, she would immediately come back to their table, not disappear for 10 minutes then have to be asked again when she did finally return). Aside from just being terrible, she was also unfriendly.  As for the food, all my friends seemed to enjoyappreciate their meals.  For about 8-10$, you get a huge sandwichburger and a side of fries.  Except $8 for a basket of chip and cheese dip is ridiculously overpriced to me.As a vegetarian, it was entirely another matter for me.  Not wanting a ""veggie"" burger, I ordered the buffalo blue cheese dip + potato wedgeschips + vegetables off the appetizer menu.  What was delivered was a basket of chips and cheese dip. When I asked the waitress if I was correct that the menu listed vegetables as well, she said ""yeah, it should come with it"" as if I was asking too much for the kitchen to produce what the menu says.  It wasn't actually until I explained the vegetable part was the reason I ordered this dish that she ""offered"" to get them for me.  She disappears. Ten minutes later, my friends halfway through their meal, no vegetables in sight, but at least we have silverware and napkins now.  Five minutes later, she hears us loudly complaining, and says shes told the kitchen twice now.. yeah right. Another ten minutes later, we're complaining real loud now, to ourselves because no staff member is in sight.  Soon the manager appears and says the vegetables will be out soon and apologizes.  My cheese dip and potato chips are not semi-warm, at best. He returns, and in a pretentiously apologetic manner sets done a plate and gets ready to scurry off before I can complain about: THREE 6-inch cuts of celery, and TWO 4-inch by 1-inch hunks of a carrot, completely RAW.  It took them 25 minutes to bring this out to me, and then act as if this would suffice without any compensation.  We immediately asked for a box and a discount. Yes, he discounted us 10% of our final bill, which I think came out to deducting my cheese dip and chips, plus half of my beer.  The waitress brought it out as one check too, not asking if us 2 men and 2 women (obviously 2 couples), would have wanted the check split.The kicker: the sidewalk sign outside their door read ""Charlotte's Finest"" ... Methinks not.

"Slow service I can handle (took about 20 mintues to get two glasses of water) and we were there over an hour and a half (during a slow time) to get two cheesesteaks.  Average food, expected, just looking for something quick and close.  The icing on the cake was when the waitress lost my credit card.  Now I realize this could easily happen, however she didn't bother to tell me that she lost it.  Finally after her being gone 20 minutes with my card, we found her and asked her what the delay was, to which she responded ""did I by chance give you back your credit card""  My first thought was TELL ME RIGHT AWAY SO I CAN CALL THE BANK!!!!!!!  I told her that and her response was ""I know, but I was so embarrassed.""  Luckily, they found our card eventually, but if someone else had found it, they could do a lot of damage in 20 minutes with all the shops around there.As a side note, during our LONG HORRIBLE experience, two other groups came in and left after about 20 minutes of not even having a waiterwaitress say boo to them.  I wish we had seen their experiences before we ordered.I wish 0 stars was an option, I would have chosen it!

"We were staying at the hotel it's located in (The Marriott) and we couldn't go anywhere because it was raining. Horrible experience.First we got in and had to search for a table. Once we found one (which was dirty) we waited about 10 minutes for the server to clean it. Once we finally sat, she took our drink orders and came back soon after for our dinner orders. I asked which was her favorite from the sandwhiches and she said the philly. LIAR!Besides the fact that it took 45 MIN, yes 45 for us to get out food, when the food got there it was all really shitty. The meat inside my philly was burnt to a crisp along with the cheese which was so burnt, parts of it were black. The bread was cold and hard. Fries were ok. By this point, we were so hungry, we just ate. After we were sitting with our plates in front of us for about 20 min, I decided to get up and go get the checks myself. She gave them to me and I walked them to my table myself, took the credit cards myself and gave them to her. We had to go, it was getting way too late.Granted, it was St. Patricks day and the place was packed, but when that happens, you need to ask for help.

"Went in for a couple drinks and food. It was so slow that I actually asked one of the employees if they were closing. With that being said, drinks came out pretty fast but that was it... waited about 15 minutes for the bartender to take our order which we cashed out and moved on to another place to eat. There were more employees in the restaurant than guests, and ironically there were a couple of them enjoying a meal, at a table in the Dining room, in front of customers who couldn't even order an appetizer in a reasonable time. No management present that we could see. Seems like a place that has given up.

"I used to like this place, but then I tried paying for a small item with my debit card at a bead store, and was told I needed to buy a minimum of 10$ if I were to buy anything from them. I was told the same thing from the guy selling knives and also the lady selling Avon. that would have been 30$ I was charged for 5$ worth of trinkets. When I brought up this usery at their website to correct, they told me to shop somewhere else.(what a bunch of jerks!) So, I told them I would make sure to get the word out to whomever would listen to 'not waste your time there.' Besides, in the wintertime all they sell is the same thing row after row anyways. In the summertime it is overpriced and not worth the trip to drive out there. The mall is much more affordable. Ironic isn't it

"SUPER SUPER disappointed ! I drove over 30 minutes yesterday to get there only to find they closed 10 minutes early, i showed a guy named Keith my I phone that read 5:50 and all he could say was he goes by their clock. This guy Keith has been rude to me in the past but I keep going back because I love the great stuff there, In fact I have to go back today :( to get what I wanted yesterday. Keith told me the owners name was Michael, but I can't seem to find him or his email address.

"Place is pretty big with no vendors.  Alot of spaces are open and the building has horrible smell filling the air, almost like a combo of body odor and century old clothes.  I was here to get info on vendorrenting space but there is absolutely no shoppers and experience was awful.  I am get the idea that building ownersmanagement of the swap meet must be pretty bad with all the spaces open and no renters.  My personal first time experience...while walking up to the office to get info  I witnessed something that no shopper or person should have to go through.  So There was middle eastern lady that was working or managing in the office yelling horrible things at a shopper who lost a child about how horrible a person she was and that she was not going to take her child until the police arrived. Whoa! Little kid was ok and mother was in tears!  I totally felt bad for the mother because we all have had that horrible experience of losing a kid in non familiar place and just want to comfort your child.  I was almost about to say something but totally shocked when security with turbans  started harassing the whole family all the way out of the building.  PRETTY TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE AND WILL NOT GO BACK TO SHOP OR SELL WHATSOEVER!  i am sure that poor family won't be returning either and must I say DON'T LOOSE YOUR CHILD THERE. GEESH!

"The place had this awful smell to it, wasn't sure what it was but smelled something like dirty clothes that have been wet a few day. The prices are high at most the vendors stands that I went to. There is no food that I seen so if your hungry this isn't the place to come. Once you smell the inside you will most likely lose your appetite anyway. The management is rude, and dont speak much english or any spanish. When asked a question they simply ignore you or say the don't understand. I will not be returning, because there was nothing that was of any use to me. I will stick to the Arizona Mills good prices and AC, something the indoor swap meet didn't have running.

"I was very disappointed....rude employees pushed service away.  I had prepared an anniversary date for my husband and I. I had called in asking if I needed to make an appt. or reservation and they told me no just come in, so we went to dinner first and arrived at this place at 8:10, they close at 9 and take their last sitting at 8:15. Their ""open"" sign was already off, I walked in and no one was at the front, you can tell they were cleaning up, so I asked if my husband and I could come in and she said no sorry we are closing, I was looking at the clock and she said yeah we take our last people at 8:15 well it was only 8:10 so we had 5 mins right Nope she was completely rude and made me walk out. I was so bummed because our awesome date I had plan was cut short. I will be finding another place to go and hope that the owners or managers will find new employees, because it is a cute place.

"I walked in with all the intentions of painting a piece. I knew exactly the quote colors and kind of oiece I wanted. I just needed help getting it altogether. The girl working was so rude and unhelpful. She didn't try to help me find a piece and she walked away and went back to cleaning and stocking and then was on the phone with a personal call. So I walked out and will never return. Such a cute and seemingly fun place, but the employees need to be nicer and trained better. Such a shame.

"We try to support local business but in this case it backfired. Took a pretty basic framing job to artarama and spent a good amount of time providing instructions. When it came time to pick it up, it was not ready. In fact they finally delivered it a week after they committed. But that was only the first problem...despite all of the instructions the matting was done incorrectly with a wrong color and a wrong style. Now back at square one. I would not recommend Jerrys Artarama if you want quality and value your time.

"Even though I asked several employees in the store, not one would help beyond pointing to a wall. I came to the store with a list and left with nothing. El lardo at the cash register couldn't be bothered though I think I might have been one of two customers there. He was busy shoving what looked to be Chicharrones into his pie hole. I left and drove over to AZ Art Supply next to Sprouts on Southern. AZ Art Supply showed me where everything was and I left within 15 minutes with $110 worth of supplies.

"After visiting the Brush Bar our standard on painting and wine drinking were set high. The Art of Merlot lacks character, enthusiasms, and creativity. With no guidance you are left on your own recreating a complicated painting. For $45 you get a $3 canvas and a couple dollars worth of paint and you're expected to bring your own wine. The staff was nice enough but lacked enthusiasm and guidance that the Brush Bar had. Needless to say I would always choose the Brush Bar for a night of art and wine.

"This was a huge disappointment. I have been wanting to go here for months and last night my gf and I went and it was not good at all. The girl teaching the class did nooooooooo teaching or explaining. The entire time she kept saying it was imaginative. We came to learn not to throw paint on a canvas that looks like a mess. I could have done that at home for less money. The teacher barely spoke. She just painted while the rest of the class talked. Worst $45 I have ever spent. Will never go back unless I want to waste my money. It's said because this is my first ever review on yelp and hate that it's a negative one. But the girl even had the adasity to ask for tips....what She did nothing. I have been to other places in town and have loved them, stinks that I can't add this one to my list of rotation.

"This is a bar trying to be more. The small plates were heavy and riffs on burgers and fries. The beer selection is what you would find at Harris Teeters and is marked up. Go to Gallery 22 if you want an amazing selection of beer, better prices, and a true tapas restaurant upstairs.

"Awful service; took us 2 and a half hours to get our food and the waiter forgot several items (then added a few beers we didn't order on to our tab; I'm assuming because he thought we were too drunk to notice.) Then we find out that after we had nicely split the tab for them (even adding in an extra $10 on top of the grat because we were too lazy to re-do the math) that they wouldn't split the check In the time we argued about it, you could have run the 3 credit cards we had and been done with it.Had to argue with the manager (who was completely unhelpful, with one of the waiters standing behind her and being rude to me for backup) for 10 minutes and they didn't give us an inch. I would have stiffed the waiter for the awful service if I could have; but we got gratted so I didn't even have that option.If you want to come here with more than 3 people, avoid D's. Their beer is severely overpriced ($10 for a beer I can get at Sharp Edge for $6 no thanks!) and the food is the same fried garbage covered in cheese you can get at any other bar in Pittsburgh.In other words, don't come here. I used to like this place, but tonight was such a bad experience I'll just go to one of the other places in Pittsburgh that serves hot dogs, french fries and beer. There are plenty of them, I won't miss D's at all.

"I tried to go here for the second time today.  I say tried because I sat at the bar for about 7 mins with 3 people walking around behind it and no one even acknowledging I was there.  I ended up going next door to The Map Room for lunch.The first time I had gone I had a server come and take my order, a kitchen guy ran it out, and then no one ever came back for 45 mins.  I went to the counter for my check and thought that I wouldn't give it another go.  Well, you can't say I didn't try. I had the barbeque chicken pizza the first time and it wasn't bad, but its not a place I'd make my go to pizza place.

"Every time I come here, hoping, just hoping that I'm going to have a couple delicious hotdogs. Raw. Unfiltered. Old school. Like a ballpark from the 1920's or something.But each time I come away disappointed, even more than last time.My father worked here three or four decades ago. I'd love to love this place and recommend it to my friends.The service is anywhere from good to great, and they are fast and friendly!And maybe, just maybe, I come when the hotdogs have been sitting on the grill too long. At odd hours. or an hour after the rush.Every time, the hotdogs (and brats) are harder than a rock.  Not a snappy casing, no, this is like barely edible hard exterior.So what's a man to do Try again  Sadly, I'll probably forget about my recent experiences, and try them again.I just hope they are fresher next time, because I can't imagine them worse than today.

"I almost hate writing this review, because Green's is such a Charlotte institution. I almost feel like I'm dissing my adopted city by saying this, but I just don't see what the big deal is about this place. When I first moved here everyone talked about how the hot dogs were as good as The Varsity in Atlanta. News tip: they aren't, and they aren't by a longshot. What's worse, the three or four times I've eaten there the food has been lukewarm and inconsistent. Maybe the hot dog is cold, but the chili is hot. I dunno... I WANT to like this place, but just can't.

"Little confused here.. tried to get a hot dog from the cart outside the Fargo last week, when the lady saw me coming (she was on her cell phone) she hid behind the grill and didn't address me, so I walked away and went to another dog stand... is this the way they normally do business with the hot dog cart
",0
"This is one of those places where the hype is bigger than reality.  Sure, it's an institution of a business that somehow survived the times without changing the decor for decades.  But the hot dogs aren't impressive at all, I was actually quite disappointed by them.  In my order, I got two Carolina Style Dogs (mustard, onions, slaw and chili), with fries and a drink.  The drink is inundated with tons of ice, which quickly waters down any flavor the soda may have had.  The fries were so-so, nothing fancy about crinkle-cut.  The dogs were disappointing... since the hot dogs are cooked in a water pot, they should be dried off a little before putting in the bun; well, they didn't do that and I had a soggy buns as a result.  The slaw and chili didn't have any real flavor to them and probably would have been better without because of the mess.  Overall, I couldn't finish both dogs because it got too messy and tasted blah with the wet bun.Honestly, I have had better hot dogs from the Green's lunch cart located in front of Wells Fargo than the actual location.  Prices are the same, cheap, and that lady doesn't mess around with soggy buns.  If you want Green's lunch, go to the cart, not the establishment.  Overall, there are better hot dog places in Uptown, though will cost more.

"Don't know what the deal was, but on a day with a car show across the street and a basketball game a couple blocks away we were one of about 3 parties which rolled up for lunch only to find the place closed. Who knows how many folks did the same thing considering the posted Saturday hours. Then again about half of Uptown was closed. CLT remains at heart a town by, for, and of bankers. Sad.

"This place sucks!! I am from Chicago just recently sentenced to the valley, but I will tell you what, the food at this place is as authentic as a three dollar bill!! I mean they were rude, unfriendly, and their food reflected there attitude..it sucked! Owners let me tell you something just because you order a sign that say's ""Chicago style"" and hang it outside doesn't mean that it is and you may be able to trick your Phoenix natives but true chicago folk should know the difference. The reality is that if you were on Clark st. Competing for business you'd last about 10 minutes before you went dark. Your food is bland and nasty. Your employees seem like extras from the movie ""coma"" and look like they could use an FMLA day, and your place is unkempt and dirty. I pray that a white castle opens nearby and steals your handful of customers, it would not be hard. Next time I will take video of the place and the food as well as the staff and their attitude and post it on you tube for those who have any doubt.

"Ah man!  I was so embarrassed when a delivery was made by this establishment to my boyfriend's Mom.  So, I ordered a $65 arrangement (NOT including the $18 delivery charge) via Teleflora (A Rose Shack is one of their subcontractors), and it was an embarrassment what they sent.  Also, the order was supposed to come with a Lenox bowl which was why I chose the arrangement.  Did they send the arrangement with a Lenox bowl  Nope!  Did they notify me that they were going to send an awful replacement Nope!  So disappointing.  Got my money back through Teleflora, went to Whole Foods off the strip and bought a much more attractive arrangement for the fraction of the price ($45) and delivered it myself!  Perhaps there was a miscommunication between A Rose Shack and Teleflora, and they aren't completely to blame... I don't know... I don't recommend them - my personal experience was really bad.

However this was not meant to be. 130 dollars later and Thursday she's already throwing some out. I've ordered before and got nice flowers. I don't know why it's so inconsistent, but I'm done.

"Very unaccomodating and expensive!  If your kids cannot make it to camp one day of the week, they will not allow a makeup day and the price stays the same.  They charge a ""late fee"" if you want to come the same day, and don't seem to care whether they turn away new clients or customers because they are more interested in money.  Gold Metal Gymnastics in Chandler, although a bit further, is a better option.  They are friendly, kind, and know that with children and our lives, things don't always work out exactly as we want.  Save your money and go to another camp that cares about families and kids, and not about nickel and diming you.

"I went to the Sunday night Salsa lessons at Paragon. There were about 200 people for the salsa group lessons. It was a noisy zoo. Men far outnumbered women, but during the course of the lesson it almost evened out. Lot's of partner switching -- in fact switching is almost all we did. That has it's advantages if your main goal is to hold hands with lots of partners. I have certainly heard a lot of hype about Paragon but the studio left me kind of cold. I don't see how anybody could learn to dance there. The quality of instruction isn't close to other local studios I have been to. Of course maybe the instruction was better than I knew since it was almost impossible to see or hear the instructor and individual attention is out of the question. I gave them another try on a Thursday for a West Coast Swing lesson. The quality of instruction wasn't good, and we had distractions because other group lessons and privates were given in the same ballroom. They have other small ballrooms so there was little excuse to cram everybody into the main ballroom. I watched a private lesson and wasn't impressed by what I saw. Paragon is probably popular because of the dances after the lessons but the music wasn't for beginners. So, if you want to learn dancing go somewhere else, for meat markets do Paragon. Their prices and quality will appeal to anyone who thinks McDonald's is a great deal.

"I joined Fred Astaire in 2003 and went for as long as I could afford it.This dance studio is all about high pressure sales. I noticed that they really work on the lonely; widowers, divorcees, etc. They make you feel like you are part of their family and when you run out of money, drop you like a hot potato. I didn't even finish my last few lessons because of the hotcold nonsense. Everything is very expensive and I know of other customers who went through their life savings just to stay a part of this group because they were lonely. It is very sad that people can earn their living taking advantage of others.The dance instructors are very talented so I gave one star.

"To keep it short and sweet: Save yourself $100. Buy a good board game, your alcohol of choice, order a pizza, and invite your friends over. What an incredible disappointment. After seeing the enticing commercials so many times, we decided to give this place a try on a double date. I understand the prices of the play cards and won't dispute them; however, the food was incredibly over-priced, came out COLD (as in, sat on a counter without warmers for a minimum of 30 minutes) and I literally had to ask the bartender if there was any vodka in my drink. It was pure juice. $38 for three shots that had little-no alcohol in them. (Not to mention, my glass was dirty, and I saw the bartender scoop the glass into the ice basin because she was too lazy to use the sanitary scoop. I know the Food and Beverage Commission would be as disappointed as I was.) The service was terrible. Don't ask for anything from your waiter, as they are a little too busy on their cell phones or conversing amongst themselves. Was it fun to be in an adult-themed arcade Yes. If you're looking for a good atmosphere to go with friends to play games, I suppose I would advise you give it a shot. I would never recommend their food, customer service, or drinks. Save yourself the money and stay home, or go for a traditional bowling, figure skating, roller-blading, rock climbing, basically any other physically-entertaining themed date instead.

"I was here on 103 and I have to say this was a horrible experience.  Me and a friend went here to eat and play a couple games afterwards.  It took the waitress at least 10-15 minutes to greet us and by that time we knew we should just order then because we might not see her again.  We ordered and got our drinks and well let's just say we didn't see the waitress again until she was giving us our check (some manager delivered the food to the table).  No refill on my beverage, no how is your food, no ketchup for my burger or fries was offered.  Lots of people running around like crazy and if your understaffed hire more people!  I will not be back again to eat.

"How to put this gentlyWhile I may go back to Pittsburgh some day, I will never return to the Carnegie Museum of Art. It's not that I mind that its gallery seemed small compared to others I have viewed (sometimes small museums have some hidden treasures) or that one whole gallery was blown glass and I felt like I was at a bong shop on haight st. in sf. It comes down to the fact that a docent, while trying to explain a painting with a watchtower in it, told the students it was a watchtower ""from Auschwitz, a place where they basically fried a lot of Jews"".  Seriously That's how she chose to describe concentration camps to a large class of what I could only guess were middle schoolers It sounded like she described a bad breakfast joint...""oh that place they basically just fry eggs"".On top of all that, the description of the piece stated the watchtower was reminiscent of those that were spread throughout East and West Germany during Hitler's rule (i.e. not those in Auschwitz).In sum, docents are a reflection of the institution in which they volunteer, and this one sucked. So, Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, if you're going to hire racist people to lead your tours, at least make sure they have their facts straight (or can read).

I live probably 30 minutes from the museum and could have driven there 63838484848485858 times by now and picked it up. Its just sooo unprofessional and annoying. They need to get their office together and deliver refunds in a timely manner. 7-10 business days are fine but 3 WEEKS is UNACCEPTABLE for it to not have even been MAILED YET. So dissapointed and will never use them again.

"Ugh!  Another losing season.  WTF man, weren't we in first place at the All-Star Break  What happened  I wasn't expecting a World Series Champ or even a Pennant winner.  But was a winning season too much to ask for  This marks the 20th anniversary since the Pirates' last winning season.  That's right folks--it's been since 1992.  Let's take a look at the world of 1992.BASEBALL:  The Pirates' roster that year included Stan Belinda, Doug Drabek, Zane Smith, Denny Neagle, Jay Bell, Orlando Merced, Andy Van Slyke, and of course Barry Bonds.  All have since retired.  The only new ballparks were New Comiskey Park (now U.S. Cellular Field) and Camden Yards.  No stadiums had corporate names.  The Arizona Diamondbacks, the Colorado Rockies, the Miami Marlins, and the Tampa Bay (Devil) Rays didn't exist.  The Washington Nationals were the Montreal Expos.  The Milwaukee Brewers were in the AL.  Both the NL and the AL only had two divisions each.  The minor league Washington Wild Things didn't exist either and nor did their league.  KBL was the big cable sports channel.TV:  ""Saturday NIght Live's"" cast included Dana Carvey, Ellen Cleghorne, Chris Farley, Tim Meadows, Mike Myers, Kevin Nealon, Phil Hartman,  Chris Rock, Adam Sandler, Rob Schneider, and David Spade.  ""Seinfeld"" hadn't become a huge hit yet and no one knew Kramer's first name.

You also used pay phones because you didn't have a cell phone.  You watched movies on a VCR.  You met up with your friends without texting them.  You ordered merchandise by ""sending in"" or by calling an ""800"" number.  You had to buy tickets by waiting in line.  And OJ Simpson was still a football hero.So that's it, Pittsburgh Pirates.  I feel like telling you I'm done with you guys.  I'm no fair weather fan, but 20+ years of losing is enough.

"After reading all the reviews here about C-Fu Gourmet being the best place for dim sum in the valley, I am really disappointed to be writing my first 1 star review for the areaWas the service rude and uncaring The answer here is yes.  Especially the way that push-cart servers call out the food which make you feel like you're in a rowdy tourist market full of cheap knock-offs they're trying to get rid of.  But all would have been forgiven if only the dim-sum being served was any good.  However the dishes we ordered reflected a sloppy kitchen that was focused solely on putting in minimal effort and taking every possible shortcut on the food. Dishes that made me ashamed to be Chinese (yes, the level that C-Fu dimsum brought it down to was that bad):-  Fried glutinous rice:  The preserved meat that was supposed to flavor the dish was MIA. We complained to one of the waiters who replied that ""they probably forgot"" (um are you sure it's not cost cutting for those who don't know any better).  More over, the proper way to cook this classic dish would be like risotto where you're constantly stirring and gradually adding water just a little bit at a time (except of course everything is being done in a wok)...Here the C-Fu kitchen obviously just shoved the whole thing into an electric rice-cooker and try to stir fry the huge sticky mess at the end by adding in gallons of oil.   -  Glutinous rice with chicken steamed in lotus leaf:  Once again that electric rice cooker in the back of the kitchen must be working real hard cause the dish lacked the aroma that it would have had if it had actually been steamed in lotus leaf.  Just tasted of sloppy topping of minced chicken and last minute wrapping in the lotus leaf.Dishes I was amazed by (and no not in a good way):-  Deep fried taro dumpling:  Have never quite had it in that simplistic way before where the filling literally was just mashed taro held together by a prodigious amount of oil-  Steamed bok choy:  How the heck do you get oil into steamed vegetable  C-Fu managed to accomplish this amazing feat of greasy steamed vegetable...unbelievableOn a good note, the Siu Mai was decent.  We did keep on ordering more dishes hopping that something good would pop up...but nope that was it,...so if  you must go to C-Fu for dim-sum...just order order a lot of siu mai and be careful of all the other dishes.  Dinner here was much better. 1 star is for dim-sum only.Next time I have a dim-sum craving, you'll be finding me across the valley at China Chan's (Glendale) where the short & sweet dimsum offering is cooked by a man who doesn't cut corners and it shows.  That's where I'll be sticking to from now on.

"hilarious! where did the screaming yellow  ""....we reserve the right to add 15% gratuity to your bill....."" signs go  aka we know the service and dimsum sux, so we'll try and make money another way.  best dimsum in phoenix (pretty low standards for a desert community i guess)  luckily there's plenty of competition now in the east valley (hint: go 1 mi east, 1 mile  south) NW corner, get there before 11am on weekends or stand in line with the rest of the other asians.

"This place is used to be my favorite Dim Sum restaurant, but I have not visited them for a while. It's not because of their foods. Their foods is good and service is OK. It's their sneaky behavior at the register that bothers me. I don't know if they are still doing the same thing, but I just got pissed of once for all. Here is the story. I was at the cashier desk to pay my bill. The lady at the counter did not know I can understand Cantonese. So the lady told customer, who is a friend of her, that the 15% tips is already included in the credit card receipt as total. So there is no need to put tips in the blank tip line. What a shocking finding. If you don't calculate your total bill, you may be paying double tips! What a shame on them. I don't mind to pay 20% tips, but they should told their customer that the total number on your receipt already includes tips!I have not visited the restaurant since!

"This place is so awful that I don't even want to spend too much time writing this review.Food is mediocre, service was extremely rude, my catering order was never filled and when I called to confirm the order one hour prior to pickup they just simply told me they didn't make it and wasn't planning on doing it...huh  I once found a cooked cockroach in my dim sum dish...that was it...would never ever go back.

"I came here for dimsum with a few friends during lunch. The quality of the food is mediocre compared the legit ones in Hacienta Heights, CA or San Gabriel, CA. My friend and I are hardcore dimsum fans, so we have been to this dimsum a few times, until we decided to change to the one across the street called Phoenix Palace Buffet. For some reason, we returned back to C-Fu to try it again, but the service was horrible!! We requested water and tea, and in my water cup and all around it were white residue from a previous mixed drink of another customer. I had already drank half of the iced water and realized there was all over the sides of the cup. I immediately asked for a replacement and even the server was grossed out! They did not do anything to compensate for such a gross encounter, which in the end made everyone at the table lose our appetites. Seriously... traumatized. Definitely not coming back until their service improves!

"I decided to check this place out after having driven by it numerous times and had a few friend say that they liked the place a fair deal.  I was hungry and craving chinese, so why not I figured.Called in to see if they were open and they were, but hearing that they had an hour wait, I elected to carry out.  15-20 minutes is about average so I didn't say boo.  25 minute prep time isn't too far outside of the estimate and they were busy after all.The barbecue pork lo-mein was not the best ever.  Pork had a fatty texture, and the dish as a whole was okay though a bit bland.  The duck won ton soup was pretty good....Right until I got to the meat.  Almost every piece had either bones or bone chips in it.  I am not sure if that is a normal part of how it's made, but I have never experienced the like before and it was a put off.The experience over the phone and waiting was fair.  The place was packed due to being one of the rare places open Christmas night  and I understand the pressure of being a host or hostess in this situation, but I saw this girl loose her composure a few times in the 15 minutes I was there, once pretty majorly.With the bones, fatty flavor and other worries, I managed a few bites overall before my $20 meal went into the garbage disposal or trash.  I'm stunned with the overwhelming good reviews, as my experience was so weak as I had pretty much a poor experience overall and a lot of disappointment.I may or may not give them another shot in the future.  At the moment, I doubt it.

"EW don't ever eat dim sum over here.  Food was not fresh at all! I wouldn't be surprised if they just microwave leftovers from the previous day and serve them all over again. Their shrimp balls tasted like poop balls.... okay, so maybe I'm over-exaggerating a little but you get the idea. It actually tasted like effing plastic... EWWWWWA.I say, go right over to Phoenix Palace Buffet across the street and get yourself some edible dim sum. YOU CAN THANK ME LATER! :)

"Avoid on weekdays if you want Dim Sum!The last two times I went there I left after sitting at a table for 20 minutes with no food. Sometimes a cart would go by - a different table.  No amount of hand waving or imploring looks would do any good.You couldn't drag me in there kicking and screaming on a weekday again.

"we used to come to this place a lot when we were still living in Vegas.  We were on vacation in Vegas recently and figured, ""let's visit our old stomping restaurant.""  We were greeted and paid first (new policy) I guess there were a lot of people that just gets up from their table and pretends to be using the restroom but actually leaving. Anyways, not a big deal...My hubby goes and gets some rice and what did he find in there HAIR...he told one of the workers and the worker quickly took the pot and said thank you.  So, it's a good thing that she acknowledged.  Ok, so we thought it was over.  I go up to their fresh vegetable stir-fry area where the guy does it in front of you.  I picked my veggies (bean sprouts etc...) and shrimp and handed it to him...went and grabbed some of the food and headed back to him to pick up my stir-fried veggies and headed back to my table to enjoy this food.  I have been craving for this veggies all day...I'm about to dig in and what do I find HAIR!!! AGAIN!!!  Is it booby trap day for us  I took it to the guy and he said it's from the bean sprouts...I said no, it's not and I actually picked it up with my fork and showed him.  He didn't apologize but asks me if I wanted another one...I don't think so! After all this happened, we kind of lost our appetite but we paid $50 for our freaking dinner!  So we were just careful of what we were putting in our mouth, sigh...  While we were having dinner, my son had to go to restroom so hubby took him. While they were in there, one of the workers came in to use the restroom, he went pee, and blew his nose in his hands and just rinsed his finger tips off and left...that is freaking GROSS!!!!!  By this time we've had it...so we just left...Never ever coming back to this place again...

"I can't quite understand why so many people like Buffet at Asia. My wife and I tried the Rainbow location a year or so ago and it was absolutely revolting. The serving areas were messy, the food overly greasy and unappealing and it all just felt extremely cheap and low-end.Perhaps I am picky because I come from Australia where we can get amazing Chinese food (sort of like how in the US you can get great Mexican due to the proximity to Mexico). The fact that I don't eat fish or seafood of any kind didn't help either - The place was VERY heavy on the seafood.  Vegetarians won't he happy either, unless you are one of those fake ""vegetarians"" that thinks fish are vegetables.The final nail in the coffin for us about this place where the signs on the walls saying that due to wastage, if you left any food on your plate you would be CHARGED EXTRA FOR IT! I mean -really- part of the beauty of a buffet is that you get to OWN the food and decide what to eat. I don't want to have to clean up my plate for fear of trouble with the management. I'd be interested to know if this ludicrous policy is still in place, but I have no desire to ever eat here again and will never know.

"Simply put, if you can't afford to eat at nice buffet and wish to enjoy crab, this is the place. Othewise skip this place since the crab tasted like mash potatos and all though they don't run out of food, the customers grab all they can get as soon as they bring the crab or lobster out.Food tasted like 2nd or 3rd day left overs and hate to say it. I tend to give great reviews to places that I enjoy and this is not one of them. My friend that took me there keep telling me that the food is great for the price and I was thinking well I guess if you are hungry enough, you can eat out of garbage cans and the cost would be great also.I would not return to this place to eat because I rather eat white rice by itself then the food they serve.Sorry for the bad review, I'm sure there are tons of people that enjoy the value but once you know what food supposed to taste like, it's hard to go back to this type of buffet.

"This place is just ""okay"". My dad loves this place.. Or used to love it. Honestly, the only reason why I go to this place is because of their shrimp and mussels. Oh! And their free refills of Thai Iced Tea. That's it. It's good. But everything else is.. Pure nasty-ness. Unless, of course, you're into the taste of shit.Anyway, I hate their servers here with a passion. Especially the hostess. The last and final time my family and I were there, we brought in fam members from New York. So in total there were around NINE of us. The hostess wanted us to fit in ONE booth. ONE freaking booth. How do you expect all nine of us to fit into ONE BOOTH! When we kindly asked if we could have at least two, she rolled her eyes at us, gave us attitude and finally gave in after arguing with my dad. My dad, of course, went to go complain at the front. She started arguing with my dad and finally my dad gave in and yelled, ""SHUT UP! I'M THE CUSTOMER AND YOU'RE NOT!"" Dumb hoe finally shut her mouth. There are plenty of events like this in the past. I swear, I've never came across such rude and disrespectful people in my whole entire life. They're also pretty slow on refills. Just a FYI.

I thought I was going to break a tooth eating their orange chicken! Then i tried their beef and broccoli thinking it would be better because it wasn't dry wrong again ewww so nasty, fried rice and crab rangoons were also disappointing! I would never eat here again!

"Negative stars for this place!!! This use to be one of mine and best friend's spot to eat. On one of our regular trips (we love the crab legs...) needless to say, the eyeball on my crab was still there looking at me and my friend found what looked to be a nose hair in her won ton soup. We both left in a hurry and made sure no one saw us because we still had full plates of food and were afraid to be charged extra. We proceeded to throw up in front of the restaurant. NEVER AGAIN. We are very sadden by the fact that one of our favorite spots is RUINED for us.

"I've been to this buffet for years, I pretty much grew up eating here. This place definitely deserves its 3 stars; however I just had the worst experience after years of eating here. I'm not entirely sure if the management has changed throughout the years, but whoever hired these waiters and the grill master must not have taken their applications seriously. My first bad experience happened the second I was seated. The waiter rolled his eyes at my party members for taking a little while on deciding what they wanted to drink. He was paying so little attention to us that he even got 2 out of 6 drinks wrong.Second, I remembered how much I used to love making my own Mongolian barbeque because of how friendly the old grill master used to be... however, not quite this time. I had to call him twice just to get his attention and he definitely ignored me both times because after the third time I asked him to make my order spicy, he told me to go and grab the sauce myself. Sorry grill master, but no tip for you this time.Lastly, the same waiter that made a fuss about getting my drinks was taking my plates away. This time, this guy manages to spill all the pot sticker sauce all over my table and on my girlfriend's seat while she was gone. The guy never apologized and just simply up and left our table in a mess.Needless to say I didn't tip these bastards one cent for their horrid service. I would've been better off getting my own drink and making my own barbeque. Like I said, this place probably deserves its 3 stars from years of eating here, but never again will I be visiting Buffet  Asia.

"Before i used to believe 'Bad Dim Sum' was an old wives tale ment to scare children from the greasy steamed dishes of utter OMGWTFBBQPWNAGE-ness!!! Thank you Cathay House for industrializing dim sum and making it as chinese as taco bell is to mexican food.Lately in my review I've been doing a breakdown of everything from how the place looks to me to listing what i ordered and what i thought of it. I'd rather not for this review because it would force me to stop, lean over, and vomit uncontrollably. Gripes- They sat us in what i call the 'shit hole' section of the restaurant where small families, less then a few people and generally those who don't look like they're gonna spend a lot of money go to minimize chances of customers wasting their time and maximize profit. Guess where the white people sat- same cart, different pusher to give the illusion they were well stocked- you could taste how much effort they put into their food. i've had chicken mcnuggets that have had more effort put into them-oh look another cart that means they got more selection..DAMN IT those two just traded...DAMN YOU!!!!!ConclusionIf you feel like Dim Sum go somewhere elseIf you feel like eating what chinese people make to sell to foreigners by all means go here and order an Egg Foo Young and General Tso's Chicken and taste that authentic chinese goodness

"I frequent 2 other dim sum restaurants in Las Vegas and decided to give Cathay House a try yesterday because they had zagat stickers on their door. The food was absolutely horrible overall. I was with 4 other people and no one had a good experience. A lot of the dishes were cold and some looked and tasted like they were reheated leftovers from another day. The egg custard tasted like old frying oil was used to make it and completely unedible. When we told the manager how bad the egg custard was, he didn't even apologize. He even acted annoyed that we said anything. I would NEVER go back there again. Orchid Garden and Chang's have much better food and service.

"Omg this place is HORRID! I've never even reviewed a place so low before! I'm really disappointed Vegas!So this has got to be the worst Dim Sum restaurant I've been too. With food and service. Usually service is horrible at dim sum, because its dim sum. They feel the need that they don't need to check up on you, because they have the little ladies with carts going around, and around serving you what you choose. Which isn't that bad.But this place... As soon as we got seated, they brought out our water in PLASTIC disposable cups, when everyone else had regular re- used washable cups. How do you run out of cups Very classy for a ""nice"" restaurant. And we had also got tea, chrysanthemum tea. As I poured it into my tea cup, I looked in and saw that a bug came out of the pot! It was disgusting! We couldn't even get anyones attention to change it out. Or for them to take it away.Also, our Soy Sauce bottle was empty!! They didn't even notice to give us a new one, we had to switch it out with the table next to us.And at last,, the food. It was COLD. Dim sum is suppose to be hot. Steaming hot. But it was so cold, it was breaking apart. Horrible I tell you.

"I hate to give bad reviews but this place was definitely NOT GOOD.The food here wasn't very flavorful and I'm not super picky on flavor. The chicken looked and tasted like it maybe wasn't chicken... There was a fish tank full of dead fish on display for the diners to see, gross. There's millions of places to get Chinese food in Chinatown so I would not recommend this one. Also I got sick to my stomach almost instantly after we finished eating. I usually prefer food that doesn't make me sick.

"Absolute worst service I've ever had, and I've been to a lot of Chinese restaurants. All the other times I've been here, nothing worth mentioning, but the most recent time will be my last time.Now I don't know who all the titles of the staff, so I'll just refer to them as waiters and busers. I think we had 2 servers and 2-3 busers throughout the course of our meal.2-3 because I think I saw two busers that looks identical, and I'm not being racist because I'm Chinese myself, so I'll just count them both as one person.We first get there and put in our order. I didn't keep track of time, but probably after 20-30 minutes we get our appetizer, still no soup though and that's supposed to come first.  Buser 1 delivers the appetizer but practically drops the dish on the table with a loud thud and immediately walks away. About 10-20 minutes later the other dishes started coming. The worst dish was the sizzling pepper steak. The thing about this dish is when it comes to your table, the steak is supposed to be sizzling in the metal tray. In our case, it came out at room temperature (meat and metal pan), so as you can expect, absolutely no sizzle.Sometime throughout the meal, we asked Buser 1 if we're supposed to get soup. He responds by saying don't ask him, ask the waiter. So we ask one of the waiters and he apologizes and says he'll get us soup. About 10 minutes later, we still haven't received the soup so we don't really bother anymore. The waiter walks by and asks if we have received our soup yet, which we said not yet, and he could tell by the lack of soup bowls. He immediately gets someone (again) to bring out soup. This time, Buser 2, puts the bowl of soup down, not sure where his mind is at, but drops the soup spoon into the bowl and splashes all of us with soup, my mom suffering the most splash damage. He says sorry once, but for an incident like that, I think you should be more apologetic.After a few more dishes arrive, we ask for rice, which is not something that you should need to do yourself at a Chinese restaurant.Finally when we're done eating, we ask Buser 1 for some to-go boxes. He goes and brings back boxes and before he walks away says ""Ask someone else to do it"". WTF kind of attitude is thatIn the end, they had the audacity to charge us 18% gratuity on a party of 4 with dreadful service. Overall the food was decent, but it was PAINFUL to eat with that degree of service.

"[Review for DIMSUM only]I'm sure you've needed to buy a car - a brand-spanking-new one OR a semi-whored-out-used version - at one point in your life and have experienced a nagging-dying-to-complete-a-sale-to-take-out-a-chick-salesperson. It wasn't the greatest of experiences rightWell, meet the DIMSUM version.I really wonder if these ladies work here on a full commission basis OR have been set STRICT ASIAN QUOTAS (those having worked overseas OR know someone who does may have learnt at some point how some retail outlets staff actually have DAILY quotas to meet...OR else ADIOS bish). They sure fly around in their dimsum carts like the establishment is a go-cart-track...and pushing for sales a LOT more aggressively than I would say a carsalesperson would at the end of the month.Best part The moment they knew I spoke Chinese...they went gung-ho-YOU-need-MORE-meat-on-you-SON-""YOUTOOSKINNNNNNNNNNNNNY"" on me. (Bish, please...you look anoxeric! Maybe) Well, they still WON...since I tend to be a pushover with asian-aunties-battling-menopause and their dimsum carts...and found my small table for 2 with food for at least 5 gargantuan eaters.Yet, this place, which was recommended by locals (asian ladies that you'd find working at the hotels and casinos that I randomly started conversations with to ask for tips on LOCAL food joints), isn't that great. (I think I got trolled.)Oilier dimsum...below average quality (just seems like the food sat out a little too long as well as tasting rather bland...)...and ISN'T PIPING HOT...mehBut what really killed it for me was this ever present sour taste that wasn't vinegar...and if you know your dimsum (OR even any other food in general)...this ISN'T A GOOD SIGN. Maybe, the health department might have to come over for an (S)INspection...before, as comedian Russel Peters imitates his dad, ""Somebody Gonna Get a Hurt Real Bad"".If you're craving dimsum, I'd say...just wait until you get out of Vegas and hit a real spot instead. And if you HAVE to be here, please don't order the dimsum BUT order ala carte dishes instead - at least if the food isn't that fresh, the raging fire under the wok will fudgingly kill everything in it.It may just save you a trip to the porcelain throne of shame.

"111310Don't ever come here!!  Should've known better than to stay and try the food,  after having to wait several minutes before being greeted by our server (the restaurant was empty except for seated employees about to have a meal); It took more than ten minutes before we were given glasses of water.  Service was very slow (the noodles arrived first, and that was half an hour or more after we arrived); our server was surly, almost to the point of rudeness; and my nephew and I even checked out the aquarium there-- it was almost void of live fish (maybe one swimming), w dead fish and excrement floating in the cloudy water.  NASTY!  But (and there's always a ""but"" in these kinds of reviews, isn't there) we were starving... Next time, I will insist on going somewhere else, especially when there are many signs telling us to!  (Funnily enough, the restroom here wasn't that bad...  I'm thinking maybe not many people came to eat here, so the restrooms aren't used much  LOL)Total bill was just under $50, w minimal tip.  Food included about six dim sum plates, a beef stir-fry, lo mein noodles, tea, and water.  The only item all of us liked here (Mom, sister, my nephew, and me) were the noodles!  The beef stir-fry was the only thing I thought was palatable, w some of the meat tougher than the others.  (Don't even get me started on the dim sum fillings!) I'd never recommend this place for dim sum to anyone!  I wouldn't be surprised to hear this place closing down very soon, if it isn't already. What a horrible experience.  :(

"So... this is what happens when you open the only Dim Sum restaurant in the dessert... utter chaos.Dim sum normally has large quantities of selection of food constantly moving around the restaurant in carts. You see what you like, you pick it, you eat it. Portions are small so price is decent.The quality of food here was terrible. But come on, you say, this is fracking Phoenix! What did you expect Fine fine fine. I'll stomach cold dim sum that was suppose to be hot, chewy meat instead of tender, and bland instead of flavorful...The place is a dump and the line is 40 minutes long. Well, it is the only dim sum place no The chaos though that is inside is what get's the place a 1 star. First off I don't even see how this place is setup for Dim Sum. The tables are arranged in a maze like formations where the carts can't even get to you.Forget the fact that the carts can't reach you, most patrons got up and chased them down and brought back their own food. In the end we didn't even get most of what we wanted cuz they sold out. One of the employees shrugged his shoulders and told us next time to chase down we want to get instead of waiting. Totally not worth the wait, especially since the food quality was terrible.

Especially after writing a favorable review of Great Wall the first time around. But our experience here was not good during our last visit.First, we were not acknowledged when we came in the door. We had to pardon an employee (who appeared to be doing nothing) to take us in. He then proceeded to take us to a booth after we requested a table and chairs. We asked again to be seated at a table and chairs and he finally obliged. We were given menus and that's when the real trouble began in terms of service. First, we ordered a lot of food. 2 main dishes, 2 appetizers, 2 drinks, and an extra side dish to split. It was my last night in Phoenix so I wanted to go all out and sample some different things. Besides, we have the money so who cares right Well, the drinks came and when we ordered the server let us know there were no BBQ pork ribs, but didn't offer an alternative. When I picked something else, he rolled his eyes and said ""So you really want pork"". Yes. I do. So we waited for our appetizers, only one of which came out before the main dishes. The others came out with the dinners. Now the food was good, I have no complaints there. But when the person bringing us the food came out, she would't even look at us. The feeling I was getting was that they were either disgusted with our presence or just didn't care to talk to their non-Asian customers. I say that because the servers were ""chatting up"" the Chinese folks at their tables (it wasn't a busy night only a few small families), but they were literally ignoring us and a hispanic family sitting adjacent to us. I wouldn't normally write about that but it was so egregious I have to say how it appeared to look. I wish I could say it had something to do with language barriers and being comfortable with your native tongue maybe, but they spoke English fine from what I saw and it just didn't feel good to be ignored. Anyway, no refills on tea, water, or our main drinks were given. When we were done, we were ignored for 20 minutes until I glared at another server who was having banter with an Asian couple near us. I guess he told our server to bring us a check. So we pull out the Amex and what do you know For the first time all night our server immediately comes over and says in perfect English ""we don't take American Express"" (even though the tray the bill was on says ""Amex Preferred"", but that's neither here nor there.Wow. Once it was time to pay, he's on my shoulder like a parrot. Prior to that, he wanted nothing to do with us. Finally, the woman who came out to put the food in 'to-go' bags literally ignored us even after I smiled and tried to talk to her. She turned her head away when my date tried to thank her for putting everything in bags for us. And our sending off Waiting another 10 minutes for someone to come take the card before giving up and walking to front and giving the bill to someone who appeared to be a manager. No tip given. You've got to be kidding me. In the end this experience wrecked what was supposed to be my new Chinese food place. The service ruined what was great food. The feeling I got while there was that they didn't particularly care if we (non-Chinese customers) were there. And that is really sad. Needless to say, we won't be coming back.

"I went here today to have dim sum with my friend and it was end up uncomfortable. We sit there for 15' and nobody came to ask anythings. After the foods were brought out, we asked 3 waitresses for the sauce and had nothing. Then i asked the waiter again and he brought it w unhappy face and through the dish in front of us. We order 5 dishes but they brought out only four. When we finished and checked out, one of them told me we still have shrimp ball is making, and that was 45' after we ordered it. I didnt want it anymore. When i paid i didnt put the tip in my card and he came to our table to check if we put the tip on the table. What the heck Should i leave the tip for the service we had

"Hubby's been here before with some friends. We stopped in here to grab a few baskets of dim sum. It was lunch time and there were a lot of people in the restaurant, but only 3 trolleys roaming around over and over again. One trolley was jook with Chinese donut, the other two were dim sum items. Well, the dim sum wasn't all that great. It was mediocre at best. We had 4 baskets and the total came to slightly over $11 before tip. The tripe was flavorless, the stuffed bean curd sheets were okay. Har gow were below average, leaving the cha siu bao being the only thing passable. One of the servers came over and asked if we wanted to order some food. I asked hubby and he asked for the check. The woman then asked me in Cantonese if the food wasn't to my liking. I thought ""ya think"" but then didn't really verbalize it. Why be nasty But we'll never come back again on future trips.

"Did you ever want to try a new restaurant that was rated pretty well and found out that you should whip out the ol' Blackberry and log onto the site just to heave the thing across the room in the hopes of watching the communicative device shatter into a glorious spectacle of plastic and debris Well this was the case in the following review I'm about to ""drop"" on you! The wife read about Chang's Hong Kong Cuisine that a ""Yelper"" had reviewed. We were planning a trip to Vegas and figured that we would try something different, as opposed to the usual buffets that we would normally head straight for. Innocently enough, we made a B-Line straight to Chang's once we arrived in Vegas and was anticipating a decent Dim Sum experience. Once we got there, we were left standing in the Foyer for a few minutes. During this time, I noticed that one of the servers arrived late from behind us and hadn't had the chance to clock in before she sat us. I just found that kinda funny and thought I would share this with you! =) As the Brunch progressed, the wife got really tiffed because the best Chinese team, in terms of timing and follow-through, in the Dim Sum industry decided that they would all take the day off and allow the lack-luster, slow, and incompetent crew work a solid day. Whoa is me! Service was slow, our tea order was really late, the food was sub-par, and most of all, my hot chili sauce was late! I loves me some hot chili sauce with my Dim Sum dumplins!I think that the highlight of our experience was when my wife finally threw in the towel and flagged down a Chinese lady and berated her with God knows what! I couldn't tell you what she said but service surely improved from that point on! God I love feisty Chinese women! The Dim Sum itself was not memorable and the chicken feet were like the worst things because it tasted breaded before braising.  It felt and tasted gummy.  The prices were great and its location was easy to find! It wasn't tucked in the corner of some sleezy shopping plaza that may be impossible to get into or out--to! The final note from me is that, all in all, I will not go out of my way to come back here. I think the only way I would is if a friend clocked me over the head with a baseball bat (preferably metal..my head might shatter a wooden one then I'll be left cleaning the bits of splintered wood from the carpet with a headache! Who wants that!) and bribe the paramedics to drop us off here rather than the Hospital. Maybe this way I wouldn't mind the mediocre tasting food, but I'd probably bleed out before I get my chili sauce! =(

"FOUR STARS Are you fucking kidding me Come on Vegas, step your dim sum game up... Three words to describe the waitresses:LOUD, RUDE, OBNOXIOUS. Food is mediocre... I'd say below average compared to 626, SD, or even Irvine. So if you've had any of the above, this place will DISAPPOINT ... and definitely annoy the shit out of you.

"On 91910 my family (6 adults, 4 children (5yrs & under) went to enjoy dim sum at what WAS our favorite restaurant. We I reviewed the bill I noticed an unfamiliar high-priced amount on the bill. I went to the cashier station and asked what was the charge for, I was told it is a service charge for parties over 8 people. I said, ""there are only 6 adults and 4 children."" He (I believe the owner) just shrouded his shoulders and said, ""that's our service charge."" $19.25!!!! - that's an extreme charge for servicing water refills and collecting empty dim sum containers. Sunday dim sum  Chang's is now a thing of the past for us...Ping Pang Pong here we come!

"Whoever says that this place is better than the SGV dim sum restaurants must be trully stupid or get their head bang in the shower. This place is horrendous. If you see the color of the chicken feet you  know that its not going to taste good. The rest of the food seems cooked too long and the service is slow.I mean, I understand when you go to chinese restaurant you expect the service to suck ass cos thats the way they operate, but when you have the owner operating as cashier that tell the customer to pay upfront then you should just open a to go counter instead of a full dining restaurant.If you dont know how to open a full seating restaurant, go slow, open a little to go place first!!!

"Dim Sum here is terrible.  Charlotte does not have enough competition for Dim Sum.  I used to live in Atlanta.  I enjoyed the dim sum houses there.  I grade Dim Houses with a curve in Charlotte.  I am not expecting them to be as good as Atlanta.  Even with a curve, the dim sum is terrible.     I went on a weekend.  Many of the dumplings were obviously frozen and not fresh.  Dim Sum was very heavy as well.  I only ordered steam items and a few pan fried items.  However, I had a real full stomach.  I was not feeling good at all.  I did not even eat much.  The dim sum was flavorless and greasy.   If you live in Charlotte, go to China Delight in Atlanta to get good dim sum.

"Do not get the spare ribs with black bean sauce unless you are more adventurousinsane. It was a gelatinous surprise. I wasn't sure what part of the animal I was really eating. It did not come out in rib form, it was all hacked and thrown together. It was honestly ghastly. I tried a bite. Nope, but still politely paid for it. O the quiet dissonance. Google image spare ribs. Yeah, I thought it would at least resemble that-obviously smaller- with a different sauce. *After re googling ""chinese spare ribs"" I am a bit alarmed at how different my dish was from all of the images that showed up. The sauce was described as black bean but came out clear and mucus like. Black bean was a really misleading image.The glass they brought my drink in was not clean. I mean, it was really not clean.  Skinlip gloss. Lip residue. I asked if I could have a drink in a can and they just brought me the same drink in another glass.The chicken and pork steamed buns here had a mold looking residue on the paper beneath them. I still ate it for some reason Over compensating here... Service was OK. The sanitation score is 88.5.I got some lo meinchicken dish to go and the entire time I was convinced the chicken they used was uterus. It was in these weird, long, thin strips, that sort of curled. They had these strange indentations all through out one side of the chicken. I feel like a jerk writing this, but what is that meat Throw some white chicken breast in that instead and it would be wonderful. The noodles were wonderful, the meat was sketchy. Yet, I still ate it.This seems to be a neighborhood favorite place for some reason

"I would give this 0 star if I can. We went in Sunday to start our day with some dim sums, since they are the freshest on Sunday. And they actually roll the dim sum in carts.When we walked in, I can see they are very busy. And there's 3 pplz in front of us. The front lady asked us how many, after I told her 2 she just walk off seating a guy in front of us. She came back and start seating these 2 pplz came after us. And then another lady came to ask how many we have. While I was telling her 2 pplz, the previous walked back and seat these 4 pplz just walk in.So I asked her is there supposed to be a line. She was like no, they seat according to table. I was like I understand if the table fit 10, then u don't want to use it for 2 pplz. However if the table fit 4, I expected to be seat before other pplz that just walk in.The dim sum is not the best, but it'll do for Charlotte. It's just that lady just ruined my whole mood to eat there, so we walk out and decided to try Krazy Fish down the road.Probably will not go back for a long while!!!

"So, obviously, I'm one of those people who doesn't learn from their mistakes.  This time, instead of going into the restaurant for dim sum, we ordered Chinese takeout.  The soups were meh.  Neither the wonton nor the hot and sour soup had much flavor.  Next came the entrees.  For our family dinner night, we ordered Sesame Chicken, Orange Chicken, and Sweet & Sour Chicken entrees.  Neither of the kids cared much for the Sweet & Sour Chicken.  They said it ""tasted funny.""  They didn't even want to put on the sweet, sticky red sauce that came in a big container on the side.  And what kid doesn't love that  That's never been an issue before.  My partner had the Orange Chicken which looked and tasted like chicken covered in the exact same red sweet & sour sauce.  He, too, was not thrilled.  Mine was the Sesame Chicken.  It, too, came in what looked like the EXACT SAME red sweet & sour sauce with a few (a very few) sesame seeds sprinkled on top.  I've never had Sesame Chicken that wasn't in a flavorful BROWN sauce and covered in sesame seeds.  Mine, too, was practically flavorless.  The accompanying rice they gave us was pretty dry and sticky.  Lastly, there were no fortune cookies to finish off a below-average meal.  To top it all off, the restaurant had apparently significantly raised the prices on everything since the last take-out menu we had on hand.  So, when picking up the order, we paid more than expected and the quality was practically non-existent.  Dim Sum is OFF our list FOREVER for both take-out and dine-in.  As our once-president once said, ""Fool me once, shame on ... shame on you. Fool me... You can't get fooled again.""

"We drove all the way from Raleigh (3 hour drive) to eat at this place. We came at 9:00pm thirty minutes before closing. There were quite a few customers in there at the time. As we walked in an older lady shouted we are closed to us and shoo-ing us out the door. We were all upset and about to leave then she throws a paper at us telling us hurry up and order standing there rushing us saying come on hurry up and order. We did not drive all the way to charlotte for this kind of service so we left and didn't even get to eat. We did not appreciate being rushed and forced to order something quickly especially if it's our first time here.

"Came here with some friends and experienced sub-par food and terrible service. First of all, the food came out really slow for a mid afternoon lunch and hardly any customers. Second, there was a really long hair coiled around a fried dumpling just under the skin and was clearly visible from the outside. I called over the waitress to bring it to her attention and she simply grabbed the plate and left. There was no apology or acknowledgement of the tainted food. We weren't sure if she was going to bring us a new batch or comp the charge so we just ended up waiting for an eternity before she came back.She brought three new dumplings, but my group was too disgusted with the food and the service to even look at them. We asked for the check and another lady (I assume a manager) came to speak with us. She asked us if everything was okay and if there were any problems. She made it seem like the hair incident hadn't been brought to her attention so I mentioned that there was a hair in our food. She rudely answered that she already knew this. So...why did you ask us if we had any problems if you already knew about the issue Nevertheless, she gave us a thoughtless, mechanical apology and comped us for only one of the two orders of dumplings even though we didn't eat either of the orders.All in all, I was extremely disappointed in the way they handled the situation and I will definitely not be back.

"I think I made a terrible mistake and ordered Americanized -Chinese food from a Dim Sum Restaurant.  We ordered two extra-crispy General Tso's Chicken with added rice (one white, one fried) and an egg roll. They do not serve combos here so our two entrees came to about $23. There was a lot of food - but it was a little pricier than some of the other fast food Chinese take-out places. I don't mind paying extra if it's tasty- and it really wasn't that much more in terms of price. It was hands down the worst Chinese I have ever tasted. The rice had a rancid flavor - it smelled and tasted quite bad so my husband graciously offered his white rice to me. The base of fried rice is white rice so I doubt it was the rice itself but whatever they put in it was not appetizing. The chicken was soggy, sugary-sweet (tasted like a very spicey sweet and sour sauce, it was even bright red in color) ...it didn't taste like any General Tso's I have tasted before. I barely ate my dinner and because it was take-out I wasn't able to give management a chance to fix it unfortunately. There were a couple of highlights ...the staff went the extra step to attempt to keep the crispy texture and did not sauce the chicken until we picked up our dinners, which was very thoughtful of her. They also have a really delicious homemade eggroll. It was oily but you know what it had actual meat and veggies inside of it and that made me happy. Overall I just can't bring myself to come back for take-out, but I was told the Dim Sum on Sundays is delicious so I may give that a shot in six months once I forget about that rice that will haunt my dreams.

"Can't believe there are many reviews after my first one years ago. To be honest, I don't go there any more for few reasons. 1. The owner has changed2. The foods quality has changed3. Service is NOT as good as it used to be. 4. The original chief seem to be long gone. 5. Found a better places to have the best DIM SUM in Chandler AZOnce very satisfied customer is no longer their customer. If you want real good Chinese foods and restaurant services, go somewhere else. I guess I will never know how good their foods now. Don't even want to try.

"This place has become really BAD since the owners changed recently. The dim sum beef which used to be great has become rubbery and the pork has lost all its flavor. We used to enjoy this place before, but now on a recent weekend visit we saw only about a quarter of the tables occupied. After the dim sum lunch, we figured out why. The dirty place and rude waitresses were tolerable because of the good food... not anymore when cold tough meat is served.

"We tried this because it got good reviews. So we ordered to pick up, got the food back home, and each container had a ton of watery grease, the egg rolls were also full of grease. And the taste wasn't that great either, I felt like I could have gotten better food at panda express. One of the four people ended up with stomach problems the next day. The price was cheap but so was the food. I was expecting so much more.

"One of the most aggravating restaurants I have been to in awhile. My partner and I were so irritated that we both got into an argument we were so irritated.First arrive and there is a woman sitting behind the front counter and she does not greet us right away so we are standing there awkwardly not sure of what to do, my partner asks, ""are we supposed to sit ourselves"" to me. Then she finally greeted us and we were whisked away to a huge table for only the two of us. All of the colors are bright in here which didn't bother me the same way they seem to bother everyone else.We were given a very short menu with half in Chinese but then after awhile I see another couple with a very extensive menu and I am left wondering wth I checked online before I went and saw that they had vegetarian options which I did not see on this extremely short menu. The other couple was white and we are not so it was not like they got the better all Chinese menu because they were Asian or something. When the owner comes to the table we request the other menu which he was happy to oblige. There were so many options you could get lost in that menu but I liked it.We ordered a half duck, and vegetables in oyster sauce with jasmine tea. The duck came for some reason 10 minutes before my meal did so we both had to sit there waiting for my food because my partner did not want to eat without me. No Jasmine tea had come by that time 25 minutes after ordering. The duck was greasy and cold as my partner described it; it was like if someone had cooked it earlier in the day and left it out, room temperature and old tasting. When they finally came with my meal I found that the 'vegetables' was really only bok choy in some oyster sauce, I was very unhappy and the bok choy they gave me was mostly stems. We had to remind the original waiter to bring our tea and we ordered some spring rolls at that time.The tea finally came and my partner asked for a spoon for the rice and that took 5 minutes to bring that, I even think that was yet another waiter who came to the table. My partner asked if they could warm up the duck which they did. Service was sooo slow even though there were many workers. The spring rolls we ordered never came so in disgust we just had our meals boxed and walked up to the counter to pay rather than wait 20 minutes to pay a check at the table. We will get our roasted duck from Lee Lee's from now on.

"Seriously!!!! most DISGUSTING place ever! had a hair in the dumpling of the dim sum one time which will be my ever last time to go there!

"I'm sitting here at China King and am baffled at the high rating. The waitress told me they would not honor the Yelp  check-in special.  The restaurant is filthy. There is a film on the windows, and a pair of children's shoes strewn across the waiting area.  The child I think they belong to is actually standing on top of chairs SCREAMING for his mom. This is AWFUL.  There is also a dirty, empty bucket just outside of the front door. I'm not sure why, but eww!! The men's room is SO GROSS, and there's just all sorts of eww everywhere! My best instinct tells me I shouldn't have bothered, but I gave it a whirl, and... The food wasn't *horrible*. The fried rice was really bland. The Egg Drop Soup was kinda barfy. It had nasty peas corn and carrots, and the vegetables had been dehydrated.. they weren't dehydrated very well. My entree was General Tso's Chicken. It was certainly the highlight of the experience, but the chicken itself seemed oddly dense, and of low quality. The prices weren't super great either. I'm guessing all the hype is about the Dim Sum, and the more exotic seafood offerings. I'm still in disbelief that they would not accept the check-in special, filth factor makes me wonder what kind of public health hazard China King is.

"Very unimpressed for dim sum on a Tuesday.  Not very many carts with food. Someone was carrying food but bypassed our table and went to other tables.  We had to call them to our table.  By the time the person came to our table there wasn't much selection.  Service here is indifferent and lackluster.  Many tables are just waiting for any carts.  Definitely not worth coming her for dim sum, especially on a Tuesday.  This is the worst dim sum experience I've ever had anywhere.  Was here before for dinner and it was uneventful.

"Saltiest (and most expensive) noodles ever!For a whopping $13, I got the equivalent of a bowl of noodles that would've cost $4 at a normal noodle shop.  I asked for udon noodles with my Cantonese Dumpling noodles.  Instead, I got egg noodles.  Which was fine, since egg noodles were probably the better choice for a noodle soup with dumplings.  However, I must've downed a whole pitcher of water by the time I was through with the noodles. So, one star for the price, messing up my order, and the saltiness that was pervasive in all of their noodle soups.

"The fact that it's overpriced is pretty apparent, but their service SUCKS.Take Cindy, for example, who took care of our party of 9.  For some reason, I think she didn't like me because I wanted warm water.  When I asked for the said item, she responded with ""We have tea - jasmine, oolong, etc.""  I asked her again, ""Do you have warm water""  She says, ""Yes, but we have tea.""  OK, I get the fucking point.  You have tea and you're trying to charge me for it, but I don't fucking want it.Whilst taking my order, Cindy didn't understand when I pointed to what I wanted and specified ""chicken.""  Because instead, she tells me i can choose from bbq pork, duck, or chicken.  I said, yeah that chicken.  OK, that wasn't even the worse part.When she brought back everyone's dishes, my order was missing.  However, she had a two bbq item rice plate in her hand.  I realized the person next to me had switched her order at the last minute, and Cindy the server must have accidentally switched my order.  Cindy hands me the rice plate and says ""Here you go.""  I told her, ""I didn't order this.  You must have accidentally switched my order out instead of the person next to me.""  Cindy responds with, ""You don't want this""  I said, ""NO, I didn't order this.  I ordered the poached chicken rice noodle.""  Cindy says ""Oh."" and runs off.She does indeed come back with the right order, but never offers an apology.  She gave me a fat attitude during the whole damn time.And the noodles  Well, I've had better.  And it never cost me $13.50.I would never recommend Noodles to anyone.

"Way, way overpriced. Sure Vegas is expensive but this place goes beyond overpriced to obscenely overpriced and for just ok food. Not much in way of veggie options and if you ask, it's a flat no, you can't make any changes. Tried to ask whether or not the vegetable roll had any meat or seafood in it. I was met with ""vegetable roll"" and a weird totally fake smile. But does it have any meat in it ""vegetable roll"" only a little louder with the fake smile. There's no meat in it ""vegetable roll!"" Well, that was helpful. Never mind, I don't need to be eating fried food anyways. Food is also very salty, I was dying of thirst for the rest of the day.

My friend got the combination rice which came with roasted duck which was a bit tastey and the soya chicken which came out cold and not very flavorful.I guess vietnamese or asian food is considered exotic espeically in vegas therefore they feel that they can jack up the prices really high.I would definately not come here again espcially for the price and the taste wasn't on the authentic side either.

"We waited in line, which i thought showed a good sign that this Noooooodles Restaurant was good. Boy was I WRONG! Tired from all the activities in the Bellagio, I was looking forward to a good meal, I did not get it here. The food was not great, I wonder if I was eating a restaurant that didn't know they served bad food. I wanted to take my food to go and give to a needy person on the street. Never again, even if i hit the big $$$ in the casino.

"We were one of the first to arrive at 10:30AM on a Saturday morning, but the room filled up over the next hour.  I failed to write down what we ate, but 5 of the 7 dishes we tried contained pretty much the same ingredients of ground pork and shrimp.  The best dish was the egg tarts with the worst being the barbecued pork bun which was all bun, no pork.  Prices were relatively inexpensive, but the food quality and variety were disappointing.

"When we were here last year, we didn't like this place much. The service was slow, we waited for the Dim Sum carts for 5-15 minutes. I had to push the cart to our table... boy, I didn't think they run that fast after me... since they were so slow with the cart. =P Food was ok, but I would recommend Chang's Hong Kong Cuisine instead.

"WORDS THAT DO NOT GO TOGETHER Discount & Sushi Freelance & Gynecology Refurbished & Pacemaker And most recently... DIM SUM & ALL DAY As soon as I heard it was an all day dim sum place my spidey sense went berserk. I tried mentioning other options like Noodle Palace, KFC, or even cyanide...but I didn't want to be rude to the birthday girl so off we went. 1st Impression: It's 2pm on a Friday...this is SO not the time to go for dim sum. 2nd Impression: Overflowing trashcan as soon as you walk in. ***getting nauseous*** 3rd Impression: The smell of rancid oil. ***Mental note not to eat anything fried and getting more nauseous*** 4th Impression: I bit down into a COLD piece of siu mai. ***Thinking happy thoughts to hold back chunks***5th Impression: 'Why aren't we leaving', I think to myself as we proceed to order MORE food. 6th Impression: 12 the food that we order is cold and we are forced to ask the cart lady to get us hotter trays from the bottom of the cart ***Thinking about where I can locate and Epipen and wondering why we're still there*** In summary: This is one of the nastiest dim sum places I have EVER encountered. As I predicted, all day dim sum means a lot of their stuff is frozen and machine made (e.g. har gao, char siu bao, etc.). If you have no idea what good dim sum tastes like, don't like yourself very much, or are in a state where euthanasia is illegal then come on in. Otherwise, avoid like the plague.

"This place used to be good...we've been going for a few years. We overlooked that it was dirty because the food was cheap and good. We're Chinese and sadly expect a lot of good Chinese food places to be on the dirty side. Over the past 6 months, we've had really bad food experiences.We kept going back hoping it was going to get better again or maybe the last time was a bad fluke. After 5 more of these bad experiences, we knew we won't be going back even though it was the only place we knew that had 24hr dim sum. The service is typical rude Chinese, and I'm Chinese. Sometimes the dim sum is spoiled tasting. Recently they kept raised the prices of the dim sum and they will stamp a higher priced letter than what is listed on the menu. We never complained when we first saw them stamping higher priced dim sum items when it should have been the lowest priced item because we didn't want to be the ""complainers"". It's also a totally different price than what they advertise on the sign outside.  Thank goodness my mom knows her math, cuz I just pay a bill when I get it. Well they over charged us by $35 recently and had the nerve to argue with us about it. When we forced them to re-add, they never apologized or admitted to any wrong doing. They corrected the amount, put it on the table and walked away. We definitely will never return and suggest that the people who do go, keep a watchful eye on the dim sum stamp as well as add up your own bill. And if it tastes wierd, it's probably spoiled because they have all day dim sum and the crap may have been sitting out all day.

"Despite how hard I rate businesses, its actually rare for me to give a 1 star. Its like a restaurant has to try to get a 1 star review from me.I came here around 12:15 waiting for my the others in my party. When they arrived, it was around 1pm. We got seated, and I swear someone released a stink bomb in the room or something, the entire place turned into a ghost town. Calamari - I ate it. it was cold. Was I in a sushi restaurant, not a dim sum restaurant Nope. Just horrible. Shrimp Dumplings - One of the orders, the skin fell apart. The other the shrimp was all mushy, as if it has been nuked in the microwave.  Pork Dumplings - Cold and mushy. Same texture as the shrimp dumplings.  Sesame Balls - Oily, cold, goopy item. Once this gets cold, it just gross. Jook - They ran out by 1PM. Blah.There were more items, but I guess they weren't good enough for me to remember the dishes. Some of you may be saying, show up earlier or go during prime time dim sum time. Yup, I'm fully aware of that. But what kind of establishment goes from good to suckage for the changeover to regular lunch If a restaurant lets me order it, I can review it as is. This just shows poor quality control on their part, willing to sacrifice their name to earn a couple of bucks for disappointing dim sum. Either keep up the quality or don't serve dim sum after a certain time.I'll be willing to give this place another chance and I'll come during prime time, but I can't see the score improving that much. Until then, stay out of this place after 1pm.

"I've been here several times with family since I was a kid. The service is like many of the Chinese restaurants in Vegas. BAD! Which is fine, since I'm used to it by now, but my last experience here made me never want to come back.I decided to come here one day craving Dim Sum. It was the closest location to my school so I decided to pay Orchid Garden a visit. I went in, glad to see there was no line, made I contact with at least 3 different people and had to wait 10 minutes before I was seated. I understand if it is not your job as a cart pusher to seat customers, but I'm sure you have the ability to sit me down at a table or at least notify the host to seat me.Once I was seated, I wanted ordered my usual Har Gow, Siu Mai, Chow Fun, and Shrimp balls; however, after being served cold shrimp balls and Siu Mai, I couldn't eat any more of the food they were serving. The 5 waitresses running around the restaurant didn't ever have time to check and ask if ""everything is okay"" or if there's ""anything I need.."" So I helped myself and my girlfriend to the counter, asked for the check, left no tip and walked out.I highly recommend eating at Cathay or Chang's for Dim Sum. They are alot friendlier and the food is much better.

"This was our breakfast before we headed back home after our mini vacation in SIn City. After reading good reviews about this place the BF and I decided to give it a try and sadly we were disappointed! First off they didn't open until 10:30, shouldn't dim sum be open at 8! When they finally opened we got seated right away but service was VERY slow as there was only ONE CHART walking around to serve 12+ tables with families waiting for some dim sum. I don't know why it's so packed but it must be good right .....WRONG!!! .....When the lady finally came up to us there wasn't a lot of selection to choose from and the usual items that we get back home weren't that good at all. The shu mai was okay I give them that but  the chicken feet was disgusting and everything else didn't taste fresh at all. Totally would not eat here again!

"I've had a big change of opinion after spending more time in that gym. The equipment would often break down and never get fixed. Considering how small the gym is, it's inexcusable that two treadmills would be out of service for at least a month. I also had problems with the individual TVs on machines; sometimes they wouldn't work properly or would be completely broken.The gym was generally quiet enough in the mornings, but it would be pretty packed after work. It was hard to find a machine. The staff also didn't really enforce the 30 min time-limit policy, which caused people to have to wait for equipment longer than necessary.I was told on the phone I needed to let them know before the 25th of a given month to cancel my membership moving forward (and not be charged for the next month). I wasn't told that I had to give 30 days notice (aka pay for an extra month). Though they're technically right (it IS in the contract), I feel that their staff mislead me.If you live in Shadyside (or nearby)... GO TO URBAN ACTIVE INSTEAD. It's cheaper and the facilities are unbelievably better than XShadyside... although I apparently have a membership at XShadyside for another month now, I am 100% done with that place.

"We went on a Friday and it wasn't too busy. We all had a wonderful time until the end. We were in the womens locker room and even though they had a family locker room there were little boys there about 6-7 years old changing in the room too and one walking around with no clothes on. I had my little sister and did not appreciate it at all. When I talked to staff all they asked me was if they had autism It doesnt chnge anything.Come on there was a family bathroom right there. And they didn't seem too concerned about my complaint. And the bathrooms were nasty. But if you don't use the locker rooms or bathrooms it is good.

"I ... don't know why I keep going back to Olive or Twist. Seriously, you could check my Foursquare stats and see that I've been to this bar more frequently than any place I've ever called my favorite spot in Pittsburgh. Why I moved up here from Orlando to be with my boyfriend who I had just started dating. I moved because Orlando on a whole sucks and I was ready to get out. My boyfriend used to play in a band as does one of his best friends now. This was their favorite spot to hang out out because all of the (female) bartenders know and love them. They used to get free or greatly reduced drinks, could be as loud and obnoxious as they wanted, etc. etc. - the ush. I tag along now because I didn't know many people in this city at first, obviously. The bar is way too small for the number of people who try to pack in at night. I've had several items off of the menu and they all left a lot to be desired. The drinks are poured strongly. At first I thought this was because the bartenders knew how the boys liked their drinks, but now I realize they're just heavy handed. Nothing here really sticks out for me. I can get the drinks properly made elsewhere for the price. Same with the food. I guess the only reason I agree to go back time after time is because of two of the bartenders - Amy and Linda. Those two are the most kick ass bartenders in Pittsburgh. Considering I currently live in Heinz, it's also pretty damn close, which works in its favor (can't wait to move ... ). Olive or Twist has a great location and, if Amy andor Linda are working, you're sure to enjoy yourself. Just keep those expectations low.

"We were in Pittsburgh for one night and Olive or Twist was near our hotel.  There were many other restaurants, but this place looked nice.  The atmosphere was nice, and if I was rating only for atmosphere I'd give it 4 stars.  However, I'm mainly rating their food and service.  We were greeted promptly, but after that the service was spotty and it took awhile to receive our drinksfood even though there weren't many people in the dining room.  I ordered the Traditional French Dip Sandwich and Fries.  I enjoy a good French Dip and have tried many of them at all types of restaurants and this one was the worst I've ever eaten. In fact, I couldn't finish it.  The meat tasted like old lunch meat and the bread was nothing more than a cheap, glorified hot dog roll that was soggy.  It wasn't soggy from the Au Jus, but it tasted like they steamed the roll for some reason.  Overall, if I was going back to Pittsburgh in this area, I would stay far away from Olive or Twist.

"I've actually had OK experiences at this place in the past but this trip was especially bad. I tried to stop here with my husband for an appetizer and a drink before heading into the theater district - bad move.  Upon being seated the server explained that they were no longer serving food because of a water leak or something unsanitary-sounding. Klassy. For reasons I truly can't explain, we decided to stay for a beer before heading to our destination. We both threw down a brew nasty, paid and left. Unfortunately for Olive or Twist, the visit would probably be our last.On a positive note, there was an interesting man setting up for what looked like a live acoustic set. His warm-up sounded good but we left before he really got started. When it's all said and done, we should have just went to the Sharp Edge down the street. Probably a much safer bet for future endeavors.

When one of your co-workers suggests a work happy hour, direct them anywhere else.

"Very disappointed.  I had been to Olive or Twist for drinks and really enjoyed it but had never been there for a meal.  I was going to a show at the Benedum with a friend and made reservations about a week and a half before the show.  We arrived about 15 minutes early for our 6:00 reservation expecting we may not be able to be seated yet.  The problem is that even though I called and made a reservation (including the person answering the phone taking my name and phone number and repeating the date and time) we were told there was no reservation for our name.  The hostess said something along the lines of ""are you sure you called here to make a reservation and not somewhere else""  Yes, I'm pretty sure I called the right restaurant...  She kept looking at the room of empty tables, looking at the book and then looking at us.  After a few minutes of back and forth, she told us the lounge upstairs was open and we were welcome to grab a table up there.  So we trudged upstairs.  All that was available were small high top tables.  Being a Friday night, it was packed with the happy hour crowd and was pretty noisy.  Not really the environment we were looking for but we decided to make the most of it.We started with the Buffalo Chicken Dip appetizer.  It is served in a martini glass with toastedfried pita chips.  It was tasty and we were surprised at how much dip there actually was.  The problems with food began with the pacing of the meal.  We had our appetizer for under five minutes when our entrees came out.  It may not have been a big deal if we were at a real table in the restaurant downstairs, but being at the high top bar tables, we had no room for our drinks, appetizer and meal.  We found ourselves stacking stuff and pulling things off the table in order to fit everything.  It was frustrating.  Not to mention that we would either have to let our entrees get cold as we finished the appetizer or let the appetizer get cold as we ate our entrees.  With as much as we enjoyed the appetizer, we were looking forward to our meals. Unfortunately, they were very disappointing.  My friend ordered the french dip sandwich with a side of mashed potatoes.  Her potatoes were ice cold and sandwich luke warm.  When she mentioned it to the server, the server said ""so would you like me to take them back or are they ok""  When would cold mashed potatoes ever be OK  When her potatoes were brought back warmed, she was disappointed because they were called ""garlic mashed"" but she said they were pretty bland with not much garlic at all.I ordered the Caribbean Jerk Chicken.  It was described as ""grilled chicken seasoned with jerk spices, pepper jack cheese, garlic mayo and pineapple chutney on a Kaiser roll""  No mention of a tomato.  When I got the sandwich, there were three tomatoes on it.   Thankfully I just dislike tomatoes and it wasn't an allergy issue.  There was also no pineapple chutney.  When I asked about it, the server told me they use a sauce and it must have been soaked into the roll.Overall, very disappointed.  I wanted to love Olive or Twist because I really enjoyed the time I had visited for a drink, but the dining experience was sorely lacking, especially for a dinner that was supposed to be a nice laid back start to our girl's night out.

"At the request of a friend, we had a brief girls night out at Olive or Twist. My first impression was the outdated decor. The restaurant has carpet which I find off putting. The drink menu is extensive; but, with the exception of one person in my party, we each found our drinks far too sweet. I ordered the cucumber basil martini, which was so sweet I had to send it back. The food was mediocre. I ordered the burger medium and it was over cooked to nearly well done. And then there was the cheesy lounge singer who sang a mishmosh of singer songwriter tunes from the 80s. The music was so loud and so bad that my friends I left and headed down the street to Butcher and the Rye.

"I stopped in last night for a drink with a group of friends... we were in town visiting and I had been wanting to try this place out since we walked past it on the last trip... what a disappointment.  The server was prompt to greet us and drop off drink menus, but then she failed to return to take our order for at least 20 minutes.  It would've been different if she had been slammed, but the entire time she was standing by the bar, just talking to her coworkers.  By the time she came to take our order we were ready to leave... and we should have... the martinis were not good and the server's disposition left much to be desired.  When we were ready to leave she made us feel like it was a bother to split our tabs between the five of us.  The one positive of the place was that I liked the ambiance, but it wasn't enough to make up for everything else being lackluster.  What I was hoping to be a great ending to the night turned into a dismal experience that put everyone in a bad mood.

"Husband ordered calamari,  tasted like the oil was very old.   Watched waiter bring our food to table next to us and then take it back to kitchen..then they brought us both salads with OLD, BROWN lettuce.    Seriously, that was a first for me.  I have never been served spoiled lettuce at a restaurant.     Hubby had salmon and said the flavor was good.   I had stuffed pork loin special which was good, with the exception of the ""side"" of pasta with pink, disgusting sauce on it.   What a disappointment.

"We went here for a birthday expecting it to be good based on the reviews, the restaurant itself is nice but the food was terrible beyond belief. I got the steak from there and when I cut into it, it looked stringing, rough, and disgusting. I couldn't eat it. My family was completely grossed out with their meals. When we went to tell the lady that our meals were terrible she was being sarcastic and very rude, in my opinion she has no respect for customers what so ever and for as nice as restaurant it is I will never go there again.

"DO NOT COME HERE! I'm not sure why this restaurant gets the reviews it does. First off... salmon is not white... its pink.  We spent 25 dollars on the special that was far from special.  Dried out crab stuffed in white chewing salmon. ReallyThe veal... don't get us started.  Chewy and I'm not convinced it was actually veal. The vegetables on both plates were not even luke warm.  Go to Babbo and spend a 34 of what we did.  What I'd do to have my 80 plus dollars back!  Summed up... just buy a tv dinner and save the cash!

"We have been going to Salute for over 10 years.  Has been our favorite place to go.  Went there for New Years Eve last night, never again.  Still great food, service questionable depending on the server but the ownerboss whatever she is has to be the most ignorant, uncaring, un-service oriented person I have ever met.  We merely questioned the menu re the lack of potato with a steak, the lack of Caesar salad at an Italian restaurant and she more or less told us too bad, the chef is working hard.  She told us that is the way it is, no apology.  We wanted to use a gift certificate from Restaurant.Com, wouldn't accept it.  Finally agreed to take a plain gift certificate.  We told her that we were not happy and would not be back.  She blatantly said, ""I don't care"" .  They will be out of business within 2 years.  Too bad, great place.  We talked to both staff members and other patrons on the way out and they totally agreed.

"Oh how the mighty have fallen.  When I first moved to Charlotte in '04 this was one of my favorite spots to hit.  The Wednesday lunch buffet was killer and the weekend breakfast buffet was equally awesome.  The girls ranged from night to night, but overall it was a solid showing.Moving back to Charlotte in '10 we went back to our old stomping grounds for more fun and frivolity.  Like an amusement park you used to go to as a kid we were saddened to see our awesome fun park degraded into a washed up shadow of its former self.It's strange, when the management changed they prettied up the place with a wine cellar and a second floor expansion yet everything else in the place went to shit.  The quality of the ladies took a drastic hit.  Last night's Saturday roster is what I would expect to see on a Tuesday afternoon.  Also, the security was not as sharp as it used to be.  One time at the breakfast buffet a fight broke out between two groups of Asians right by the omelette station.  Instead of well dressed bouncers swooping down to disperse the crowd the fight just fizzled out on its own with no interaction from security whatsoever.I used to recommend this place to everyone coming through Charlotte for its fun atmosphere and good food.  Now I can barely recommend the food and would honestly steer my friends to other places.

I gave a card and ID for my tab and my friend paid for drinks with cash as he got them. At the end of the night My friend checked out and then I paid the bill. I then found out that our waitress was billing my friends drinks to my tab while she's pocketing cash from my friend.I had to sign for the bill and the manager essentially told me to take a long walk off a short pier.

Nothing to do while waiting except select one of the few slot machines in this tiny joint and slide some cash in.  Then here comes the cocktail waitress.  Order is placed, and drink delivered.  Time for the tip.  Well, I always tip and did this time.  However another guy nearby wasn't going to tip, apparently.  So the waitress stands there for like 90 seconds after delivering the drink with her hand stuck out.....just standing there by this guy.   She refused to just walk away.  The guy finally says something like he'll take care of her next time around.  That really pisses her off and she spouts an obscene comment, then abruptly turns, walks away, and starts slamming things.  First time I've ever witnessed anything like that.I guess this must be part of the Fremont Street Experience too !  ha ha

"First of all, the place is a hole, and not in a good way. I wouldn't mind so much except I had an issue with the security guard who pinpointed me as ""trouble"" i suppose since it was Halloween and I was wearing a HAT that looked like a lion- it's a hat for CHILDREN. Perhaps I scared him, but he told me in order to remain in this establishment I'd have to remove my hat. I found this to be interesting since there were PLENTY of people inside of the casino wearing hats and not being asked to take theirs off. Many were in costume. Many were extremely shady looking, but he just passed by them without a second glance. Maybe he really dislikes lions. Either way, he pissed me off. Thanks to the cocktail waitress for the 2 free beers- she was pleasant at least.

"Oooof.  Had a rough time here last night.  Here's how it started.  I looked at the menu at their specialty cocktails and saw one that tickled my fancy: The Naughty Lemonade, made of simply TY KU and lemonade.  We went to the bar, and here is how the conversation went:""Hi, I'll have a Naughty Lemonade.""(Waitress scrunches face) ""Huh""""A Naughty Lemonade.""""What's that""""Ummm, it's on your menu.  It's TY KU and lemonade.""""What's TY KU  I don't think we have that.""""It's that green bottle right behind you.""""Ohhh, this must be something new.""""No, it's been around a couple of years and like I said, it's on your menu mixed with lemonade.""(Waitress opens the bottle and smells it) ""Do you want to smell it before you try it""""Ummm, no, I've had it before, that's why I ordered it.""""Do you want to try a sip""""Ok, you know what  Forget it, I'll just have a vodka and Sprite.""""Ok, a cranberry vodka coming up.""""NO, a vodka and SPRITE.""""Oh, ok.""And that's just how it started.  Other incidents:- We were done with our drinks, sitting there with empty glasses.  She comes over and says, ""Oh, did you guys want another round or something""- My friends were playing the machines for a good hour and she didn't comp them any drinks (usually customary if you play the machines at the bar) until they asked about it.  Then she said she didn't realize they had played...even though she cashed out their machine.  - My friend ordered a Johnnie Walker, and she gave him the JW Black without asking if he wanted the upsell.  When he called her on that after we looked at the bill, she said, ""Oh, I thought you said you wanted the black.""  Noooope, never came out of his mouth any of the times he ordered it.By the end of the night, we had about 4 different receipts because we kept finding mistakes with our bill and she had to keep changing it.  It was exasperating and frustrating.

"if you like good service, good food and a nice atmosphere, BJs is not for you. If your number one priority is cheap food and drinks, then this is a good choice. They get one star for the $4.75 patron margarita, but it took over 30 minutes to get it and the first time they brought me a gin and tonic. I was a little worried since it took so long to get my drink in the first place. Even the people who only ordered beers had to wait 30 minutes. They have 1 bartender and don't let the wait staff go behind the bar to get any drinks. They have a decent menu of bar type food and the food was ok, but half of the table had finished their food before the other half got theirs. The group I was with in Vegas loved it though and went every night! I reluctantly went a second time but begged off after that1

I question what this place is a dive bar A sports bar A lounge on one side with pool tables and a liquor store Whatever the case their happy hour is cheap drinks so that's a plus (and what the 1 star is for) other then that the food is good but there's nothing special ( I had the caprese salad), I could make it all for 18 the price and better ingredients. the ambiance is blah and smokey so again my home would be more entertaining. The blonde bartender won't let you get a word out so I recommend you flag someone else down. Good luck with checks, you will have 10 of them at the end of the night with anyone that served you anything.

"I would give this place 0 stars if I could.Right now I am in my room at the Wynn Encore. I taxi'ed out with a few friends all the way to Mandalay bay to experience Red Square.They're earliest closing time is 2am. We arrived at their front door to Red Square at 12:55. THEY WERE CLOSED. Door locked. We saw someone leave so we entered inside. The ladyhostess came up to us, I asked if they were still open. She replied with a rude tone "" no, we're closed"". I asked why they advertised a 2am closing time. She replied quickly ""its clean up hour""Couldn't you clean AFTER 2 am WTF, why don't you post 1am closing on Weds night. Instead of every website listing 2am as a closing time. That is the most unprofessional encounter I've had in Las Vegas. Even hookers have more professionalism than that. Thank you for wasting our time, money and 3 cab rides there.I seriously doubt I'll ever stay at Mandalay Bay, or any of my friends.Thank you Wynn Encore for the comp'ed rooms.

"I loved it when I was there. The staff was very friendly and the decor was so interesting. I had the prawns - they were a bit bland but not awful. Until I woke up with food poisoning. I was so sick I could not move - I had to change my flight out of Vegas and stay an extra day just to recover. Be very careful. The meal was quite expensive and I am disgusted to think of what the kitchen must look like for me to get so sick.

"OKay- first off- this place does have some good martini's and what not, but this review is not for their ownership of good alcohol....it is for the food.  This was not Russian Food.  I came to this place because some one had posted on yelp that they had a true russian menu.  I really didnt see that at all.  Their menu was just like every other food menu in a restaurant in vegas that is trying to be swanky.  Yeah tuna tartare and steak topped with things- you know what I am talking about.So the food was really not russian fare- and the food that we did have wasnt even good!  I got the butterfish dish- i mean u cant really go wrong with butterfish-but they did.  It was disgusting.  It was served in like a bright red sauce- that stained my lips even-so gross.Very disappointing dining experience :(

"Disregard their posted hours because they do too!Wifey and I made the trek from the Hilton, all the way to Mandalay Bay to visit our favorite vodka bar, only to find out that they decided to close an hour early. According to the girl that came rushing to the door, Red Square closes whenever they want depending on how busy they are! Don't advertise your closing time when in reality it doesn't matter at all!

"Went back a week ago to try this place again.  The hostess was rude, lazy and useless and did not fit a ""Russian"" restaurant.  We were ready to spend $150 for two at this place and they could not even do the simple job of making us feel welcomed.

".... Sorry, but the Red Square is not good anymore.  The food is tired and poor quality.  I had the worst lobster bisque in my life.  The Calamari was icky and the main courses were even worse.   They need a refresh...... I feel bad giving it a one star because our server was wonderful.

"I attended a work dinner here at Red Square at Mandalay. The waitstaff was friendly but very inept. They delivered a wine that was two years more recent than ordered and continued to bungle. The stroganoff was not as food as the hamburger helper version. I'd avoid this place, especially for the money.

"I read somewhere that this was the best bar in Las Vegas and when I went to finally try it I don't see how that could be.  It was a Friday night at around 11:30 or 12 am and we were met at the entrance with someone with their hand up saying that they were closed. A bar in Vegas closed at 12 am in Vegas  There were like 20 people in the bar. Long story short I will never go there again.

"China Grill Mgmt sold its stake in Red Square to Light Group, because Mandalay Bay is having Light Group take over  a number of their restaurants in their ""restaurant row"". No more China Grill. No more ""Red White & Blue"". And no more ""happy hours"" or ""specials"", particularly at Red Square.I loved Red Square's ""Cavihour"", a cheap happy hour (cheap for the Strip) where you got a 12 oz of american caviar with the fixin's (blinis, creme fraische, toast points, shallots, it was terrific) for the price of 2 shots (or cocktails) of Russian vodka. It was so much fun. Cheesy, yes, but fun.But tonight, I found out, the Cavihour is dead. As are all happy hours previously run by China Grill Mgmt, at Red Square.We are very sad locals.So long live Cavihour! We shall never return to Red Square.

"I'm not going to rate this for the crowd that it draws since that can change depending on the day of the week.It has a nice rooftop view, but venue decor is not as nice as mix or foundation room.But the main reason for the one star-  we ordered effen raspberry chilled, and the bartender mistakenly (i hope) uses sky vodka, and than adds a little effen raspberry.  When askes about it, she said she knew what she 'knows what she's doing'.  well if she 'knew' what she was doing that's shady, using cheaper vodka and saying it's the better stuff.  And if she made the mistake, why not just own up to it, and at the very least pour new rounds.

Aren't you married with children or something  All that's unecessary dude...And what are you so ""agitated"" about when you got pulled over 2 hours later...That pro you left with didn't give you a rub and tug  The only thing that probably got blown that night was the breathalyzer machine when LVPD pulled your dumbass over and should have arrested you for a DUI or DWB - whichever.

"If you like to support a dishonest staff that tries to get the girls you are with into their club by telling you they'll get your group in free, only to wait for an hour, because of a slow elevator entrance, to be charged full price anyways after they escort your ladies in free, and then go hang out in a sausage fest, then this is the club for you!Heaven forbid anyone in your group insist that they live up to their word either or they'll just call security to come and toss them out.I dont mind paying entrance for a club but I DO mind being hustled and then watching an arrogant staff treat my friend like dirt once he calls them on it.... The one redeeming quality about this club is that it has a great view of the strip but it isnt worth a disorganized staff that cant stay on the same page with each other regarding entrance, a dance floor full of dudes, and just a generally indignant attitude.  I went to Lavo and Rain during my stay and in comparison, I can confidently say I wont be heading back to Moon ever again.
",0
"First, why would you go to this club which has a tiny dancefloor as opposed to Rain.Don't be fooled by the bouncers and doormen here, they will waste your time and feed you lies.  These morons which are probably high school drop outs, are very unprofessional.The promoters at this club should just quit because they need to learn how to have a good girl to guy ratio. Plus, who was the retard that made one of the barriers to the club by coming into an elevator firstSo if you do enjoy this club, you most likely are either getting hustled or prefer hairy cylindrical objects forced in your mouth. Also, my friend who went  to this club got her behind grabbed by a guy who already had a girlfriend.

"I must have been there on a bad night (Sunday) because there were not actually any people there. Even the free bottle of vodka did not help the situation. It did have a good view of the strip, but that only entertained me for about 3 minutes. Drank our vodka and then moved on to Lavo...THAT is where the people were.

"Ok, I know that some people really love this club, but I am not one of those people!  If I had to pay to get in to this club, I would still have asked for my money back.  There was 3 lines that were long as hell (that's to be expected in Las Vegas).  There were several people getting by saying that they knew a guy naed Raul.  The club was over populated and the music was horrible!!!  The most up to date song they played came out in 2002!  Having to go up to the 53rd floor was cool at first, but trying to get down made me feel like a prisoner!  I had 4 girls in my group and they wouldn't let all of us on the elevator.  One person was held back (literally).  We were only there for about an hour.  If you have anything else to do, do it!!!!
",0
"Man, from reading these reviews I really though Moon was gonna be awesome but it sucked.  Maybe it was just an off night there, but it just seemed like a lamer version of Rain (also in the Palms).  It is just one boring room with a dance floor.  We had bought VIP All-Access passes and were told that they basically meant nothing and we had to wait in the line with everybody else (these are the $85 blue wrist bands, don't bother buying them).  Also a bouncer watched a drunk guy basically dump a drink all over me and my boyfriend, and didn't do anything about it.  Then the elevator mass (you could not call it a line) was out of control, but luckily we pushed through and were able to get on the next train out of Moon.  Thank god.

"I usually hit this place on Thursdays which is usually pretty dead.  Went this time on a Friday and it was wack.  I don't know what was up with this crowd, but my friends described it as ""busted guy land.""  I think this guy was trying to slip something in my drink until my husband showed up and he ran away.  I keep giving this place a chance, but I'm done.  Oh and let's not forget the chick fight on the dancefloor...very classy.

"A few weeks ago, a few friends and myself rolled in here to check this place out.  I walked up to the bar and immediately ordered a bottled beer, which cost about 4 bucks which I thought was a little steep. I then proceeded to glance around the bar and almost immediately realized that we had made a poor decision. I'm no xenophobe, but a cursory glance of the bar area led me to believe that I was in the middle of a UN convention in uptown Charlotte.  I have no problems with ""gays and gangbangers"" as reviewer Jason L referenced, but it is definitely not my crowd.The bar is undersized, old, dirty, and generally an undesirable place to congregate.  Other reviews have commented on the attractiveness of the bartenders and I will not deny that, but if your sole reason for going to a bar is for the attractive women that work there, then I recommend going over to the establishment on E. Morehead St.Needless to say, I will not be going back to this place.

"You may end up here on Sat night if all the other area bars are busy.I'm not going to come down too hard on this place because it wasn't my choice to come here. One of the locals led a group of guys here initially just to have 'one shot'. He lives in the Avenue and knows the bar owner and several of the staff.  We got quick and efficient service at a great priceand ended up staying for a few rounds of beers after a round of shots.This place is rough, watch your back, There is a lot of drama and the kind of place where testosterone mixed with alcohol can make for a volatile mix.

"What the hell, Phil's Tavern Every time I come here (usually before a show), things just don't work out. I wanted them to, but they just didn't.FOOD: The only food I've tried here were the jalapano poppers, and then I never tried anything here again. How do you burn something in a deep fryer Normally I'd just be impressed, but I was hungry. DRINKS: Their drink specials are nothing to write home about. The dirty martini was weak, and the tiny, shrivelled, Spanish olives skewerd on a coffee stir did not impress. At least it was only $5. Unfortunately, the Corona of the person I was with only cost fifty cents less than that. $4.50 for a warm Corona Do not want.SERVICE: Nice, but few and far between.ATMOSPHERE: Dank, dirty, sticky... these are only a few of the descriptors for this place. I fear the day where I will have no choice but to use the facilities here.Overall: Don't waste your time and money. I hear there's better places in this area, I just need to find them.

"Paul and Chad could not be more right. This place is THE dive bar of Charlotte. Looks and feels as greasy and grimy as it smells. I had no idea they served food until these reviews mentioned it. I do not even know if they have a bathroom. I frequent a lot of the uptown bars for a few drinks before it's time to go home every weekday. I went to Phil's a total of 3 times. The first time I went I got 2 beers, drank them, attempted to pay but was told they can't run my card without at least $10 ran, so after ordering a shot to bring my bill up to par, I paid and left. I assume this is why a bottled 12oz is $4 and Miller Lite is always on 'special'. No one said anything other than ""hi, whatcha drinkin"", ""another one"" and ""that's all for ya"". The second time, it was trivia night. It seemed fun so I took a few pics of the place, the bartender, people playing trivia and the specials board. I paid for my beers with cash and left. I went back a few days later and was quickly ""greeted"" by the brontosaurus behind the bar. ""I heard you were taking pictures of us the last time you were here. You are not welcome here and need to leave."" Now I've been kicked out of bars before, but it's because I did something wrong (got in a fight, threw up somewhere, etc), so this was a first. There were 2 people at the bar who quickly looked up and started looking me up and down. Thinking there was no good way to explain myself monosyllabically enough for her to understand, I said ""yes ma'am"" and took my leave, laughing at the situation. Everything would have been fine except as I was leaving I overheard her mumble ""pervert"". In hindsight I can see where I may have used poor judgement, or should have asked if it was ok first. And for that I am sorry. But she did not even attempt to speak to me before publicly jumping to conclusions she ""heard"" insinuating I was taking lewd pictures for my own personal pleasure. The bartenders are nothing except a lifeless ordinary, working to earn cash and doing a bad job at trying. There are other establishments near here that offer more for less, with decent conversation and pleasant aromas. For as slow as this place always seemed to be, I can't imagine why the staff are quick to judge. But perhaps that's the normal clientele that frequents this establishment, and I can see why. I obviously will never be back. If you do not want to be looked at and judged when you walk in and then talked about disparagingly when you leave, stay as far away from here as possible. There are MUCH better places that will give you fantastic service, and a conversation for a fraction of your overall cost.

"I'm so over T-Bones.I used to relish the thought of hanging out on their big deck on one of the first warm days of the year, treating myself to their yummy grilled chicken salad or wings--the only 2 things on their menu that I liked.  I was even willing to tolerate the funky smell of the main restaurant on my way out to the deck.  But the last 3 times I've been to T-Bones, the food and service have been awful.  And they changed the menu, removing the grilled chicken breast salad that I liked.  The sweet tea was almost as clear as water, and painfully sweet--undrinkable.I'm sorry, T-Bones.  We tried to make it work, but it takes two.  Please stop relying on the fact that you're the only place (I know of) in the area where you can eat the water's edge.  It's just not enough to keep us coming anymore.  You actually have to serve good food and decent drinks.

"T-Bones is well below average. Starting with the drinks. Tea was very weak and the glasses were very small. Appetizer, hot wings, were mediocre at best. Not hot and sorta greasy. Wife got salad, which was unimpressive and a little wilted. Wife had filet, which she described as  a poor cut of meat, tough with gristle. I got a ribeye, if you could call it that. It appeared to be pan fried, as is was greasy. It was a very poor cut of meat, with much fat and gristle. Sweet potato was good, except it was very small.   Service was good, as we were in a group of 12.  Glasses were kept full and service prompt. Cost is hard to believe! You pay for a choice cut of meat and get Waffle House food.  I went to this place probably 15 years ago. Was not impressed then. Has gotten worse. Not inclined to go to places were they have to have armed police officers on duty for the protection of their patrons.   This placed is off the list. Will not return!

"Service was good, but food NOT.  You don't realize how awful the food really is until about 30 minutes after you have eaten it.  5 of us eat there tonight, we each had different items, pasta, fish and chips, potato skins, combination of vegetable sides, a sandwich, and other items.   Everything was GREAZY and salty.  But you don't realize how much grease until 15-30 minutes after eating when your skin gets oily, you feel sludgy, thirsty, and loose your energy.  I don't know what grease or ingredients they use, but it's terrible.  We all went home after and didn't feel like doing anything after this.I've been there before for beer on the deck, the beer is good, but don't eat the food.  Contrary to many of the other reviews, the service was very good.  Meghan was our waitress.

"Unfortunately this is the only place on Lake Wylie to eat when you are out on your boat other than a snack bar. The deck and the boat docks are the only reason they are still in business. If you want a drink order beer or wine. The drinks are watered down and shots are limited because the premium liquor selections are limited.  The food leaves a lot to be desired.  We ordered the smoked chicken quesadilla, mozzarella cheese sticks and a burger because we thought it would be hard to mess that up. We were wrong.  The chicken had some artifical smoke flavor added and that was the only flavor.  The filling ingredients were not evenly distributed so there were areas overloaded and areas with nothing. The cheese sticks were a lukewarm frozen product, the marina was much hotter and appears to be a frozen product nuked in little cups because the plastic was melting.  The hamburger was not seasoned and mediocre.  The fries were mushy and limp.   On top of all this the place appears grungy and dated.  The place is falling apart and obviously being run into the ground in an attempt to just milk every possible dime out of it. This is the last chance we are giving this place.  Hopefully everyone will also give up on it so a decent place can be moved in, but I think the building is beyond saving at this point.

"I never realized how gross this place was, until I went sober with a group of 13 from work. Yes, it is great to be on the lake, but the place needs some major renovations. The inside smells horrible... like old and soggy and dusty. I ordered a salad with salmon which was disgusting. I think the salmon took on the flavor of the smell of the inside which was nasty. I have enjoyed the chicken quesadilla and drinks before, but that's about it. Actually, I forgot, their Sunday brunch is pretty good and they do a bloody Mary bar that is good too. Don't take a large group because they act like accommodating you is painful. They also took forever when the restaurant seemed fairly dead. They need to remodel and hire a new chef to re-write the menu because you cannot beat the location. They also need more boat slips... it always fills up fast on the weekend!

"Disappointed! Menu looked good but very expensive. The food was average. I can see no justification for their prices. Our main entrees were delivered to the table before our appetizer and salads.

We won't be coming back unless we have to, and if we do, we'll make sure we eat somewhere else first.

"Horrible service.  We went for ""Taco Tuesday.""  We waited for nearly 15 minutes before walking up to the bar to ask if we could get some service.  ""I thought you were helped"" the lady grunted at me as she took our order.  She was the only bar keep in the place.  Must have an Alzheimer's style memory. Nearly 10 minutes later our drinks showed up.  We witnessed others get their food that had ordered after we did.  We ordered the taco special, so being ""Taco Tuesday,"" one would think these would be readily available.  Finally after 12 hour, we got our food tossed on the table.  The personable waitress didn't notice our drinks were empty, so I had to walk the glasses to the bar to get them refilled.  While waiting quietly, some Harley- riding local came in and he was greeted like royalty.  He barged right in front of me and he got served pronto. The bar tender went to him like files to a fresh pile of doo.   Thanks.Looks like the only way you'll get served here is if you are known by the employees, ride a Harley, have more tattoos than stripper convention or poor hygiene.The food was decent. At  $5.75 for a taco, the price was awesome.  I'd go back if it weren't for the lousy service.  Maybe I should buy  a new Electra-Glide next time I want a taco.

"I had gone to Eagles crest for lunch a few times and decided to take my family, from out of town, one weekend. When we arrived, there was a sign on the front door saying that it was customer appreciation day. We Bought a round of drinks and found a table to sit at. Other patrons were going through the food line which was set up at the pool table.  But my sister-in-law went To get a veggie plate, One of the female staff came from around the bar and slapped the plate out of her hand And told us that we were not welcome there. We finished our drinks and left. As we were leaving we checked the sign on door again to see if it was marked private party, but it was not.

"If I could give the Harmony less than one star, I would. I live in the Shenk-Atwood neighborhood, so I'm not writing as an outsider. I've been to the Harmony many times, but I'm finally done being abused by the notoriously unfriendly owner, bartenders and waitstaff at the Harmony. The Harmony is worse than Seinfeld's Soup Nazi because there's no irony or humor in being treated the way the employees here treat their customers. I won't get into specifics. I can only say that I take pride in my neighborhood. My wife and I frequent those establishments that understand that they are part of a community and treat their paying customers as such. The Harmony is a black mark on our neighborhood, and I am ashamed that unsuspecting visitors to the quaint east side should have to endure the abusive, disrespectful and generally unapologetic service at this establishment. If you scroll down you'll read other comments about the owner's girlfriend who is now manager. The last time I was in there with a group of friends, she couldn't have been more rude or insulting. When we all said we wouldn't be back, she merely shrugged her shoulders. If you're visiting the East Side, there are plenty of other places that serve great food with friendly service. Alchemy, Mickey's, Wilson's, The Weary Traveller all come to mind as places that will make you feel and taste the love on the East Side.  If you're a masochist, be sure to head on over The Harmony for your daily dose of abuse. You've been warned. You certainly won't catch me sitting at this bar ever again.

"The unfriendly atmosphere at The Harmony Bar is its biggest failing.  At first I thought it was just sarcastic ""Soup Nazi"" humor, but soon realized that the prevalent hostile attitude there is genuine and that it trickles down from management to employees, customers, and even performers.  I've seen bar managers there either berate customers directly or berate the bartenders who then have to try very hard not to pass that negativity on to customers.Also, it's downright embarrassing to be an audience member there when the bar mistreats the band.  I once saw a Harmony bar manager preempt an encore performance by turning on the overhead lights, jumping up on the stage, and literally grabbing the mike from a performer to announce that the show's over and that everybody has to finish their drinks and leave.  I was floored.  It was the first time I'd ever seen anyone kick a band off the stage just because they wanted to close their bar early.  The kitchen staff works hard, and the food is decent.  Unfortunately, this is the only bar I've ever been to in Madison where I've been asked to pay for my dinner tab up front.  (There are lots of other bars that also don't take credit cards, but they still let you run a tab.) It made me wonder if they didn't trust me to close out my tab or if they were hoping my tip would be better prior to experiencing their poor service.In short, even on occasions when they book national acts, it's not worth going there if you're going to encounter hostility when you want something from the bar.  There are too many other fun places to go in Madison for anyone to have to put up with the miserable buzz killing atmosphere that prevails at The ""Harmony"".

The other groomsmen and I had to follow up repeatedly to get an answer as to when our tuxedos would arrive and the staff were very short with our honest questions over the phone.2- They sent two of our tuxedos to Homestead when we asked for them to be sent to Ross Park Mall during the fitting.3- When one of us called two days prior to the wedding to ask if our tux's had arrived the guy answering the phone said ""Oh... I don't know"" (insert an awkward, pregnant pause here while waiting for him to say ""Let me check that for you"") he instead said ""Well, I'm going to hang up now.""  And he made good on that promise, and hung up.4- Despite saying we'd get a call a few weeks ahead of the wedding to be resized in case one of us gained a few lbs over the winter, this call never came so we basically had to hope that everything fit as it needed to.5- We were at one point informed that MW had our emails on file and that when our tuxes arrived at the store we would receive an email letting us know.  Not a single groomsman received any such email to that effect.6- One of the groomsmen randomly received a black tie while everybody else had white.  Another received no studs.  We discovered this approximately two hours to show-time while relatively far from civilization.7- On picking up my tux I informed the associate ""I'll be unable to get to a Men's Wearhouse for a few days after the wedding, is this alright"" to which she responded ""Yeah that should be fine"" so when my girlfriend graciously dropped off my tux for me a few days later and learned of the $100 late fee, I was totally caught off guard.8- My girlfriend was also caught totally off guard by the associate at Ross Park Mall who was incredibly rude to her when  he informed her of said late fee.9- As the Best Man I was given a coupon card for $50 off my next rental at Men's Wearhouse.  Since I am in another wedding next month with rentals from MW I figured this would be an opportune time to use it.  Imagine my shock while paying for the next weddings rental, when I presented the coupon and was told ""Oh, that isn't for this.  That is intended for YOUR wedding.  Oh and it expires on December 31st of this year."" 10- The groom himself decided to use a coupon to purchase a suit for the wedding and to own, rather than rent a tux for the occasion.  He was ensured by the Homestead staff that the coupon would be fine for this purpose and got fitted for it.  When he went to pick up his suit and pay with the aid of said approved coupon he was instead forced into an argument with an associate who insisted he could not use the coupon towards the suit that an associate a few weeks earlier had insisted he could use.  Granted, now I am speaking for another person so take that with as much salt as you may, but he reiterated this fact to me several times prior to his wedding last week.Over my friends wedding weekend, any time anything even went slightly wrong at and around his wedding, the joke between the Groom and his Groomsmen was ""Effing Men's Wearhouse.""  For example, at a restaurant, ""Wait I asked for no onions on this sandwich. - Effing Men's Wearhouse!""  ""Noise complaint at the hotel room Men's Wearhouse.""Another groomsman looked at me when we discovered the wrong color tie one of us received and said to me ""I hope you're taking notes for your own impending wedding"" to which I replied ""Perhaps I could find better service from GoodWill of Western PA""Congrats Men's Wearhouse.  You became the butt of every joke for every mishap for an entire weekend around a wedding to which you provided the suits.TL;DR - 10 mistakes, several rude associates and 1 future groom going to Jos. A. Bank.

"Ick.  Stay away unless you want to be treated like you are a criminal who cannot afford a pricey item.  I wanted to try on a $400 fur...and the guy said it was very expensive and would hand carry it to the front mirror for me.  He then advised me to take off my vest and waited for me to do so.  He would not let me handle the coat myself because it was ""very expensive.""  He watched me while I tried it on and then immediately took it off me.  I wanted to tell him that $400 wasn't pricey for a winter coat and that I could easily afford it, but decided to walk out without purchasing it.  I won't be back.

"So help me God, if I ever get married or have a sex change and need a tuxedo, I am never coming to this Men's Warehouse again.We unluckily got helped by Morgan to get fitted for a wedding my boyfriend is in this upcoming July. From the get go, the gum-chewing-lip-smacking Morgan was completely lacking in anything remotely close to customer service. We arrived with a coupon from David's Bridal for $40 off a tux rental and was met with the realization that it was for Prom only (despite the small print not saying Prom only rentals). When I told her where we'd gotten the code, she agreed that yes, a $40 coupon was in David's Bridals free catalogs at the store, but she was unable to use any coupon codes to get the discount.So let me go over this: I have a coupon. Give coupon. Not valid on this transaction, but there are other coupons in the same place you got this. I don't have that coupon. Sorry cannot help you even though I know that coupon exists and the code is simply DBAW and 6 numbers.Wow, wow and wow. Some of you out there might be saying ""Well, you have the wrong coupon and even if the fine print didn't say prom only, it's what it was and too bad"" but here's the thing: CUSTOMER SERVICE. Customer service means service with a smile (no smile on Morgan but sloppy dress and bra showing, check!). Customer Service means going above and beyond (perhaps giving us a working coupon to use). Customer service means using your brain and not being a complete idiot when it comes to common sense.So, what did I do when she rang up the charge full price I called David's Bridal in NorthLake and got AMAZING customer service by the first person who picked up who was glad to tell me the current wedding coupon code, which I told to an apathetic Morgan. Me - 1, Her - 0. Chick, you don't even know the lengths I will go to so that we can save money with or without your horrible help.And what's a cake without icing Totally watched a dude smoke in front of the store and then come in and measure my boyfriend for the tux without washing his hands. Hands, cigarette, mouth, touching customers. YUCK!

"My groomsman and I bought the suits for my wedding here. 4 of us that I know were sized wrong.  Customer service was terrible. After we purchased our suits they would not correct it.  Highly recommend not buying a suit here.  These people do not know what they're doing.
",0
"I have been here on multiple occasions and each time the customer service leaves a lot to be desired. Their selection in 38s-40s seems pretty limited. I've been twice now when I was looking for a particular color  style. When asked if I needed any assistance, the answer to ""yes, I'm looking for x type of jacket in x color"" should not be to say, ""hold on a few minutes while I"" do something and then to leave your customer waiting 10+ min for an answer.Save yourself the hassle and go check out, pretty much anywhere else. I hear they sell jackets and suits at the thrift stores. At least there I'm expecting to be ignored and have to fend for myself when trying to find something.

"WORST EXPERIENCE EVER. We went to men's warehouse thinking it would be an easy accessible place to rent tuxes for our small wedding party of 3 plus the groom. When we went in to inquire about rentals we were told that it was cheaper to buy which we thought was weird but we decided to trust the sales associate and buy which ended up costing over $200 per suit after alterations. When we bought my husbands suit, who was the groom we paid a deposit plus the fee to rent all shirts and ties. When our grooms party went in to pick up shirts and ties they were charged for something we had already paid for. The best-man was called to pick up his suit, saying all alterations were done, when in fact the pants weren't even started. The tailor job was awful and fit him horrible, I'm assuming since they had to rush the hemming. We requested all items to be transferred to one store, and of course none if it had been, leaving us scrambling around town trying to get things together. Awful customer service, no one knew anything when our party came in, tried to over charge us when we had our receipts. GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. Not worth the crappy service, crappy tailor job and definitely not worth the stress on your wedding day.

"Waited for 10 minutes to be told there was a sign up list in the corner about 20 feet away in the opposite direction. After another 30 minutes of waiting some lady walked up that was NOT on the list, said she was here about 30 mins (I'm at 40 mins now) and the guy started helping her for her sons prom. What is the point of the list again

"When we went in for the fitting everything was fine, they had to make some adjustments and a button was missing from my best man's jacket. No problem they made those corrections and sewed the button back on. They also mentioned that they were going to put our pocket squares in for us. Well they didn't. 2 of the 3 of us didn't have pocket squares which were listed on the receipt and on the list of items that should have been included. And of course since we had already completed our fitting we didn't notice this until we were getting dressed for the wedding. We were told they were being put into our jackets and were let down. Fortunately we had time to run by a department store and purchase new pocket squares since the wedding wasn't close to a Mens Wearhouse location. But of course that was an added expense we thought we had taken care of. Also as we're getting dressed my best man's button came right back off again. The one that was supposed to be sewed on as the time of the fitting. So that was disappointing as well. All of the pictures that he is in wearing his jacket look a bit off. Clearly not everyone will notice it but on a day where I wanted everything to be perfect it wasn't. I don't believe for any future tuxedo rentals I'll be returning to a MW as well as I don't believe I'd recommend it. I just hope any future grooms or groomsmen don't have the same issues.""

"My husband rented a suit for our wedding.  A couple days before the wedding he went to pick it up and they had the wrong suit.  My husband is 6'2 and they had been shipped a suit for a man who was only 5'10.  Furthermore, their idea of fixing it was giving him a different shirt suit then the one he picked out months ago.  The women was extremely rude to me when I told her that I thought that was unacceptable and replied starkly that ""mistakes happen"".  I told her that it was her responsibility as an employee to fix the mistake.  After 45 minutes (if you've ever had a wedding then you know there are a zillion other things you could be doing in 45 minutes three days before the wedding) of her being rude and rolling her eyes at me, she finally got her boss to help us.  He gave my husband a new shirt (one that was not a rental) and just asked that my husband return it after the wedding, which he did.  I mean, was that really that hard for them to figure out how to make THEIR mistake right

"I read a few negative reviews from other unhappy customers but I thought I would try this place out anyway. When I arrived my wife and I met Alladin, shop owner, who seemed very confident. He said he worked with pro athletes and sounded like he knew what he was talking about. He tried selling me a suit and said it would be worth the money. Later I purchased an $800 Hugo Boss suit and came back to see him to have it altered. He made all of the necessary markings and pinned the back of the jacket to be altered. A week later I came with my wife to pick up the suit and he handed me the wrong suit (good thing I checked). He didn't ask me to try the right one on so I asked if I could make sure it fit. Long story short, he never altered the jacket and the pants seam was off. He tried to charge $200 for doing nothing to the jacket which is a scam. He finally agreed to fix the jacket so sent us to lunch and made some adjustments. He didn't know how to work with the modern Hugo Boss material and you could see the stitching marks from the hem on the outside of the pants legs . WHAT A JOKE! I was going to seek legal advice but figured I would spend more on a lawyer than just making the ruined suit work. If you need anything complicated done or if you are have anything of value do not use this guy! PLEASE BEWARE and don't ignore these complaints like I did. There are other negative reviews out there if you look.

"I payed $70 to get 4 pairs of pants tailored here, 3 pairs of BCBG slacks and a pair of True Religions. So I thought, not a bad price for expensive pants and everyone loves this guy. Not a single one was the right length that I asked. The hem fell out of one pair already and the tailor didn't even do what I asked for on another. To top it off, the chalk marks weren't even washed or steamed out!!! I am so appalled by his craftsmanship. I will never go back after I get them fixed...

"I took several dresses and shirts in to this person before a long business trip. It was VERY expensive, but he seemed competent. However, on the trip, I discovered that one of my dresses wasn't completed, and the pins in the shoulders were left in! On the phone he offered me a full refund ($40). When I picked up my now completed dress a week later, he only offered me a $10 credit and then shooed me out of his store. I tore it up right there and vowed never to go back.

"Extremely poor customer service - the owner lied to me when I came to pick up my clothing and it wasn't ready. That was after calling the night before and getting attitude for inquiring before he originally said it would be ready. There's nothing special about this place.

"Horrible customer service. I went in for the first visit for alterations and they were very standoffish. When picking up the pants, I noticed the zipper had been broken. I brought this to their attention and they refused to fix the zipper or reimburse me for a repair. It was obvious that the damage was done at their shop because the pants were brand new. Also, I would NOT have walked out of the dressing room and proceed to be fitted with a zipper down. The owner proceeded to argue with me when I asked him to at least reimburse me for the tailoring, and kept this up for about 10 minutes. He said he could fix the zipper, but out of principle he would not do anything to the pants. He said that he had many high end clients and did not need one patron's business.  Very disappointed, will never return.

"I read a couple of the negative reviews but decided to get my Hugo Boss suit altered anyway. I was lied to, over charged, I was given the wrong suit, the jacket was not altered when I finally got the right one, pants fabric bunched up where alterations were made and to top it off i was treated like it was no big deal. I would avoid the guy if you have anything worth value. Maybe okay for a pair of jeans or sweat pants. No apology given after the mess. There are too many professionals out there to go to who know what they are doing and who will treat you respectfully so don't go here. Hopefully this helps you.

"Crime is a problem!  I had my phone and keys stolen from me while I was in the pool at Dowd.  My babysitter had her car broken into in the Dowd parking lot as well. Both of these events took place within the last 2 months.  It is not worth working out at a place where you and your property are unsafe.

"Wait 20 mins to get a parking spot then wait 15 for a machine no thanks. Just cancelled and move to Fitness Connection for $10 bucks a month. For that price I can go to a swanky yoga studio on the weekends and still be cheaper than the Y. This place is seriously over sold. Stop selling more memberships when you don't have enough space or equipment to accommodate current members. Serious over crowding issue.

"Its all about the money, and really who goes through medical school if its not about the big cash.  Healing and helping people cannot possibly be the motivation.I had my gallbladder removed by Dr. Francis Teng. My 2 insurances were billed $26,000. Thankfully, (not) my out of pocket was only $320 and $210 to the anesthicialogist who happens to be Tengs brother and $35 to Rosa Teng (office manager) for a one page return to work form.My return visit after the surgery was about 10 seconds long. I was still asking him  questions when he was shaking my hand and leading me out of the office. Rosa his sister and office manager is so rude. The word rude doesn't describe how awful this woman is.   She is snarky, smartass, pretentious and full of smartass comments. She handles all the insurance and copay fees. She will nickle and dime you, so be sure you contact your insurance to make sure you get the right coverage and no extra fees.  By the way he does single incision surgery, he promises no scar, well mine healed horribly, its what they call a keloid scar and its about and inch long right under my bellybutton.  Go to a different doctor. Or ask any medical professional in the las vegas area and everyone seems to agree with the bad bedside manner of Dr. Francis Teng and the unprofessional office assistant  Rosa.

"Back in January I had to have my gall bladder removed which was a very unexpected and scary surgery for someone like me who has only ever had my wisdom teeth out. I was referred to Dr. Teng's office by a friend of mine who had the weight loss surgery that is his bread and butter. I should have waited for the doctor who I was referred to in the ER to have an opening but I was in a ton of pain and wanted to have the surgery as soon as possible. It was no surprise that my liver was inflamed and that Dr. Teng said it was the worst gall bladder case he has ever seen, but at least he got it out and although I now have an 8 inch scar it was worth it to no longer be in the kind of pain I was experiencing.I too had to pay a deposit before the surgery which I did and then six months after the surgery I received a sizable bill. I couldn't understand why after the deposit and my insurance company pitching in he was still expecting me to pay almost $800! With the ER bills leading up to the surgery taxing our finances as well you can imagine I was not thrilled. My husband tried calling the office at least three times to get the scoop on the bill. When it came in the mail it looked sketchy with no actual descriptive information on it. I could have designed a more legitimate looking invoice on my own computer! We wanted to know what we were paying for exactly and why the balance was so much. After three phone calls my husband had still not heard back from the office yet they continued to send out invoices threatening to slap us with a late payment. Honestly, who does not return phone calls!! If you are a business it is what you do! We were very frustrated.Finally my husband got ahold of Dr. Teng's head secretary or office manager who seems to think very highly of herself. She was very unhelpful and wouldn't answer his questions besides telling him to contact our insurance provider. Again, what kind of business practice is thisWe paid our bills and hopefully that's the end of it.

"I agree with Veronika O. Dr Teng's office managersister is the nasiest, rudest and most arrogant  person I've dealt with in the medical field. It's amazing he still has a practice with the way his office is run. Even the staff at Mountainview Hospital don't want to deal with her. When I had surgery there and they needed a form from his office, they asked me to call because they didn't want to deal with her. i also told my family Dr never to refer him again. There are other surgeons, find someone else.

"There are lots of businesses that do what they do.    I recommended that you do plenty of homework before doing business with Neos Medspa.   They moved to their new location from their mall location for a reason.     If you have a problem, the doctor that oversees the practice does not call you back.     Think twice before getting a B12 from them.   Ask lots of questions and then go find someone else to get one from.   It's just not worth the risk.

"Other people may have had a better experience with this company but that was not the case for us.  We had rented a limobus for a bachelor party.  Our driver Scott, was completely clueless in navigating the city. Constantly making wrong turns and missing exits. All of this after very thorough instruction as to where to go. Each destination took 3-4 times longer to reach due to his incompetence. This caused us to have to skip a couple of our originally planned stops. After returning to the bus after one of our stops we were informed by Scott that the police had come onto the bus and searched it with dogs. Really!!  Why!!  How!!  We found that our bags had been rifled through and we all felt a little violated and confused. By this point we decided to call it a night. More than half of our passengers didn't care to step back onto the bus and took cabs home. Just when we thought the worst was over we were wrong. As we enter the highway we realize that Scott has driven all the way up the ramp and onto the highway going THE WRONG WAY!!!  He starts slowly reversing down the ramp while oncoming cars honk and swerve all around us!  Truly terrifying. After that, we were very upset and just wanted to get home. So after several more wrong turns we finally get home. Absolutely terrible night. So if you'd like to book a party bus that will include a geographically blind driver, unecessary police involvement, a near death experience and just an overall sense of frustration mixed with panic then go with these guys. Otherwise, I would suggest staying far, far away!

"OMG who wrote the review below A big fat liarsomeone that was paid to write that! I stayed there for an hour this past weekend (my friend and I were both intoxicated and figured laying down a few hours would get us better suited to finish driving home). This place looks like it hasb't been cleaned (or furnished) since the 80s. Literally there was grime on the walls, and squashed, unwiped bug smears too. Ok, so not the best, but for two hours, we could deal. We looked for bed bugs, and didn't see any immediate signs of them- so we laid down to rest. After about 20-30 minutes, we both started itching like crazy. I ran to the bathroom mirror (there was mold all over the bathroom) and saw bed bug bites all on my shoulders, arms, and legs. HORRIBLE!! PLEASE Health Department, shut them down! It's deplorable in there!!

"If I could give negative stars I would. After this review, I'm writing the president of AA and if action is not taken to correct the disservice at this location, I will never be a AAA member again. (been one since 1999) I recently moved from TN and needed to transfer my title and register my Dodge Ram in PA.  This process is costly regardless of where you go, but adding $36+ for every transaction makes AAA the most expensive.  I'm willing to pay for people to deal with this inconvenience for me, but AAA has made it worse than going to the DMV.  Each and every clerk at this location is incompetent, uneducated, and aloof. I should know, I've dealt with at LEAST a dozen. Go to the DMV.For my very simple transaction, I've had to return to this location 7 (yes that is SEVEN!) times, and it still is not resolved. They've forgotten to request the title from my lien holder, issued the wrong plate for my vehicle, neglected to inform me of steps required by the state... I mean seriously, why would you pay $36 for EACH visit, just to get it wrong. Go to the DMV!Why did you return there if you were so unhappy, you might ask.  Well once you begin the process at one branch, you cannot transfer to any other branch. (We went to Monroeville to transfer my wife's car and it took 30 minutes, ONCE.) Go to Monroeville, or cancel your AAA membership and go to the DMV!!Oh, and 30 minutes that's a dream... I'm waited between 45 minutes and 3.5 HOURS at the East Liberty AAA. Prepare to take the day of work... nay, the WEEK in order to complete any transaction at this facility. Go to the DMV!!!!It has now been over 5 months since I started this process and it's still up in the air. they don't know what I still need to do, but they are happy to keep charging me to figure it out.  Save yourself hundreds of dollars and a weeks worth of lost wages and just GO TO THE DMV!!!!!!!! Yeah it might seem sterile and slow, but at least they aren't serial criminals. It'll be over with like waking up from a bad dream, instead of the reoccurring nightmare that is the East Liberty AAA.Oh, and if you think this is a harsh review... Call their number, 412-365-7196. 9 times out of 10 it just rings and rings.. once I timed it for more than 30 minutes before I got an answer (with no apology).  If you are in the AAA, you'll know I'm calling.  It's the constant ring in the background that NOBODY answers.

"I really wanted to like this place. Great reviews and a renovated priory--what a great idea! The pictures on the website are beautiful.We found a grumpy old man at the front desk, and he could not have been less interested in our arrival. It felt like we were disturbing him to ask for our room key. But the fun started when we returned later in the evening. We found the rollaway we had requested (and paid for) not present, and I went back down to the old gentleman. He stared at me and then went back to pecking at his computer. I waited. Suddenly he looked up at me and started yelling, something to the effect that there wasn't anything that he could do, and that he would see if someone could do something but probably not. He also angrily admitted that the reservation did show the rollaway.I slunk away with my guest who had by now come down, too, embarrassed and insulted. It shouldn't be this way. If this is personalized service, I'd rather stay at a motel.Even without grumpy old man, there's nothing special about this place. The rooms were ok, but the bathrooms tiny (I guess they should be called showerrooms). Everything else was sub-par. The dining room breakfast was served in was tacky and the coffee awful. We did not dare try the free wine. The hotel is in a bad neighborhood.For the money, find a special at the William Penn on the Omni Hotels website. If you want a boutique hotel, try the Inn on the Mexican War Streets--a beautiful building with friendly owners just across from the National Aviary and that beautiful park. The Priory does not feel boutique and is not worth the hassle.Priory, get grumpy old man out of a customer-facing role.

"We stayed here and was initially disappointed-- being new to town, our first impression was that Pittsburgh was a very very bad town full of homeless and degenerates (the area, I find out later, is one of the worst spots in the city!).  The hotel is located across the street from a housing authority building.  Projects  UGH.  Great.  Then we were put into a ""historical"" room that was similar to that of a rundown cheap apartment-- old shower stall, moldy threadbare carpeting, lumpy squeaky bed.  I find out an hour later (after freaking out about the lo-end aspect of this room) that they have new rooms that were just recently renovated.  I asked to see the room, and then ultimately change to that room-- for a fee, of course.  About 50% more expensive.  But I pay more because NO WAY would I be able to exist in this old ""historical"" creepy room.  Finally, a regular room-- the ""renovated"" room was similar to that of an acceptable hotel room.  Why even keep this historical, old, dingy, dirty room  Do they figure unsuspecting people who don't know any better will just accept it bc they have no other choice I slept well in the ""new"" renovated room, and would have been freaked out all night in the old room. What a difference. Actually, the bed and linens were very, very comfortable.  The bathroom was nice and clean.  The room was what I expected a hotel room to be... not high end four seasons, but not cheap and nasty either. The hotel obviously had availabilities of the new, renovated rooms, so why put us in an old, unrenovated, ugly old apartment looking room If they believed in upgrading, then they would have at least gotten repeat business!! For those who are going to book here, pay more for the new rooms, or go somewhere else.  The option of staying in the old room should not be an option at all.  I don't think I will ever go back here if I ever go back to Pittsburgh.  I will stay at a chain hotel-- marriot or whatever.  What is money except a means to be comfortable and live  I will spend more next time.Breakfast was ""eh"".  It was free-- small stations of some fruit, cheese, small pastries, cereal, yougurt and two hot items:  sausage + bacon.  OJ, Cranberry, Milk and Coffee also available.  Honestly, I felt like I was in college, and watching my pennies (poor), staying here...

"Was at a beautiful wedding.  Staff was terrible, unpleasant, and the two slobs at the front desk need to be in the back with their people skills.

"We decided to have a little staycation at the Priory earlier this month.  My husband made the reservation with a special they were having for a dinner date night.  With the special, they give you a few Pittsburgh restaurants to choose from and you get a $50 voucher to that restaurant.  When my husband called the Priory, they said they would make the reservations and call us back on the time.  We never got a call about the reservation time which was annoying.  But the main issue was we checked in, talked to the girl at the front desk about having the shuttle take us to this reservation at Meat and Potatoes, and she set us up with the shuttle.  We go in the room, look around for the $50 voucher, and it's not in the room so we assumed (i know we should never assume) that it was taken care of with Meat and Potatoes when they  made our reservation.  We had a fabulous dinner at M&P, great food, great service, and the bill comes.  We asked the server about this Priory $50 voucher and he had never heard about it so the manager comes over and says they didn't give them anything but to have them call and ask for him and he'll work it out.  We called the Priory and told them this, the girl who answered gave us an attitude and said you should have asked for it.  Then refused to call M&P to talk to the manager.  She just said to pay the full bill and we can work it out when we get back to the hotel.  We gave the manager our phone and he was yelled at as well about this.  He took our word that the Priory would deliver it to him the next day and he deducted the $50 from our bill.  It was embarrassing and it wasn't the issue with the money, just the service with the priory.  This showed us two things: We won't be going back to the Priory due to the lack of service and lack of respect and we WILL be going back to M&P because their service was impeccable.

I saw the reviews & ignored them because I figured I'd be drunk and happy enough to dive into a bed.I checked in around 2am, the girl who checked me in barely said anything to me besides ""initial here and sign here and your room is over there"". The room smelt like hot dogs, the AC wasn't working at all so I was dripping in sweat all night, none of the lamps worked at all, there were holes in the pillow cases and bedding, there was a tiny blood stain on the sheet, I went down for the continental breakfast at 9:30am (it ends at 10am) and they already stopped serving, the shower was ice cold. I then checked for bed bugs after realizing the shithole I spent the night in last night (coast is clear). I checked out and went back to Baltimore, which seems like heaven on earth compared to Shittsburgh.

"BED BUGS!!! Horrible place! DO NOT STAY HERE!! Stayed here for a wedding we attended. Woke up in the middle of the night with bites all over my legs, arms, and back. We flip a pillow over and there it was. BED BUGS. We had to cut our trip short. The man at the front desk apologized and gave us the managers name and number and told us to call back later that morning. We have been calling since 810 and have yet to receive a call back. Such disrespect. We risk bringing back bed bugs and spending hundreds on extermination fees and no has the decency to call back.

"This used to be the Holiday Inn and now it is the Clarion Hotel & Conference Center.  We needed to find a place not too far from Heinz Stadium for a reasonable price. We paid about $90 per night for this place, and the experience started poorly. We walked in and the two lobby TVs were tuned to Judge Judy (for the front desk employee's viewing pleasure). Employees watching reality TV during business hours really puts me off. It was hard to get the attention of the front desk staff because they were in the middle of a pizza order.  Two of the staff was working the front desk with a third suggesting toppings. It was pretty funny as one of clerks started to set up our room while another on the phone to the pizzeria kept interrupting the process with pizza questions. To the side the third clerk assisted with the pizza order. My wife pointed out her extreme cleavage, but I did not want to get lost there. We had a hard time understanding our clerk setting up the room. She tended to mumble, but did assert herself better when responding to pizza order questions. We finally got our room and headed up the very scary elevator to the 4th floor. In a way I felt as if we were at some sort of slum. I kept looking for gang tagging. The room was adequate (and I believe this was a renovated room), but a Motel 6 would be an upgrade. Whoever is doing the renovation has really poor taste and the quality of work is terrible. The swimming pool was a swamp (I am not kidding), but I am sure the frogs living in it were having a good time. The next morning we went down to the front desk again. This time the morning clerk was on a personal call and gave me an angry look because she felt that I was interrupting her call.  She did not even hang up; she just put the phone to her side, answered my question, and then continued her conversation. Personally, I think this hotel would be great for a horror movie and Hollywood should contact this place. It needs to be knocked down, or management should tighten up the staff and improve construction quality. If construction is on track (and I suspect something is wrong), get staff that really is gracious to customers. There are people that need jobs out there and I assure you with proper management they will do a great job. Don't stay here for over $45 per night (the price is due to the breakfast offered). Personally I would not stay here until they fix the place, but for some reason I don't feel that it will ever happen. Something just feels wrong. Perhaps Clarion has stopped the remodel due to the economy.

"Umm lol so seriously I read some reviews about this place and was like NOOOO it can't be that bad. HA HA....DUDE! So this spot is like mad cheap but REALLY First we check in and notice the are undergoing some much needed renovations. Checkin was seamless as it should be. We get to out room 122 and after reading the reviews I know to check the beds immediately. The first bed legit has hair under the sheets...strike 1. As I'm pulling the covers back on the second bed I find two quarters...that's right folks! Obviously left by the last guest intentionally to warn the next occupants that the SHEETS HAVEN'T BEEN CHANGED...let alone checked. I mean really You couldn't at lease have made it look like you did your jobsWe go to the desk and make them aware of the issue. They apologetically get us another room. This room is better its evident by the way these beds were made that the room has been cleaned. The elevator by the desk is stuck on the 3rd floor lol death trap so we take the stairs. Thank God for yelp....You've all been warned lol SERIOUSLY!

"This was technically the Clarion hotel so I think the name is wrong on the page. I'd like to start by saying that I'm not much of a complainer, but if could have given 0 stars, I would have. So we are on our way up to room when we passed a vending machine with water underneath it. I assumed it was leaking and brushed it off. I don't care that much about little things like that especially since we were just sleeping there. After a great hockey game and a bar crawl, we came back to the hotel and got ready for bed. There was absolutely no hot water for my shower. So cold I wouldn't even consider hopping in really quick. It was late so I let it go and decided to try again in the morning. When I woke up it was the same thing. At this point I was fuming. I NEED a shower man!So I put on my angry pants and headed down the hall towards the elevator. Right in front of the elevator door there is a water fall pouring out of the ceiling from the third floor. ""What the hell...."" is pretty much what I was thinking at this point. Well there was my shower considering I had to walk through it to continue on my quest. As soon as the elevator doors open to the first floor, I see the hallway is flooded. The carpet is squishing beneath my feet all the way to the front desk where other angry people had beaten me to. Apparently a pipe had burst the day before and they had neglected to tell us that when we had checked in. I was so mad. I managed to get 70% off our bill and I made her call to check us in at another hotel. I would have insisted the whole bill be paid for but I'm really bad at being mean to people. All in all, I will never stay here or any other branch of this hotel again.

"Nightmare.  It's a ghost town. Needles in parking lot. ""Lobby"" is a hotel room with undesirables hanging around. Asked to see our rooms before checking in, given the key, room was filthy.  Saw a sticky note re: bedbugs.  Bolted, as fast as possible.

"I'm not sure I can even give this place one star. To be fair, the room we had was clean and comfortable. It did seem as if we had entered a time warp, though. Furnishings and bedding from the 70's...if not 60's! I've seen this place rated up to 3 stars on some websites. I'd like to know their qualifications!!When you first approach the hotel, it looks closed down. (And write obviously, it should be!!) You enter through a side entrance with hand written signs. The""office"" is a room right inside the doors. The hallway looks a wreck! (Oh yeah...they're under construction!!) Dirt, filth, and stains everywhere. Electrical wires exposed, smoke detectors hanging down. You look at all this and wonder how in the world are they passing codes (Or are they! Hmmmm)Like I said...the room was better..although not without faults. The lights over the bathroom sink did not work, and the shower did not work well. The tv was definitely a 1980's model. Wireless internet What a joke!! When we reported the bathroom issues, they said they would move us to another room. Since we were only staying 2 nights, we thought we would stay and just have maintenance look at it in the morning. We were informed maintenance would not be in tomorrow!! (Our ever)We told the lady working the ""front desk"" that this hotel was pretty scary. Her reply was, "" yeah, we get that a lot!""

"Ah, yes, what has yet to be said about this Clarion in Greentree, which is commonly known as the hotel of perpetual construction Check the reviews folks (I sure wish I had) and you'll see that this place has been under construction for at least four years!My family, and I'm sure countless others, initially had trouble even finding the place and had to humble ourselves to ask directions at the nearby Doubletree Hotel. But even with directions, we drove right past the Clarion because: 1). There are no hotel signs; 2). We were arriving at night and the building was completely dark; 3). There were no parked cars visible from the road; and 4). The entire front of the building was boarded up.When we located the correct driveway and approached the construction zone, which once represented the entrance to the hotel, we saw a tiny sign directing us to the ""Temporary Lobby"" in the back of the hotel. The makeshift lobby consisted of a hotel room with a clerk sitting at a desk. The clerk initially could not locate our reservation on her computer, but found it as soon I had dug through my luggage to find a copy of the confirmation email.We were given a room on the second floor, thus we walked past stairwells that were closed (because of endlessly drying 'wet paint') and an out-of-order (and leaking) ice machine, until we located the elevator. Well, let me tell you folks, Disney's Tower of Terror ride is less frightening than this elevator. It looked like one of those service elevators that the public never sees. The floor was covered in dead bugs and the ceiling had holes in it, leading to the conclusion that someone must have taken the globes off the ceiling lights and just dumped the dead bugs onto the floor.When we got to our room, the carpet was so covered with nasty grease stains that we wanted to keep our shoes on. We did the preliminary check of the beds and found some stained sheets, but thankfully no bugs. We also checked for the free Wi-Fi signal and found that it was completely useless (maybe that's why the desk clerk couldn't locate our reservation).Finding the complimentary breakfast in the morning was like a scavenger hunt, where you look for clues on small paper signs in the hallways. The adventure actually took me outside of the hotel and then back into another part of the building (thankfully it wasn't raining like it had been all night). I then realized that I had just entered the main construction zone and the outside route must be the only passable route to the dining area.There was yet another sign outside the dining room which said something about Complementary Breakfast and the strange phrase ""Gratuity Included."" But inside the dining room there were at least two clearly-marked 'Tip Jars.' Now, I've been at some pretty trashy hotels in my travels, but I've never seen a tip jar in the dining room. I've also never been in a hotel dining room where it looked like a bomb had gone off, but there were drop cloths, power tools and all sorts of debris everywhere.When I got in line for the grub, I learned how the attendant earned her tips: she was there to help patrons identify the food. The person in front of me inquired about the gray-looking sausage-like links and was dutifully informed that they represented turkey sausage, adding, ""Because Clarion cares about your health."" I'm not kidding (who could make something like that up). Anyway, I tried this so-called health food, because the only other hot alternative was French Toast and I did not want any syrupy food that morning. Guess what The sausage had some kind of sugary additive to make the links taste like syrup! Real healthy, right Thus, I ended up just getting a cup of coffee and returning to my room to pack up. The coffee was okay, by the way.In conclusion, I would not have stayed at the Greentree Clarion had I not made prior reservations and had not been coming back after midnight following a music festival where it rained all day. Plus, we used our loyalty points for this room, so I couldn't even request a discount.Believe me, HUD would shut this place down if it was an apartment building and the Dept. of Homeland Security would never even consider housing immigrants there. But, of course, you and I are welcome to pay upwards of a hundred bucks a night to stay there.

"This was by far the worst hotel experience I've ever had. It wasn't just that there was MASSIVE construction going on, but they did nothing to accommodate for it. They put us in a dirty floor with exposed ceilings, spackle, and sheetrock everywhere. The lights were broken and the room was filthy. The second room they out me in had an air conditioning unit that wouldn't reach the outlet, rendering it useless in the middle of the summer, had no toilet paper and water all over the bathroom floor. The CHILDREN working the front desk, which was located in a hotel room, gave the worst customer service, greeted me with an attitude, and couldn't manage to pull themselves away from their own conversation long enough to even check me in in a timely manner. The worst. Do not stay here.

"Wish I could give this place negative stars. Where to begin It begins with no signs saying where the hotel is at. And then it goes into their ""temporary lobby"" which is a room turned into an office. The whole place is under construction which wouldn't be so bad, but my gosh they have crap EVERYWHERE!!! That leads us to the elevator. Norman bates would even say it's too creepy for him. It's marked with two different hotel names on top of that, holiday inn and ramada. Then the room. Not the worst of the worst, the decor is nice, the bed is as hard as a rock and the shower isn't even properly installed. Really wish I would have looked at yelp before booking here. Buyer beware. Oh yea! AND I knew they were under construction before we booked in June, and we were promised that the construction would be done before hand. Extremely disappointed.

"I was at the Visulite Saturday night and it was a terrible experience. I bought tickets online 2 days prior to the show. It was listed as a headliner and that the doors opened at 8pm with 2 opening acts. We got there right on time and were denied entrance. Jam Base had listed it as one show and when I bought tickets on the Visulite website it was for 1 show. We were aggressively all told that we would have to pay for the first person on stage or we would have to come back later. What Then we were told, ""it was made very clear on the website"" at which point the guy whipped out his clip board and showed us some piece of paper and was like, ""don't make me pull up the website."" If it was made so clear... why were we having this discussion To say the least, the guy takingselling tickets was a jerk and the door guy was a total bully. He not only told said, ""are you talking about MY ticket guy in there you better watch yourself or you won't be coming back!"" Really First of all, I'm a hard working polite female that does not deserve to be bullied around by some oaf that thinks HIS job is that important to keep squirrely little girls like me out of there. What am i going to do kick him in the shins tell him he's a meanie there are better ways to handle a situation. Second, I was not talking back to this guy or arguing. I was trying to figure out why on earth I would have to buy separate tickets for 1 nights worth of music at the same venue. We ended up going to Crown Station (which is an awesome spot with very nice people) and headed back in time for the show. Again, the door guy was a bully saying, ""looks like you came back for a 2nd try, huh you better watch yourself this time."" To say the least, I asked the bartender to speak to a manager and apparently there was not one there on this particular evening. I have to say, the bartender was extremely nice and apologized about 3 times over. This used to be my FAVORITE venue in Charlotte to see music, but after this terrible experience, I will not be returning. I remain very upset about this situation and can't imagine the band would be very happy knowing their fans are being bullied and talked down to at the front door. As for the sound... once we finally made it in, it was extremely loud and impossible to hear any words that the guys were actually singing. Super bummed about the whole evening... but would also be very willing to talk to a manager...

"I hated this place.  It might have just been a bad time, but, I doubt I'll ever go back.I arrived and found a seat outside, so as to smoke.  I go in and get a PBR, it's loud, there's a DJ, I'm happy to be outside.  I got pestered by a waitress a few times while sitting outside, but I can't really complain about that, since she was kind and was trying to help us out.  I had two beers and was ready to leave, when I went to the bathroom.  On my way there I got punched in the face, accidentally, by some chick that was dancing.When I woke up the next morning, I got a call from my bank about a $25 charge at Cowboy Monkey to my account.  I checked the receipt in my pocket, and sure enough: it was a $5 bill.  Turns out they take a $25 ""hold"" out on your card when you open a tab, to make sure the card is good.  The catch, though, is you don't get your money back for a few days.  I'm still out $20 to them, three days later.  I paid $25 for two bottles of PBR at this point.So, to sum it up I got punched in the face by an enthusiastic dancer and got WAY overcharged.  So, I'm not too pleased with the place.

"We left after the bar tender insulted my friend. I can see having a bad night, but do not take it out on your customers. To top off our bad experience, this place steals your money. We asked for our check after dealing with the offensive bar tender, and wrote NO TIP on the tip line. Later my cleared bank statement says the jerk gave himself a $5 tip! That is not ok!

"AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THEY SERVE SALMONELLA!!!Our dining experience at this restaurant was the worst I can remember!  We sat for over :15 minutes with no waiter and only after we went to the hostess did the waiter show up.I ordered what the waiter claimed was their ""signature"" dish, Paella Latorre.  It was served with ice cold mussels and the entire dish was less than warm.  I called over the waiter and explained.  :15 minutes later he returned with the dish and claimed the chef had ""re-heated"" it.  While the plate was hot the food was still tepid.  I called the waiter over again and told him.  He argued that he ""saw"" the chef reheat the food.  By this time, my business associate had almost completed his meal so I ate as much as I could and left about 13.We told the waiter that we expected the restaurant to do something about the check.  He returned with the credit card receipt and said there was nothing he could do.  We called the manager to the table and he refused to see our point and said there was nothing he WOULD do.The following week I contacted Blerim Meta, the General Manager of this restaurant as well as ""Aquavina"".  He has also refused to do anything and also refused to apologize for the terrible experience.AVOID THIS RESTAURANT!!  AVOID AQUAVINA!!

"I was so excited to try the pupusas after reading the reviews, but all the hype didn't reflect my experience.....located in a bright blue building, it was very unassuming....we entered through the back into a dimly lit, but very clean dining area.  The menu sounded good and had photos of everything to make it easy to choose.  my daughter and We ordered the Plato Tipico to get an idea of what they had to offer.   The tamale smelled and tasted of funky fish (I think it was actually pork and potato) with under cooked masa, there were beef empanadas, deep fried hard things that I think were potato and the bean and cheese pupusas...everything tasted of the oil it was cooked in and was very bland.  The cabbage slaw accompaniment was of no help in adding flavor.  I also had the horchata which was very good.  We tried ordering a dessert, however after taking our order, the server came back several minutes later to tell us they were out so we ordered something else only to be told later they were out of that too.  Finally we ordered the pork, bean and cheese pupusas to give one more try...it was very cheesey but bland with an odd meat taste.  Overall a very disappointing experience.

"I have been to this restaurant three times for lunch while at work, and I must say that the first time I was there, the service was slow and the food mediocre.  The last two times I went there, it was not by my choice but by group consensus.  The food is also mediocre at best, having a friend whose mother is from El Salvador, this food was terrible, absolutely terrible in comparison.  The beans and cheese and pork inside my pupusa had the consistency of water, and the hot sauce seemed like it was 3 parts water, 1 part hot sauce.  Each time I went there I called ahead and placed my order, and I had to wait at least 15 minutes for my drink and at a minimum of 30 - 45 min. to wait for my food (after ordering ahead!!).  I brought this up with the family that owns the restaurant, and they told me, in their exact words, it's not their problem, and if I had brought more people then we would have had better service and they don't need to worry about one customer because they have been there for so long if they lose one customer, they have many more waiting.  I don't understand how a place with one or two waitresses can even expect to adequately service their customers correctly.  I have been overcharged and never received items that I have ordered that were still on my check and I had to argue with the owner.  It is by far the worst service I have ever received in this city.  About 5 people I work with have all sworn to never return to this store.

"I'm a big fan of family owned restaurants, especially ethnic, so you can only imagine my excitement when I found a Peruvian restaurant here in the desert.  Sad to say, this is one restaurant I will not be returning to.The food was bland and lacked flavor.  It almost like they ran out of ""ALL SPICES"" right before we ordered (yes including salt and pepper).  To start of we ordered an appetizer, the Papa a la Huancaina, sliced boiled potato served at room temperature covered with a cold, bland, bright boldish yellowish colored hollandaisemayonnaise sauce. Let's just say it was a start to a bad meal.For the main course we ordered the Lomo Saltado, generous chunks of beef sauted with onions, tomatoes, and potatoes which sad-to-say was probably the best dish we had.  The dish was uninspiring, something you could find at a sit-down chain restaurant.   Nothing about the dish screamed Central American flavors.We also had the Jalea, a combination of breaded octopus, shrimp, and chunks of fish fillet topped with a Peruvian Salsa (a.k.a. your standard chunky and fresh pico de gallo, (tomatoes, onions, cilantro, and lime juice)). I have never in my life had something that was breaded and deep-fried so soggy in my life!!!  The breading was heavy and disgusting.  It also came with the worst plantains I've ever had.  Dry, overcooked, and extremely chewy.  Put it this way, I've had better plantains at Bahama Breeze then this place (yes I said Bahama Breeze).I am not trying to pick on this place.  I swear!!!  But when the owner's brother helps you order and tells you what they are known for and what they make best and they miss horribly  Well, needless to say I can only imagine what there non-staple dishes taste like.Not to beat up on these nice folks too much.  They place was cute.  The place was painted in a vibrant yellowishbrownish mustard type color, which gave the place a warm and bright feel.  On one wall was a mural of what was to resemble a village in Peru.  The other wall was a collection of trinkets from the native land and of course the flag of Peru.  The servers were extremely nice.  Beware, when you order water, they bring out bottled (and charge you), so if you want tap you need to ask and depending on your Spanish or their lack of English, that may be a challenge. I hate to say this because the place was quaint and the help was friendly, but if you have a craving for Central American andor Peruvian food, don't waste your money or time here. I'm just going to wait till the next time I'm back east in NY or DCNorthern VA to get real and tasty Peruvian food and I would suggest you do the same.

"Came here with our family and there are only 5 of us. Ordered pupusas and fried plantain. It took a while before the food came out. This place is a hole in a wall but we were willing to try it out because of the good reviews here. We got our food...plantain was good. The shrimp pupusas was my fave amongst beef and pork. It was alright...had better.  We got the bill and noticed that they already included the gratuity. Coming from Vegas, I have no problem paying gratuity but for it to be included on the bill for 5 people  That's unheard of. So I came up to the cashier to inquire about it, one of the girl from the cashier pulled out the menu and said, ""that's our rule...six people or more we have to include gratuity"". So I stood there a little confused until I came back to our table and my sis reminded me that there are only 5 of us. So I went back and asked the cashier that there were only 5 of us so she shouldn't include the gratuity. Then all of a sudden both girls that were in the cashier counter said that the rule was changed to 4 people. Mind you...this is within 2-3 minutes time frame, their rules changed from 6 people to 4 people. When I asked why they did not mention earlier that it was changed from 6 to 5...she kept on saying ""call the manager"" and was saying this rudely.

"Though a bit longer of a drive than we normally make for lunch, our office lunch crew wanted something different, so we decided to try and find a Cuban place and came across this one which got us all excited.When we arrived, we were unimpressed by the exterior, but figured plenty of dives have awesome food.We were seated fairly quickly in some beautiful...lawn chairs!  The chairs were the cheap plastic chairs you use when you havee guests in your backyard and don't give a crap about their comfort.  The atmosphere was tacky and unimpressive.I ordered a chicken sandwich special as I didn't see any torta one the menu (what respectable Cuban place doesn't have a simple torta on their menu!).  The sandwhich was dry and flavorless and tasted as if it received no seasoning at all.  My companions all looked at their food after tasting it and were disappointed as well.Receiving a refill on a water was like asking the government to stop spending money, it just wasn't going to happen.Horrible experience, bland food, overpriced.  In short, never going back and don't recommend it to anyone.

"Voucher 2518-6167I am seeking a refund for my voucher to Havana Cafe. Last night I went to Havana Cafe. When we entered the restaurant the hostess approached us and asked us if we had a reservation. We told her we did not and she said that they were booked up but we could eat in the bar. There were at least 6 tables open. It wasn't our first choice, but we said okay. We sat in the bar and the waitress took our drink order. After about 20 minutes the bar tender asked if our orders had been taken. We said no and he asked if he could get an appetizer started for us. We ordered our appetizers and waited for the waitress to come take our dinner order. While we waited, some other people came in and we heard them say that a 10-15 minute wait for a table was not too long. We asked them if they had a reservation and they said no, they just came in. A couple at the table next to us said they too had been told they couldn't eat in the dining room. While my friend went tell the waitress that we wanted a table, a waiter came to the table with 2 appetizers. He tried to give me the wrong one and I told him that the other one was ours. He walked away with both appetizers. I and someone at the table next mine tried to call him back but he kept going. The waitress finally came to take our orders. The appetizer waiter again came by with our appetizer and walked past our table twice. The waitress had to stop him and tell him to give it to us. We were finally moved to a table and waited for our food. When the food finally came, they brought all of the food at the same time, instead of bringing my friends salad before the entree. Also, my salad was nothing like what was listed on the menu and had ingredients that I am allergic to. I told the waiter that this was not the entree salad that I ordered and that I was allergic to some of the ingredients. At this point we asked to speak with the manager. After 10 minutes of watching the manager come in and out of the dining room, going around to talk to people at other tables we asked for the manager again. Our entrees were brought out to us. They brought the exact same salad to me and my friend's entree had clearly been sitting under a heat lamp. The waiter said that he would get the menu so he could show me that it was the right salad. The manager still hadn't come to us so my friend went to him. From across  the room, I could see from his body language that the manager was not in any way responsive to our issues. When my friend returned to the table, she told me that he was rude to her, until she mentioned that she knew the owner. The manager then came to our table. When we brought up the fact that my salad was nothing like anything on the menu and the fact that when we told the waiter that I was allergic to some of the unlisted ingredients, he apologized and said that sometimes the chef changes the ingredients and the menu isn't changed. I explained that this could be life threatening for some people.  He offered to have the salad remade, but at this point I was not confident in their care for allergy issues and declined. After 2 hours in the restaurant, we left without eating. The manager did end up giving us gift certificates for a return visit - it is highly unlikely that I will return.

"This place has turned me off of Cuban food. Terrible decor, old, hot, not enough air conditioning I guess and the Paella..please. Over cooked, smooshy, cold vegetables, almost all rice with no saffron favor ands terrible seafood...can't even get the crab out of crab legs because they are so soft and cold. Terrible. I hope this place goes out of business because at these prices...I wouldn't normally say that but...shame on you for serving this. These other reviews are from the staff, no doubt about it. Try it and then thank me,later for warning you.

"Lunch hour..only 2 tables with clients and I still had to wait 4-5 minutes to get somebody to come out and offer me a table.  $17 lunch plus $3 tip for a waitress with no personality. Carne ensebolllada was less than ok. Will not be coming back. Maybe an off day, but honestly fast food started to sound better. Specially for a $20 lunch.

"I signed up with Yelp just to write this review. My wife and I moved to AZ recently and we were happy to find a place which sold Cuban and Puerto Rican food. All the dishes we ordered were disgusting!  The fried meat (carne frita) that she ate was dry and flavorless. The mofongo she had was unlike any other we have ever tried. She asked me to try and I just couldn't swallow it. We both love mofongo so that was very disappointing. It doesn't end there my dish was the Puerto Rican plate so I was excited and thought it would bring back some memories of my hometown but it only brought back nightmares. The rice with pigeon peas (arroz con gandules) had way too much tomato sauce... I can go on forever but would rather not. I will just jump to the desert. We thought maybe since the meal was so horrible maybe they could redeem themselves with an awesome flan. When we ordered the flan the waitress said they did not have the large portion but she  could give us the two smaller portions. We said OK but to our surprise the flan was so pale and the taste was so bland. I looked at it carefully and noticed that it had the recycling symbol on it. Who does that!!!  Come on really!  I'm done with this place. I would never eat at this restaurant even if they paid me. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone unless I hated them.

"I made a special trip to go to the Havana Cafe to buy food for my mother who was just put into hospice care. Imagine my surprise when I arrived at 3:30pm and was told that I could not order off the lunch menu because the kitchen was switching to dinner service. I pointed out that the front door has a sign stating lunch is served until 4pm. The hostess got the manager who refused to allow me to order off the lunch menu. I suggested they change their lunch hour to end at 3:30 instead of 4pm so this wouldn't happen to anyone else. As far as the food, I am Hispanic, and my food makes this food taste like fast food. I only went there for convenience. What a huge disappointment!

"I will not be going back because the owner would not honor my $15 groupon.  My waitress asked her 2 times and she said no.  There are plenty of great places in North Scottsdale...this is not one of them.

"It is very unfortunate that there is only ONE Colombian restaurant in Las Vegas, and this one is not a good example of our gastronomy.  What I really dislike about this place is the inconsistency.  One day food might be good but the next it will be terrible; customer service is very bad, and sometimes they dare to serve OLD OLD food.I do love their empanadas.....they are pretty good!Las Vegas needs a GOOD Colombian restaurant and not this mediocre place.

"The food here is always good but unless your Hispanic count on getting terrible service.  I am regular customer because the food and the owner are absolutely amazing. However the waitress today was rude and condescending.  I felt rushed as she was taking my order, she was weeded with 3 tables including us and she had a runner.  30 minutes to get appetizer that were pre made empanadas that I had previously asked for 3 times and she kept saying they were coming.  Next time I will order my food to go ad avoid the rude, condescending and dismissive service.  Food is 5 stars but service was  terrible, I hate to write bad reviews especially for an establishment I love so much but she has to learn to be more hospitable.  Restaurants survive on returning customers and service can make a lasting impression.

"I keep telling myself to give this poor place another chance but unfortunately I went again on December 2013 and the service was horrible and the food as usual not good at all.. Whenever there is any Latinos in town or Colombians I highly DO NOT recommend this place at all since I do not want to make any enemies..If you are craving Colombian food go to Los Angeles there is quite a few places there that are authentic and deeeelicious! the decor is horrendous I feel like I'm in a cave someplace

"I'm a Colombian living in LA and LV. Wanted to some traditional Colombian food only to be turned away by bad service and little attention. There's only two waitresses for the whole restaurant and one cook. Both to busy to even notice my family and I sitting and waiting. When we called one of them over they rudely told is that it'd be 45 minutes before we could be helped. Left and never coming back. Sad that this is the only Colombian restaurant in town.

"Everytime I go here it seems the portions get smaller and more expensive. The staff is poorly trained and the food always comes out cold. Too bad there isn't any other colombian restaurants in Las Vegas. I went there today hoping it would get better,  but it just gets worse. I wouldn't recommended anyone going here

"* To be fair, I didn't actually stay to sample the food. I can only think of a handful of times I have actually walked out of a restaurant in which I intended to eat at. Unfortunately, this was one of them. This is why:My fiance and I bought a deal over a year ago on restaurants.com to try out this place. We were actually really excited to give Columbian food a try, but for whatever reason, hadn't gotten around to using our coupon. We finally decided to just make a plan, and go for it. We looked over the menu and were really looking forward to coming here. We were expecting a little hole in the wall, with simple but tasty food. And maybe that is what we would have gotten on a different day. Unfortunately, the day we went, two major red flags were present. 1. When we walked in, a handful of people were sitting in the ""front"" room, which is basically a convenience store front with a few tables. We weren't offered a seat in this room. Rather the hostess walked us to the larger back room- where the lights were turned off. She told us they were off because they were trying to cool the restaurant down- there is no air conditioning in the building. We arrived at 6:00 pm on a Wednesday. It didn't seem as though they were expecting customers. 2. The second we walked in, my fiance and I both instantly noticed that the entire building wreaked of sewage. The smell could not be ignored. Sorry, but if the place I'm going to eat at smells like waste, I don't have confidence in your sanitary practices. I've never been in a restaurant that smelled, and we immediately left. The health department might want to drop in for an inspection.

"Apparently Yelp hides reviews written in Spanish or sends them to the bottom.  Being that this restaurant is a Latin restaurant where most clients speak Spanish, I wrote my review in Spanish but here's my review in English.THREE TIMES, I have received bad food!  I would NEVER recommend this place to anyone for Salvadorean food.I tried to give the place a chance but after three times of the same bad food, I just decided its best to let go.The chicken or fish dinner plates are horrible.  The meat itself is dry and it seems they are not fresh.  When these complaints are brought to the staffs and subsequently to the owners attention they simply are indifferent and do nothing to resolve the problem.The last time, I ordered to go and was so angry after I got home and discovered a poorly cooked and tasting fried fish. Gross. I immediately called and over the phone the owner offered to refund the money or another replacement dinner the following day as they were closing for the night. So I was without dinner that night and had to put something simple and quick at home. The next day and the following days after, nobody wanted to do good on their word of giving me a replacement dinner, even though the owner claimed he would leave a note to inform his staff in charge.  i didn't even want my money but after a few days i demanded a refund, and it was then that they offered to replaced the fish, the fish ONLY because they felt that was the only thing that was not to par.  seriouslylol i laughed at their lack of professionalism.  who buys a dinner plate just for one of the items a dinner plate is made up of all the items on it to provide you with a delicious eating experience. that means the salad, the rice as well.  so that day they only gave me a fish! LOL i felt that i was transported to El Salvador, a third world country.  Certainly thats the only place where they would think this to be good business practice.They're a joke! The food is horrible. The chicken and fish is not fresh. Even the second fish was in the same condition.  One of the waitresses even made a comment that's how they do things. She even suggested ordering pupusas as they tend to have less issues with that, some times.  Only because you are a Latin restaurant that doesn't mean you have to provide a substandard service.  There are many other Latin restaurants that do a great job.  This place needs to take notes from them.

"Horrible service. I felt like i was treated like the ugly adopted child here. First they got my order wrong and didn't do anything about it. The horchata had a nasty burnt after taste. Pupusas were mehh... Then they took foreverrrrr to bring our desert. Seriously forever, my testicles were beginning to collect dust. And to top it off one of the flan deserts was burnt. Its not over ladies and gentlemen... Then our check was wrong too. I won't ever be coming back here for sure.

"Avoid this place! I had some beef tacos and they have to be the WORST I've ever had in my life! I have never seen taco meat like this It looked like they first boiled a steak and then chopped it with a claw hammer and seasoned it only with black pepper.My wife had the steak buritto and encountered the same lousy beef. I went to this place because I was nearby and a yelper had given it 5 stars! I can't even imagine how drunk this person must have been to give it 5 stars. Did I already say Avoid this place!!

"I got a pedicure here. Not bad, they were pretty thorough. But two days later both of my big toes were infected and oozing pus where she trimmed my toenails on the sides (which was weird anyway). I hate to rate a local shop down, but man my toes hurt.

"STAY AWAY, the owners are so rude, they blatantly say they are not doing well and then try to pretend they have the best hairdressers in Pittsburgh. they make you feel so unwelcome, advertise they offer a bunch of services and then when you ask they snap at you that they only do hair.  it was so awkward and weird .  i received warnings not to get my hair done there so i was going to get a pedicure because i had a gift certificate.  she told me her employees will only take cash if they have to touch a client's feet.  I may go there just to get bangs trimmed since i do not want to completely waste the certificate, but this place gives me the creeps, sounds dirty, and has beyond bad customer service.  They definitely do NOT know how to run a business and it is obvious why they are not doing well. Sue and Kristi pass the phone back and forth because noone wants to take a call.  she reiterates that the business is doing bad and they need more clients.  i have never experienced a ruder salon, or should i say dead beat shack.

"I think it is ridiculous that they say they need more clients!  I was all ready to be a new client.  I had a 12:30 appointment with them, and when I arrived at 12:30 on the dot, the place was locked and dark and no one was there!  I waited for five minutes (in the rain), and they still didn't show.  I called and left a voicemail saying that I was still willing to wait, and I understood if there was some confusion, but could they call my cell (I gave them the number, as I had previously given my home number when I made the appointment).  I waited nearby at a coffee shop, went back after another five minutes, and it was still locked and I hadn't received a call.  And I am definitely not estimating the time, either.  I was willing to wait a bit, and I looked very closely at the time on my phone to be sure that I wasn't jumping the gun on calling and then leaving.  Finally, I went on with my day and when I got home, they had left a voicemail on my HOME PHONE, which I had specifically asked them not to call, saying, ""Oh hi.  Sorry you missed me, but I was MAYBE two minutes late at the most.  I hope you haven't left, but you should just call back to reschedule.'  Seriously  When I was waiting, another woman came to the door.  I thought she worked there, but she was just another client, also trying to get in!  When I told this story at another local business, the women there said that I was probably the fourth person who had had this same experience at this place.  I couldn't believe it.  This place is the worst, and I have never even stepped inside!

"Now I'm picky about my hair, but Mane Attractions was so bad that I walked out after about 15 minutes of watching the stylists work on other clients.I had desperately needed a haircut and walked in for a major trim and re-shaping of my layers.  First, the girl at the counter said my hair might be ""difficult"" due to the length (it was nearly long enough to sit on at the time) and that I would probably have to stand while it was cut.  Weird, but okay.  Second, no one there knew anything about donating to ""Locks of Love,"" and I feel like salons should be aware of things like that.  I needed a cut so I went for it anyway.I watched the two stylists while I waited for my turn.  One stylist told the client whose hair she was cutting that she was going to do something other than what they discussed because it ""wasn't looking right.""  Ummm, okay.  The other stylist was too busy checking her phone every three seconds to notice she was yanking on her client's hair so hard with the comb that she was giving her poor client whiplash.At that point, I just pretended like I had received an urgent text and said, ""I have to leave, so sorry ""as I bolted for the door.

"Figure I'd give Supercuts a shot since Giant Eagle sells their gift cards so it is great for fuelperks.  I don't remember her name but she is one of the ""bigger"" woman there.  I wanted to grow out my hair longer but it was looking messy.  So I asked her for a trim to get the sidesback cleaned up.  She said ok and off she goes.  5 minutes later, we were done.   Yes, just like a bad date, we were done in 5 minutes.I got home, showered, and saw the damage.  It was messy.  What's worst is every day it grows, it looked even worst.I'll just stick to my usual barber.

"I wish I could return a haircut.Unfortunately Kelly, Melissa, and Jen were not there so I settled for whoever was free at the time. Worst trim of my life:she cut off over an inch more than just the deadsplit endsshe did not cut the hair how I described initiallyshe did not change the cut to how I repeated during the cut when I noticed she was cutting it straight across instead of curving it in the back, which does NOT mix well with my curly hairafter retelling her how I wanted it cut, she compared this tragedy to deaths of familyfriends and how I should get over itthe beautiful long layers I had and wanted again are now choppy, medium layersmy left side is even choppier than the right side of my hairI fear straightening my hair to make this unevenness less evidentI regret tipping her because I understand how the service industry works because my minimum tip of 20% for all service people is undeserved for her lack of work.I want everyone to know how the only good hair stylists there are Kelly (who moved to Philly), Melissa and Jen. If they are not available, do NOT risk going.Also, the Supercuts Oakland location is horrible at waxing eyebrows unless you are lucky to get the only woman of color there.While it was a $20 cut (after the 20% tip), I know had to buy biotin to grow my hair faster so it is more expensive to me in the end. I hope this proves helpful to all perspective customers!

"Terrible! I got a haircut here once and hated it, but kept waiting for it to settle in after a few washes. It never did look right, so I just fixed it at home rather than going back to these incompetent people. I didn't even feel like the hassle of complaining was worth it, as I highly doubted that I'd get any money refunded and I certainly didn't want them to touch my hair again to try to fix it. I then figured, hey, this place sucks for haircuts but they can't mess up eyebrow waxing, right Right! But their service is so bad that I gave up on that too -- I got my eyebrows done here a few times with not much trouble, but the last time I went in, I had called ahead to put my name in and was told that I would be next on the list, and to show up in about 20 min. My house is a 20 min walk from there, perfect! I headed out, got there in 20 min, and gave the woman at the desk my name and reminded her I'd called ahead. There was one man sitting there waiting, who I had seen from across the street walking in about 1 min ahead of me. The ""stylist"" was just finishing up a haircut, so I should have been next, right, since I had put my name in before the guy who walked in Nope! She called him over and I said ""sorry, I think I was next, I called ahead and was told I'd be next in line"" and the lady said ""oh we don't do that."" WTF You told me very clearly that you do exactly that, what craziness is this So I waited, figuring that I'd already invested 20 min into this venture, so I may as well stick it out. And waited, and waited, while one ""stylist"" cut the man's hair and 2 of them chatted in the back (ironically next to the chair where they do facial waxing). They must have been ""on break,"" or maybe just terribly rude and idiotic, because I sat there waiting for another full 20 min, and when I finally spoke up again to ask when someone would be available to do my eyebrows. The 2 chatty cathies in the back looked over, very annoyed at my presence, and the woman doing the haircut said ""after I'm done here,"" and I sat there incredulous for another 2 minutes before getting up and leaving. Will never go back.

"And so....the search for a new hair salon continues. Sigh. Don't get me wrong, the cut was a good cut. The salon itself was clean and stylish. The owner, welcoming and friendly. Now what went wrong. The cut was good, but it certainly wasn't what I expected from a salon with the reputation of Izzazu. I wasn't bowled over by my stylist's professionalism either. Don't diss my previous stylist....she rocked....you don't do yourself any favors by knocking someone else.  (And come on, I was WAAAYYYY overdue for a cut since I've been driving to Cleveland for a style.)  That being said, for $55 (and saving big bucks on gas, tolls, lunch and shopping) the cut was still a deal. But, when I started to sign the charge slip, it said $65, not $55. ""But,"" I said, ""the website said it was $55 for a Master stylist."" ""Oh,"" the chick at the counter said, ""that's for Men's cuts."" Silly me. So when I got back to the office, I went online and checked. Nope, it said $55 for a Master Stylist WOMEN's haircut. Hmmmmm. So I called. The chick at the counter now said, ""Oh, our stylist's charge whatever they feel the cut SHOULD be."" What So I quoted the prices to her from the Izzazu website. She changed her tune again. ""Oh, well.....I'll refund you $10 if you give me your credit card number."" Didn't she have my slip with the card number ""Sorry, I don't give my credit card number over the phone."" ""Or I can send you a gift certificate."" ""Nope,"" I said through clenched teeth, ""I won't be coming back.""It wasn't the cut. It was the bait and switch. I'd gladly have paid it had they been up front and above-board ahead of time. As Judge Judy says, ""Don't pee on my leg and tell me it's raining."" The search goes on. Or I'll be back in Cleveland in the spring for the next cut!P. S.  One amusing side note:  I checked in at Izzazu when I arrived.  Turns out, I'm the Duchess!  The Duchess is displeased.

"Sadly, the professionalism of the front desk never got better.  Despite Emilio's assurances that changes were being made, my latest visit proved otherwise.  I called ahead and was assured that Marshall was on time...in fact, he didn't have an appointment ahead of mine and could take me as soon as I got there.  I was there a few minutes before my appointment.  I waited.  And waited.  Fifteen minutes later, I asked if Marshall knew I was waiting.  I was told by the brunette that they had been busy.  Odd, she, the blonde and two other employees had been standing there talking for a while.  She went back to notify Marshall.  When Marshall came up front to get me, the brunette admonished him that he should keep an eye out for his clients - she shouldn't have to notify him that his appointment is there.  Wow.  And the purpose of a receptionist is....what  I'm done.  I'm out.  Apparently nothing will help Izzazu's but getting rid of the front desk staff.  On a positive note, it was another great cut.  Not good enough to lure me back, though.

"Awful facial with lulu. Used a groupon and thought it may be why she was so terribly unattentive, but realized she had no idea what I was paying with. Basically I got the 'steam machine' blowing on my face for 40 min!  Would give negative stars if I could.

"I had an appointment that was made 2 months in advance and when I turned up they told me that the person I had the appointment with quit 6 weeks ago and they didn't have anyone available to take me. They made no attempt to reschedule me with someone else or call me to cancel. To make things worse, the battleax at the front desk had such an attitude. Here's a tip, when you are in the beauty salon business, staff the front desk with someone who looks like they have actually BEEN to a salon. Not with rude women that have hairdos from 20 years ago. Will never go back.

"Unbelievable experience! Literally unbelievable. I waited 50 minutes and finally walked out. Receptionists were beyond awful. I booked 3 style appointments in advance for a wedding. One person was taken right away, 20 minutes later the second person was taken.  I WAITED 50 MINUTES while being ignored by the receptionists.  I can celled because the others were almost done and we would be running late. My stylist finally came out and said he'd quickly do my hair. What !! I'm not paying $100 to get rushed service. We were looking forward to a relaxing, fun experience. More unbelievable, I waited 20 minutes to pay for the two services. One receptionist couldn't take transactions and another was occupied with a wedding party.  I was so close to walking out and not paying. Unfortunately the two stylists didn't get a tip through no fault of their own. I can't give an unbiased opinion of their work as I am still furious in the way I was treated.  I would expect some ambiance at $100 for shampoo & style. I could never recommend Izzazu. Denham & Company is on Market Square, their rates are reasonable and within walking distance of the Fairmont.

I am not a young hip person and felt very out of place there. It is like you are walking into someone's house and bothering them.

"The coffee isn't good and they don't seem to care. If you're a local, I get that it's the only game in town but this place isn't worth traveling for. I really wanted to like tazza d'oro. I've been several times, hoping that my bad experiences were isolated incidences. I drink espresso. I know what it should taste like and what it looks like when the person making it gives a damn. I have no complaints about paying $3.00 for an espresso but if it isn't right and I let you know you should probably try again. The last time I went in, both baristas admitted they hadn't triedpulled the espresso I ordered. The gentlemen working there, who was very nice, pulled my shot. I tried it and it was very sour. I let the girl standing directly in front of me know that I didn't think it was pulling correctly and her response was an unenthused look and the comment ""ya well we just got it"". Silly me to have expected that you also want the espresso you ""just got"" to taste good...This place clearly isn't going anywhere in the near future. It's a favorite with locals who like to hangout there. It's just a shame that they seem to have all of the equipment and even the beans to make at least a decent shot and they don't seem to care about actually pulling it off.

"Maybe I am just the most jaded vegan in town; Quiet Storm's food menu bores me to tears, that which I will use to salt my own mediocre cooking at home! Their coffee isn't all that great either, as given the choice, local La Prima is in my favor. Tears. This is the only vegetarian restaurant on the East side of town, and oh so close to me, but I cannot stand to go there. Desperate times now call for toast and tea served by the sad server that resides within my depressed little dining room.

"I must be a glutton for punishment, because I keep finding myself hungrily returning to the Quiet Storm. The menu has slightly changed, and they are no longer cash only... This time it was the ""8th Ward"" that inflicted extreme disappointment. Not sure what 8th Ward is supposed to mean, but I will forever associate it with a dry boring place. And I thought we were getting a party platter! This appetizer sampler included THE WORST hummus evaar; I am near positive that they forgot to add garlic, lemon, salt and tahini to this chickpea paste that which was described as ""garlicky"" on the menu. Sooo wrong. ""The Butter,"" another WTF of a name, was also very dry and bland. The salsa was good! And there were plenty of dipping accessories, too many really, given the smallness of the unappetizing dip portions.At this point, I've tried most of the vegan options QS has to offer and the only luck I've had has been with the B.Y.O.B. Go figure. I wouldn't care so much about how much of a tease this place is if I didn't REALLY desire a comfortable neighborhood place to eat comfortable food with a comfortable view of a cute waitress who writes fiction. And it frustrates me that few others seem to recognize the culinary (I shutter at even calling it that) mediocrity of ""the best"" vegetarian restaurant Pittsburgh has to offer.

"I'm a vegetarian and have lived behind the restaurant for over 3 years. Every time I have ever gone, the service is awful. It's as if they're doing you a favor by waiting on you. I think their breakfasts are pretty good and their lentil loaf is good but usually your sides consist of yellow nacho chips with brown jalopeno slaw. Also, the cooks look like they are lacking hygeine. the one great thing about this place is their coffee, and that's it.

"Ugh... I got a plate with seisage, tofu scramble, and sundried tomato toast. My whole plate was entirely dry, chewy, and unpalatable. I had high hopes for the tofu scramble, especially after seeing positive reviews about it. But honestly... It tasted like nothing. I thought it'd be moister with a creamy consistency that might come from silken tofu, but it was hard, dry, and chewy. Hubby got a country burrito that was much better in comparison to my plate... But that might have been due to the fact that his whole plate was doused in gravy. Anything will taste better drenched in gravy. We think the gravy tastes like the powdered packet kind where you just add water. On top of all this service wasn't the greatest. I had to fish around for my own ketchup and they didn't even bother to ask me what kind of toast (3 options on the menu)I wanted when I ordered the toast option for my meal. Then they didn't bother to ask hubby if he wanted anything to drink after he had picked one of the $12 entrees that come with coffee or juice. We had to tell someone else to get it for us. Also they don't really wash their cups. There are 2 sink basins at the front where they just dunk the cups in one soapy basin then dunk the cups in a second water basin and then stack them next to the sink. It made me not want to drink my water even though I was thirsty. Good idea, but poorly executed food. I've had good vegan and vegetarian food before that's consisted of a lot of fresh greens, avocados, and more. For a vegetarian place, there was nothing green on our plates. This experience sadly fell enormously short of our expectations... Could've eaten at kaya or meat and potatoes for the same price.

"Worst tofu scramble ever. Days old, cold, hard, inedible.  Sent it back and had no time to wait for another dish.

"I imagine that this is the restaurant that I would make if I were 20 years old and knew nothing about restaurants except dining in them and what looks and sounds cool.  In that it does some things right, but none of the important things.  It has a decent sized shop with large windows and its bright, so that's good.  They have good music, but unfortunately we were seated right below one of what looked like two speakers in the place.  Its a large restaurant so in order to make it the right volume for people far away from the speaker it has to be too loud for the people close to the speaker.  I know the trade-offs of sound systems all too well.  If only there was a way to solve this problem like... just riffing here... more speakers at a lower volumeThey had a greatest hits of the thrift store type of decor and the standard shitty artists selling their paintings like at every coffee house you've ever been to.  They include coffeeteajuicewhatever in the price of the brunch because, like everyone, I hate choices too and I definitely wanted at least one of those.  I'm looking at the menu and its a veganveggie place so we're never going to be good friends but I'd like to think that there's something that looks halfway decent but it all looks awful.  There are two Tex-Mex-Ranchero breakfast dishes... that's at least one too many; and there's only like eight choices which sounds like plenty as a number but I assure you it was not enough here.I go with the Egg Frittata as my least bad option and it ends up tasting mostly flavorless but with a distinct stale note.  It comes with a salad that is not bad, but who wants a salad for breakfast.  As we're leaving the waiter, who's been fine the whole time, asks us where we're from and my girlfriend answers ""D.C.""  The waiter replies, ""Oh, I'm sorry about that.""  Now, neither of us is actually born in the D.C. area, nor do I even particularly like living there.  So I'm not personally offended, but I'm not sure if someone from or living in Pittsburgh has solid footing to talk the business about Washington D.C. or almost any other large city.  Its not like property values in Pittsburgh are indicating that everyone's clammoring to live there, whereas in Washington D.C., they are.I was not enjoying the restaurant before that, but this kid actually threw me to straight up hating it.  If you're vegan and have literally no other options... then I guess you're going here.  If both of those conditions aren't true, then go anywhere else.

"It's cheap, I'll say that, but otherwise it's bland food served by workers who mostly don't seem to notice they're working, and when they do, only respond snarkily. There are many better vegetarian and vegan options to choose from.

"Coffee and atmosphere are great... but my God, the cupcakes are the worst EVER!!!  There is a bakery right beside them; they should really consider selling the bakery's sweets or none at all.  I think a fakedisplay cupcake would have been fresher... and maybe even taste better.  Yes, it was that bad!  Mr. Manager... try your stuff before you sell it!

"I bought a latte.....no wait! Actually, I bought coffee and espresso and two lattes and something to munch on (not all for me I had a friend with me). When I ordered the 2nd latte I sat down and realized I didn't have any foam so went back to the counter to ask for some and and she wanted to charge me! Really! Maybe it sound petty to you but I like my lattes fixed a certain way and foam is the best part! It's all about customer service and considering I had just spent over $25.00 a little foam wasn't much to ask. Good coffee. Bad customer service.

"Inattentive staff.  Dirty tables, I agree with the other reviews here.  I think the ""Manager"" only hires other smokers, and they spend 90% of their time sitting outside smoking, instead of being prepared to serve customers.  I go there because sometimes it's convenient, bc of the location, but last week they left their AC broken for over a week (in 80+ degree weather).  No additional fans, nothing.Then when it was fixed, I went in, ordered coffee and an order of hummuscarrotcelery (prepackaged).  Not only was the hummus watery from sitting in that container for several days, but the celery was rotting at the ends, yes brown and rotting.  I showed the kid working there, who was probably jonesing to have his next cigarette, and I asked for another one.  Without opening it I could see at least 2-3 of the other servings of hummus were also all watery and had celery that was starting to rot, just like the one I was given.  I asked for my money back.  You know what was the worst thing, though  The kid (he knows nothing about customer service let alone food service) put the containers with the watery, rotting celery back in the case, to serve to other unsuspecting customers!  Hello, Allegheny County Health Department....Then the ultimate insult: 2 kids came in selling candy bars.  I've seen this there before, but this time, I said to them: ""You know, this is a business, you shouldn't be here.""  Well, the older of the 2 girls (probably 11-12 at most - where is her mother) put her hands on her hips and said in a smart-ass tone: ""We asked da owner, we is allowed ta be here.""Well, that coffee I spent $2 on  That is the last money I will spend in that place.  Disgusting.

"My guess is that ""Ruth K."" was put up to writing a nice review by the staff or owner.  Regent Square deserves a better coffee shop, run by someone with good business sense.  What kind of a ""business"" only prepares food (chickentuna salad, hummus) once a week  Does chicken salad hold a week in your fridge  Also, whenever they lose an employee, they just shuffle their schedule and close at 6 pm for a few months.  They should be open till 10 pm as it is, with all the foot traffic in the neighborhood, especially in the summer. My guess is they see this place as nothing more than a loss leader for the bar they own next door.   Otherwise you would think that since opening in 1995 they could at least take the time to slap a coat of fresh paint on the place!BTW, Katerbean did go smoke free before the Allegheny County ordinance went into effect, but the place to this day reeks of stale smoke.Added note: looks like my previous review was somehow deleted.  I'll just say I received an order of hummus that was watery and had rotting celery in it.  Tried to get another and 3 or 4 of the orders in the case were all in the same condition. I asked for a refund, and afterwards watched the kid working there put the other containers back in the cooler to sell to other customers. That was the last straw.  I won't spend another dollar there.

"I really want this place to be awesome, because, yet again, I want Regent Square to be an up and coming area.  This place has been here for years, and as I sit drinking my bitter, bitter coffee, and smelling the overwhelming scent of (I believe) dog pee, I wonder how it's even possible.  The three times I've been here, I'm greeted as if I'm a colonial space marine trying to fish a child out of a vent.  They always sit in the corner peeking over the top of the counter as if I am terrifying to them, then duck out of the way.  Then grudgingly come when I peek around the counter at them.  If I didn't, I'm convinced that they would just sit there, as if they're not certain of what position they hold in this place, or what the next step should even be.  This is what I like to call, ""The Dance of Shitty Customer Service.""  Today (and I write this longingly looking over at Square Cafe) I decided to give it a chance because it never is crowded, and I figured the quiet would be a good thing.  The girl at the counter was on the phone, and that's the way it stayed for two minutes until I said 'excuse me'.  The charming reply: ""Yeah"" She grudgingly got off the phone, and after accomplishing the Herculean task of handing me a cup, I pumped this swill that I'm currently drinking.She's currently muttering under her breath back in her corner.  I'm not sure if maybe she's having a bad day, or she's just an asshole, but...if I had to bet, I'm going with asshole.This place has pretty expensive coffee for how awful it is, and the food...Just don't eat the food.  (side note: this place isn't quiet at all when somebody orders something.  She stomps around like she's being sent to her room.  Then continues muttering)Okay, so this place is a travesty.  Bad coffee, bad odor, bad lighting, unbelievably bad, grudging service.  I would beg the owners to put any effort into this place.  As it is now, it's cornered the market in Regent Square, and sits like a middle finger boastfully pointing at the people of Braddock Avenue.

"Ughhhh, Katerbean is the abusive boyfriend that I keep coming back to and hate myself for it. There is nothing else around and convenience wins today due to the snow, and my extreme exhaustion and need for caffiene.Why, do you ask I just asked the gal behind the counter, kindly, if I could borrow a pen for a moment.

"Worst effin Starbucks on the block and their baristas suck at making drinks. Horrible customer service and they ALWAYS screw up our orders. I just don't understand why they're so lazy. I understand their comprehension level is low because of the lack of education though. But, if you hate your job, don't take it out on the loyal customers!

"Came here for a ""quick"" breakfast on our way from the hotel to Fallingwater, and regretted the decision immensely.Extremely long lines, and poorly trained staff. As a former employee, I know about staff roles and approximately how long it should take to receive your drink. This staff was not trained at all, and it was clear that they were overwhelmed with the crowd. It took me 32 minutes for me to receive my order (there were 7 customers in front of me), and my order was incorrect. I ordered a small coffee, medium latte, a croissant and a sausage breakfast sandwich. I know that the sausage sandwiches heat up for about 40 seconds in oven, so I can't comprehend why it took so long to get my order. Would never come here again. I also received a WARM cheese danish instead of my croissant. First, the warm, creamy colored goo in the middle is extremely unappetizing, and second, they looked so dejected when I pointed out that I ordered a croissant I almost just left.Do not recommend.

"Out of 200 reviews, I've written only 14 1 star reviews.  that's .07%.  That means I never really write 1 star reviews.  La Prima Espresso in the Strip District gets one.  :(They've got a good coffee but I will never be back, bc the older woman who is the barista in the morning was unforgivably rude, without reason.The coffee is good, I would have liked to become a regular, but I dont want to start every morning dealing with her nasty attitude.  Yesterday she rolled her eyes at me when I asked for lots of room for cream.I am a former barista.  I *know* asking for room for cream is not one of the more difficult special requests she gets!  If you hate the public, you shouldn't work with them.This morning takes the cake, and I just won't be back.  Here's what happened:  I walked in, and she was talking to a gentleman who was obviously a regular.  Because she was busy and bc I've barista'd myself, I waited patiently.And waited and waited.  It was a few minutes, but an eternity when you really need coffee!She never even looked at me.  Then all of a sudden she goes, ""Okay lady are you going to stand there or do you want coffee""  WTF.  I liked her sense of urgency, but seriously  Rude.I asked for a medium coffee in a large cup, or if that's not possible, a medium coffee with lots of room. Not hearing me, she goes, ""What was that"" and the older gentleman said, ""She wants a medium sized coffee in a large cup.""  And the woman turns to me and snaps, ""And you couldn't repeat that yourself""Even the guy she was talking to, her regular, was like, ""Whoa.""  He tried to make some excuse for her, like, ""She's just fired up today!""  Then the woman slams my coffee down on the counter.  Was she having a bad day  Am I the doppleganger of someone she hates  I dont know, I don't care.  I believe she may be the owner because surely she should have been fired by now, as there are other posts with complaints about her. ""Do not go here during the week if you expect them to open on time. I was there today and it was 615am and there was no employees at all. Managed very poorly. The older lady with a short hair cut is the one who doesn't open on time when she is scheduled. Please move this lady to a different time. 6am is too early for her."" I won't ever be back.  If that's just her spunky personality, well, her personality sucks.  Seriously lady, you're not a morning person.  You should ask for later shifts.

"I used to live in the area and would always patronize and recommend this business.  However with the last experience I will have to rethink that. My aunt and uncle ordered a gift basket for my grandmother for her birthday. When it was delivered it looked beautiful.  However once opened not so much.  Inside it was filled with....Dollar General brand goods. When I stopped down to tell them the owner and another worker told me what do you expect. If it was a busy season we would have gotten stuff from the strip. So moral of the tale. If you want to pay a whole lot of money for stuff from the Dollar Store you know where to go. To make it even more special the owner will provide a blank stare and a warm welcoming attitude that clearly shows she does not care.

"As Lindsay's best friend and maid of honor, I went with her to Jim Ludwig's a few weeks before her wedding to go over the final order for the flowers.  We sat down and Jim pulled out a list of what they had discussed.  I very clearly remember her confirming dahlias and peonies for the centerpieces.  Not only do I know that she wanted these flowers from the moment of her engagement, but I was also at the consultation to witness the discussion.  The centerpieces were definitely not what she had requested - no peonies OR dahilias and they looked like flowers picked from the side of the road on the way to the wedding.  In no way did the flowers manage to ruin her beautiful day, but they were absolutely not what she requested or confirmed.  I don't understand how there was a ""miscommunication"" as I saw the paperwork.  I just know that I won't be using Jim Ludwig's for any of my own special occassions.

"I wanted a late night snack but also wanted boba so this place had what I wanted. It was my FIRST TIME (in cap locks for the owner to understand) and I was a bit excited. As soon as I walked in. There was no greeting. (Customer service is a must for me!!!) So It was a bit awkward. I didn't know where exactly to order. Because the cashier was on the side but the menu was in the middle. And I didn't see the cashier until later because a few people were blocking it. (It didn't seem like there was a line forming because everyone was just standing around.) In the meantime I was pretending to look at the menu but I already knew what I was going to order because I looked into this place before coming. Anyways, I ordered a large taro slush with boba. Eight pieces of lobster balls, and popcorn chicken.My boba was already done and made. I thought they were going to call it out or put it out immediately (like ALL the other boba and coffee places) but no. They put it on the side until my whole order was finished. I waited a couple minutes, more than five minutes actually! Eventually I asked for it and it already melted. I didn't ask for a milk tea. I asked for a slush!!! The ""company policy"", obviously needs changing. The boba pearls are just the usual boba pearls. And the taro is the usual taro. The flavor is there. But not enough to be like OMG... It was OKAY.As for the eight lobster balls and the popcorn chicken. It was way to salty for me. It would've been great to be informed that you had an option for salt or no salt but then again... IT WAS MY FIRST TIME. So how would I even know it would be salty for my taste buds. But I do admit that the crunch lasted a while. I didn't think these snacks will get me full but the large drink filled me up so I couldn't eat the rest of the popcorn chicken and lobster balls. It was OKAY.Overall, my whole experience... It was OKAY! This place is something to check out once. I'd probably come back again but after I felt like I've been insulted by the owner and the employees looking miserable. No way!

"They kick you out at 9pm sharp! When I got here at 8:45pm, they said they were out of boba. I don't know how a place with ""boba"" in their name doesn't have their namesake product. So I said alright and ordered some popcorn chicken. It took them nearly 10 minutes to make it. Keep in mind, I was the only customer and there were two employees working. So I start eating and less than 5 minutes later, they both tell me that they're closing so I have to leave. I ask if I can finish eating (I have about 6 pieces left at this point) and they say no because they have to go out back to throw away trash and they can't leave me alone in the front. What! The popcorn chicken itself was fine, but the service was horrendous.

"Customer service sucks!Came here with my family on a Monday around 8pm. There were 2 girls working. We ordered a thai tea slush and a strawberry banana smoothie. We paid for our drinks, tipped the girls, and waited while our drinks were being made. When one of the girls brought our drinks out, we noticed they had made us a regular iced thai tea rather than a thai tea slush. We told her that there was a mistake - and she just had this look of pure annoyance. She didn't apologize for the mistake or even said anything to us after we told her there was a mistake. All she did was go to the register to ring us up the price difference - a whopping 11 cents! Seriously You're going to make us pay an 11 cent price difference on a mistake YOU made AND after we tipped your rude ass already Whatever - we paid the 11 cents and waited for her to remake our drink. After she was done making our drink, she just put it on the counter without saying anything to us and walked away. We grabbed our drinks and got the hell out of there. Seriously, I wouldn't have minded paying the price difference if the girl was nice about it. At least apologize for the miscommunication or something.Needless to say, we won't be back.

"Tried this place out for the first time yesterday since the hubby was craving boba, and it was the closest one on our way home. I got the honey lemon tea, while he got the strawberry tea. My drink okay, not overly sweet, and had a hint of a rosy aftertaste, probably from the tea. His tea, however, sucked pretty badly. First they got his order wrong and gave him a strawberry milk tea. It would have been okay had his drink tasted good, but it tasted terrible. Despite him not wanting to, I forced him to take it back since it was their mistake anyway. They finally gave him his strawberry tea, but to his disappointment, it tasted like faucet water with an over abundance of sweetener. It was so bad that he threw his drink away after only a couple of sips. Maybe it's just us since we are used to the quality of tea we get at QQ boba in henderson, but this place really isn't worth coming back to.

"Worst service ever! So the boyfriend and I were at Town Square on a Friday afternoon. We were really really thirsty, I suggested we go to Lollicup to get some kind of flavored iced tea. There was no one in line as my boyfriend and I were making our way to the order window. However, another couple got there right before us.. so we got in line behind them. There were 3 girls working, so we didn't think it would be that long of a wait with only 2 people before us and no one around waiting for their drinks. This was definitely not the case. The couple before us apparently knew one of the girls that was working there and proceeded to have a personal conversation for several minutes without even ordering anything. We ended up just leaving for the clear disregard the workers had for their customers.NEVER again will I try to order a drink from here. I'll just wait until I go to Florida to get my Lollicup fix.

Before I ordered, I asked the cashier if the avocado smoothie is made from powder or real avocado, and she said it's made from real avocado. Oh boy did she lie. I couldn't taste any avocado in the drink at all and it was sooooooo sweet, it was just like drinking liquid Splenda sugar. Taro milk tea, yuck yuck, way way too (artificial sweetener) sweet with absolutely no taro flavor at all.

"Went to Cocomero today after lunch just like I usually would for the past year when school was in session. I went up to the counter to order my usual - fruit bingsu with syrup rather than milk, because I can't have milk. What was different was the ""manager"" this time refused to make it for me. He claimed that it was best with condensed milk and I would just have to deal with it. I tried to explain to him nicely that I understand, but that's not how I like it. Also that I've been doing it for the past year and even though the amount of syrup has been hit or miss, I still like it that way, and I haven't complained about it. Instead of listening to the customer, he insists that he is ""the manager of all of this (with hand motions)"" and refused to sell me what I requested. I ended up giving up and leaving. Most likely won't be back as long as ""the manager of all of that"" is still around since he refuses to sell me the one thing I can eat and enjoying having.

"The fact that a self serve yogurt bar doesn't allow you to sample any of the 16 flavors they have blows my mind. Being from out of town and having plenty of similar establishments near my home that are same concept and allow samples I was confused. When I asked the counter ""you would rather have me not buy anything than sample 2 flavors""  Response=yes. Unreal, plenty of places are successful and lucrative with allowing a taste test. My only thought is the ownermanager must be cheaper than subsidized corn.  Fellow friends said their yogurt was bland, probably why they stopped allowing samples.

"How do I start! Yelpers beware! The high reviews offered to this place are deceitful! This place is terrible.Food: this is only reviews off the bubble tea because of previous reviews claiming it was great. Far from great it was! This watered down, tasteless, and sorry excuse for bubble tea puts all other bubble teas on top. Worst of all the bubbles tasted old and as if they were stored away all winter. Not fresh! In fact, our bubbles were more like giant balls stuck together. The tea was watery and lacked true flavor of mango or macha. What a dissappointment, however the people of the burgh wouldn't notice the difference. So fortunately for you, this is a good thing. Service: meh, slow and it seemed that they had no order in serving people.Interior: it's outside, which was nice. 1 star given. Disclaimer: I drink lots of bubble tea, if you want a true experience go to Philly or Miami. They make a thicker juice with fresher bubbles.

Fifteen minutes later the guy hands me my smoothie. I took a sip. This was followed by a frown. Another sip was necessary to make sure I was not just imagining things. Yep. This was the worst smoothie I had ever tasted. And I have had a lot of bubble teas in my day. Forget the fresh fruit. It was too watered down to be identified as a mango smoothie.

"So... My boyfriend and I found this place as one of the few (if not only) donut spots in Phoenix that's open 247. After he had a craving for donuts at 1AM, it had good reviews, and I saw on yelp that they served boba there, we decided to give it a go. When we got there, he first ordered a boba for me and began his dozen donuts order. The donuts he wanted (namely chocolate... Simple to make you would think) was not available at 1AM. He then asked for another type of donut (Boston cream)... Not available. Only ones they said they had at that time of night was glazed, raspberry filled, and lemon filled. He declined the donuts altogether because he was frustreated with continually getting ""sorry, we don't have that"".I gave this place a one star on his behalf and because I had my boba drink and it was descent, however, nowhere near the best I've tasted. I like my boba squishy and not too rough to chew. I tried boba at this one Viet restaraunt that was better but that's another yelp review in the making.Overall, case and point: we may have been better off going there earlier in the day and their selection seems to be EXTREMELY limited after typical business hours. If your business is said to be open 24 hours AND you're one of the only open available donut shops in the area that never close, PLEASE have a majority of your donut selection available around the clock. Thank you for reading this rant.

HOWEVER, someone there is engaged in credit card fraud and identity theft. My information was ripped off and sold to a third party harvester that tried to drain all the funds in my account all within the time it took to drive thru and order breakfast. But, fortunately for me I check my activity daily. I can't say I won't ever go back again, because these are the acts of an individual one would assume. But I would highly advise anyone who goes there to be a cash paying customer from now on. I know I will be.

"Service not so good lately.  One really nice girl there.  But the rest are pretty unkind.   They mess up on orders a lot too.  I ordered a tuna croissant and got home and it was a turkey yucky sandwich of which I threw away.  I called back to tell them and the girl was rude.  And I got no apology.  Terrible customer service THAT is.

"When I first found out about this place I was very interested. Within the first week I went at least 8 times bringing friends with me to show them how awesome this place is. But recently the staff here is disappointing. Yesterday I took my friend there for a  fun drink to have. When we entered we were the only customers in the place and were not greeted. He ordered a drink, and I ordered something new. We were shouted at when our drinks were ready. We sat down, and my drink wasn't the tastiest I have had. Having only one sip, I returned to the register and explained that this wasn't agreeing with me and if I could switch it out. With THREE people standing behind the counter, not ONE could speak up or look me in the eye. One mumbled that they couldn't do anything because their manager wasn't there. I asked what could be done and he said ""well, you can buy another drink."" Seriously What happend to making the customer happy I was VERY dissappointed and it will be awhile before I come back. What a pity.

"THT has to be the worst ice cream shop that I have been to. I walked in expecting a varied of ice creams, and come to see that they do not have much to choose from. I ask for the basic flavor strawberry and they did not carry it. The person over the counter seemed confused and did not know what he was doing. I did not even bother to order a smoothie seeing how bad the place looked.

"I've been reading yelp for two years now and it's been our guide on picking restaurants and what have you. I trusted the review 90% of the time wc is pretty good. My personal experience with this establishment yesterday was unpleasant. Walked in yesterday late afternoon to try this place and there's a family on one table enjoying their ice cream and two Chinese female in their early twenties who wear a hoochie mama type of clothing ahead of me ordering.  The Chinese dude in his 50's taking orders is somewhat extra nice to these 2, which is fine, suggesting to sample all the diff type of ice cream. When female one ordered, he asked female 2 about what she wants and she said she didn't want any. The Chinese counter guy said "" oh u should've tasted more free samples while u were waiting""..., my point is when it was our turn, my daughter tried one flavor of ice cream and when she wants to try another flavor, the guy had this annoyed look and said "" I can let her try another flavor but I need to scoop the ice cream & drop it to to her ""USED PLASTIC SPOON"".... What a rude ass!  He said its a waste to give my daughter a new spoon! That's the 1st reasons why they scored one.2nd - while he's about to do my Boba, the family who's about to leave decided to order some soda, the bastard stop and took their freaking order. Not sure if I have the look of a PUSH OVER, but I know my face doesn't look friendly anymore.Last, the register broke. The dude was now clueless on what to do so the family who were paying for the soda helped him to figure out what they owe.After 20 minutes of hell and mistreatment, he can probably tell I'm about to explode and let him have it.... He gave me a scoop of ice cream to top my Boba for the inconvenience and I can tell from his face, he don't really wants to do this.To be honest, the wait doesn't bother me but the fact that this perv was ALL nice and giddy to these young hoochie female and he wants us to re use our freaking plastic spoon the it's reason of the 1 star. Their Boba by the way is just 2 stars. I'd rather go to Cefiore down the road or better yet, Fresh cup in chinatown. Btw.... The red bean Boba is so bad..we drove straight to Human Bean and got Snowy Mocha instead. I know it's not Boba but were almost home so I got coffee instead.

"This is only for boba.My friend told me this place has really good ice cream but I was craving for boba tea, so I bought taro tea with boba. When I first took a sip, the taro flavor was vague and didnt have enough taro flavor in a taro tea and the bobas were very hard and not fresh. LIke come on! I wanted taro not like a watery purple drink.  I took few sips and threw it away because it was disgusting. They seriously need improvement on their flavor or the powder they use. If you are going here for Taro, try somewhere else, if you are going here for boba, don't waste your money!

"I absolutely hate to do this because I would totally give this place a five star rateing. However, today was possibly one of the worst experiences ever...Usually love this place. The owner is always nice and we like coming here to visit this one worker cuz she's always nice but today we were helped by two girls who have pretty cruddy customer service. My boyfriend got a vegan brownie sundae and asked for no fudge. The girl still put fudge on it, which was whatever. Then we asked to have the brownie warmed up since she failed to ask if we wanted it warmed up before hand. They took the ice cream off and just handed it to us in a cup (I honestly would have replaced every thing) They proceeded to warm the brownie and burnt it. Then 10 minutes later still no warm brownie. She said the brownie was soft but still chilly and asked if it was okay....I mean I guess we've been waiting a while so nevermind already..the icecream was half melted any way. So in result no warm brownie and melted icecream. They were sorry but didn't do much to fix the problem.

"Immediate tummy ache!!! I should've stayed away after reading the reviews but it was close and it was late at night so I gave in. In short, one freezer wasn't working so all tubs were stacked on top of each other in working freezer. Took too long to sample flavors because she had to move tubs around. Husband was not impressed so just told me to chose what I wanted n get out of there. I chose on a Sunday, pictured with chocolate syrup, walnuts, banana, and two scoops of ice cream advertised at $5.50. Chose green tea and taro...ask for no chocolate syrup. Came to check out and she charged me a $0.25 fee. When I asked her what that was for she said for the banana. After pointing out the price and picture, her answer was ""That's from a long time ago"" !!!!  I told her my piece of mind, mentioned I was a yelp de-customer and went outside to eat. Halfway through my Sunday my stomach is turning... We're pulling into our driveway now and I am running straight to the toilet. Avoid this place, as a fellow business owner, know that I've discounted many clients because they had seen other pricing (be it old). It's all about customer retention. FAIL!

"Walked in to the sound of a blender in the back kitchen with no greeting. 6 minutes later a girl comes out with two drinks for the people waiting before us. I finally get to order a honeydew slush. She disappears to the back to make it, which is strange because there's a full blender set up in the front. After hearing the blender go off about 6 different times and another 5-6 minutes she reappears with my drink. Mind you she's only making one drink, so I don't know why the blender went off so many times. It's super icy, very light on the honeydew flavor and the liquid is separating from the ice mush. Definitely not coming back. What a waste of 4.50. Go to tea planet or volcano tea on spring mountain. Their boba is delicious, flavorful, smooth, and quick!

"They get the single star not for the doughnuts but because it was 112 degrees outside and they had no AC going in the restaurant. It may have been hotter in the restaurant than outside it. It was hard to order since I couldn't concentrate on anything but the heat. I bought three doughnuts but couldn't ditsy to enjoy them because of the warmth. I bought the chocolate Bismarck, a raspberry jelly, and some sort of crunch doughnut. They were all good. Too bad I had to enjoy them in the car of the Starbucks parking lot. I will try them again hopefully in January when I won't care if it's so hit inside the restaurant.

"First time here and we received terrible customer service.  I usually don't write many reviews but as a marketing major I was in shock.  We stood at the counter for several minutes waiting to see about getting a bowling lane and then were cut in front of by a group a people who were eagerly greeted, the guy announcing orders over the intercom sounded absolutely irritated and like he hated life and then when we were finally helped at the counter we were told we could bowl if we could get done in 50 minutes or less.  The whole experience was extremely unpleasant and we will never return and I will never recommend.

"Warning to parents:  the wave pool is not safe for children under the age of eight. My five year old is a strong swimmer (Gold Medal Swim School in Chandler for 3 years) and almost drowned due to a current created by the waves. The lifeguard posted right above her made no move to rescue her until I told him she was drowning. She was crying for help but he didn't hear her.   I thought this would be a gentle pool as it was for a child's birthday party.  If I would have known the strength of the waves I would had my swimsuit on and my daughter in a life vest. I hope the lifeguard finds a different summer job- he almost lost a little girl literally under his nose.

"Remarkably unprofessional!  From the moment you walk in, at least one of the receptionists is pleasant, another is a complete loud mouth, and the things that come out of her mouth are absolutely rude and ridiculous.Thanks to ""loud mouth"", I've learned (in detail) that the Director of Nursing at this facility is having an affair with one of the male staff members.  Can you imagine waiting to greet your loved one and learning about such shenanigans  All from your seat in reception!This, combined with very poor bed-side mannerisms, and the fact that I've met this DON (and she is HORRIBLY unfriendly) told me that the facility is not fit to care for my mother, and we pulled her out after just a few months!Please do your loved ones a favor, do not send them to this sham!

"My father was a resident in this nursing home for almost two years.  The care he received was inconsistent and disappointing, to say the least.  I found that some staff members were professional and caring, but the majority of the CNAs who interact with the patients on a daily basis were unprofessional and severely lacking in bedside manners. I strongly recommend exploring other facilities if you are in need of care for yourself or a loved one.  There are places out there with caring, competent staff members that far exceed TLC in quality.  This place has so-so reviews on medicare.gov.  They may be able to check basic boxes, but when it comes to personalized attention and compassion, they have a long way to go.

"Very unprofessional and sketchy staff - all the other yelp reviews will confirm this.You know a nursing home is bad when you call to get information on your family member who is receiving care and the rudeilliterate nurse you get a hold of refuses to identify themselves - won't even give you their first name.  What kind of nursing home hires people like thatLater we found out my family member ended up hospitalized due to dehydration.  They refused to assist my family get information about his care after he was ""discharged"" - that was the word they kept throwing around even to my family member while he was still there waiting for an ambulance.If you are considering placing a family member in this facility, read these reviews and also this news story: http:www.8newsnow.comstory23140454nursing

"Don't know wherehow to start this review - I will start with, if you can find ANY other place to send your family members for care, it would be in your best interest to do so.  My moms insurance company gave her no choice to go here.  Repeatedly I arrive to visit her and she is in a wet diaper and has been for a very long time due to the smell. I lost my cool and a nice person (wish I could remember her name, great smile, not a nurse, someone with authority) told me should would find someone to help.  She stopped a man in the hall and he gave her instructions to find a nurse.  Later I found out this man was the ADMINISTRATOR and he passed my need for help onto someone else.  In a nutshell, don't bother making a complaint the director of nursing will NOT return phone calls. Her name is Donna and the nurse who told me her name told me not to tell anyone that she told me her name as she would be fired. I could go on but it makes me more angry to think about it. Positves, clean facility, allows healthy pets to visit, decent food. Cons, unhappy nurses, poor care, no one who can help will listen at the management level.

"I am giving this place zero stars.  My grandmother was sent to this hell hole, to build and regain strength. After being at TLC for almost 10 days,  my grandma had been vomiting large amount of green vomit for days, Her blood pressure was finally checked and it was so low, they rushed her to Er. My grandma is now laying in ICU, with the worst Pneumonia one can have. All of this is caused by lack of staff members doing what they are paid to do. ( Care for the patients) When my grandma arrived at the ER, photos were taken of her bed sores, and amounts of green vomit. My grandma was severely dehydrated, mal nourished , and know where near where  the recovery she should have been.According to several staff members at the hospital my grandma is currently at, say that TLC is well known for all of their neglect. I will go to my grave fighting to have TLC's doors closed and pray that all staff members get what they deserve when they need care someday.I am aware that when we get older, we will pass. There is no reason to take years away from anyone, due to laziness. This place has messed with the wrong family this time.

"After being admitted to this facility my elderly friend received a few days treatment and then was constantly badgered to sign into a hospice facility called Solari. She was told by TLC that she could stay there up to 100 days. Then suddenly, after less than 2 weeks she was told she had to leave...period, no notice. Once again the Solari rep showed up only this time she stated that she could only stay 2 days in Solari. Moved her the following day.

"If I could give this place Zero stars I would.  They hire personnel with NO health care experience to run the Expressions (Memory Care) Unit.  My mother was a resident there (she had Alzheimersdementia) until she passed away.  I didn't write a review prior as I feared that the care she received would be even worse.  Imagine visiting your Mother and finding her with fooddirt caked on her hands so thick that you had to scrub her hands before you could hold her hand to help her stand up.  Or how about taking her to get her hair done and her scalp had the worse case of ""cradle cap"" that the stylist had ever seen.  Her dr even advised the personnel at Prestige that they needed to do a better job washing her hair, use special shampoo and watch her while showering to make sure she washed the shampoo out if her hair.  The worst experience was when my mother fell and they sent her in an ambulance to the hospital with no paperwork or personnel fromPrestige with her.  She didn't even know who she was at this point!!!  By the time I got to the hospital the people there are trying to ask her questions and don't know why she can't answer them.  To cap off this awful experience when my mother's death was imminent I sent an email with explicit instructions as to what they were to do when she passed.  I was assured ""your directives will be followed"".   Needless to say THEY WERE NOT!!!!!!!  I called to check on my mother at 8:30 in the morning to see how she was doing that day and was told what they did for her the night prior.  When I questioned them again I was told ""Oh she died at 3:00 this morning didn't anyone call you""  When I got ahold of the facility director all I got from her was""I guess we messed up.""  Real compassion there.  Maybe they spend all there time making the place look nice and playing games but they sure missed the boat when it came to taking care of my mother.  If you are going to have to put a loved one here you might want to think again.  For $4,500 per month you think you would be able to get better care.  If we could have taken care of my mother in our own home I would have.  If we had unlimited resources I would have moved her to another place.

"My mother recently received rehabilitation services from Freedom Plaza. The people that work at Freedom Plaza are very friendly. Beyond that there is very little positive I can say about her experience there. In the 2 weeks of her, supposed, rehabilitation she never walked more than 150 feet. She had been labeled a liability. This is interesting, considering the entire reason she was sent there was to walk and rehabilitate after open heart surgery. She walked more in the hospital ICU than she did at Freedom Plaza.  During her two weeks there she was not showered or bathed one time.  She was continually pulled up out of her recliner by her arms, which is contraindicated after open heart surgery. We met with case management to address our concerns, but none of them were addressed. Case management rarely returned phone calls. I would not send my mom back to Freedom Plaza given the choice. I would not recommend that anyone send their loved one there for rehabilitation. They may do a good job at long term care but they do not do a good job at rehabilitation.

"Ehhhh...not so much.While the building, level of service, and rooms were in line with a typical Holiday Inn, the staff and management committed an egregious offense against me - a returning and Priority Club customer.Brief summary of my horror story - We check in, we get the wrong room.  They move us, give us keys to a filthy room.  We bring that up and leave for the day for them to clean it.We get back to the room, and I check my bank account and find a significant amount of money missing - $329.  After spending about an hour on the phone with my bank, we trace the charges to the Holiday Inn I am staying at via the card that I have left for incidentals.Despite prepaying for the room, we've now given the Holiday Inn about $600 for a two-night stay in a $110  night room.Furthermore, the banks had closed so I couldn't transfer more money into my checking account until after the weekend.  It wasn't that I didn't have access to cash, but I had financial fraud to deal with on what was supposed to be a fun weekend with the guys.When I bring it up at the front desk, I am immediately given run around.  They pull up my info on their computer, and gasp as they see their error.  The staff wouldn't take ownership of their mistake, they simply blamed a computer error.  I finally get a manger who says he'll deal with the issue, and I don't receive any further communication, as I'm pretty sure he wasn't planning on working during the weekend.The next day of my stay I call the front desk again, and demand answers.  This manager was a bit more assertive in handling the issue.  She spent time on the phone with my bank, and then my bank conferenced me in as we searched for a way to overcome Holiday Inn's costly error.After dealing with this issue for about 5 total hours, it becomes apparent that there is no way my money will be returned until after the weekend.  I demand to only pay half of my hotel bill, which is immediately granted.  By then I was tired of dealing with the issue and took their bill reduction as adequate compensation.Ultimately, don't use a debit card to pay for incidentals on a hotel room, because hotel systems may automatically withdraw an egregious amount of funds from your account, which could cash screw you for the weekend.  Also, DON'T STAY AT HOLIDAY INNS because the staff and management is comprised of lazy, lying, and incompetent thieves.That is all.

"This is the second time that my husband and I have stayed at this hotel.  Both experiences have been terrible.  The staff is very rude and does not go out of their way to smile or go the extra mile.  The decor is bright and nice, but it is not maintained very well.  The lobby could use a good cleaning.  Also, there is a $15day charge for parking at this hotel.  The location is great, you can walk to pretty much anywhere, but it is very noisy even on higher floors.  We were mostly disappointed because we got a double room for Valentine's day and when we asked to for a king room, J.J. told us that we had booked online so we got whatever they had.  We felt like we were treated as second rate citizens because we had booked online.  Then when we got to the room, the faucet was so loose it fell over.  It was fixed promptly, but made a bad first impression.  Neither time my husband and I have stayed at this hotel have we had a good experience.  I would strongly recommend staying at one of Charlotte's other nice hotels if you want a good experience.

It's actually quite sad because I'd like to share the information, but I'd rather lick dog poop off the bottom of my shoe than waste another moment of my life on this place.  It's awful and we won't be going back.  The worst of our experience  Let's just say that the hotel employee who used his master access to open up our room, while we were in it, with the privacy sign on, pretty much sealed the deal here.  If anyone's had theft problems, this may be why.  Hotel staff was quick to throw out ""sorry"" for each thing that went wrong, but we strongly suspect nobody meant what they said.

"I recently went to a wedding reception here. I felt sorry for the bride and groom. The place was not clean for starters. The food was the worst part. The salad was soggy from the dressing sitting on it for far too long and then they put on top a hot fresh baked bread stick that came from the freezer, which in turn made the salad hot. I had the sirloin, it was cold, chewy, and bland. My date had the vegetarian pasta, it was over done spinach pasta with some sort of flavorless cream sauce and veggies. Mix in overpriced drinks and you have one of the worst wedding reception venues ever. Stay away!

"My husband, a friend, and myself went there for fish on black Friday. We were surprised that it was not very busy so we thought we would get service pretty quickly. We sat at a table near the salad bar and waited....and waited... and waited. We saw one server and also saw another table waiting for service as well. The waitress never once acknowledged that we were sitting there and she had to pass our table to to wait on another table. All the waitress had to do was say she would be right with us...or SOMETHING. After waiting a half hour with no word from the waitress, we got up and left. Murphy's Bar was way more accommodating.

"My boyfriend and I came tonight 1219 for fish fry, it was our first time... The service we got was the worst we both have ever experienced. It took us 30 mins to even get a menu or drink! We finally got a menu and ordered water, 5 min later a different waiter brought us water and took our order. I got salad from the salad bar it was fine, but my boyfriend got the soup which we were guessing it was clamchowder. After 15-20 min our fish arrived it took us probably 5-10 min to eat the fish we were given, we ordered all you can eat, 15 min after we finished our food a different waitress came with our bill... We were never asked if we wanted more. We told them we were not going to pay for all you can eat when we got the same amount as a regular order. After the whole experience taking over an hour and a half my boyfriend is now sick from the food, I don't think we will ever be coming back for food here again. Which is unfortunate because the fish was actually decent.

I'm giving these people 30,000 for a certificate degree, not even an associates degree, and I have no idea where my money is going.why because every day i come to class, we run out of some type of food or necessary supplies, and they are usually out of stock on all their supplies.The apartments they stick us in arent even close to what they advertise, and they stick us in a fairly bad part of town thats actually 20 minutes away from the campus.and dont get me started on the students here. if you like the fact that they accept just about anybody, and yes, that includes people with under a 2.0 GPA and people who've been out of school for 20 years, then youll do fine here. If you're like me and you dont like how the school accepts everyone just so they can pocket the cash, then dont go here.I really regret giving these people my money, but its the quickest way to get into JWU and get a little experience while i'm at it. Save your money and go to JWU, much better investment.

"My girlfriend and I where totally lied to by everyone we talked to. Finally someone from finacial aid pulled me into a side office away from the enrollment counselors and pointed out bachelor's degree would cost a minimum of 90k... I recieve the maxium amount of grants and loans, I still would have have to pay over $1000 out of pocket every month to cover tuition... Throughout the course of the meeting I consistantly asked why my finacial wouldn't cover the total cost of tuition when at other schools (that cost the same per credit hour) I would be getting a refund to help cover the cost of housing. Everytime I asked it no one would answer me... They just tried to push me to the point of signing papers and paying the application fee... I went home, got online and did my own research, the reason their tuition ends up being more per degree is because they make you take 60 more credit hours... FOR THE SAME DEGREE!!!! If i was going to 90k for an undergraduate degree I would attend an Ivy league school... F$%^ THAT SCHOOL... The best part is when the enrollment counselor could see that I wasn't going to sign or pay anything until I did my own research, she started getting super aggressive to the point if she wasn't a girl the meeting probably would have ended voilently... How can she even get mad at me If they wouldn't have lied to me in the beginning I wouldn't have been there... The situation felt like I was being screwed by a used car salesman...

The Phoenix location makes me feel like going back to Portland for that type of abuse.  Phoenix is much worse.  The teachers don't give your grades promptly, nor do they explain what they are expecting to see from you to determine the difference between a 79, 85 and 93 on a project for example.  They are supposed to submit these grades so you can check them online.  I have yet to have a teacher who actually does.  When you finally corner your teachers to get your grade, they just tell you that you are doing fine.  I was a straight a student with a previous BS degree.  I attend all my classes and turn in every assignment on time.  I am an actor pursuing a film and video degree, I have never considered myself an artist (drawer, painter, sculptor).  I do not mind having to take these classes for my degree, but I just wanted to keep my GPA high.  I have never had so many B+'s in my life.  Some folks would be OK with those grades, however, I am a serious student and pride myself on my GPA.  The teachers at this school don't seem to care about truly helping students.  It definitely seems like they just hand out grades arbitrarily and don't place much emphasis on returning your tests and assignments promptly.  Even some of my A's were just given to me because of how the teachers may have felt about me.If you are not in the culinary program, then you are definitely the redheaded step-child at this school.If you are not a video game nerd, an artsy gay looking femme, or a hot fashion design chick, then you may feel like an outcast at this school.I am a non-traditional student and a transfer student, their bullshit sales tactics and focus in not designed to reach these demographics.I am clean-cut, in my 30's, prior military veteran, former college football player, and have already worked in the profession I am pursuing a degree in.   I have yet to feel welcomed by any staff member or fellow student at this school, accept for security when they ask to see my ID.You are not allowed to pick your own classes or schedules at this school.  They ""somehow"" register your classes for you, then you have to go through much hassle to change it to a more convienient plan.If you are a transfer student, (even from another Ai in the same degree program).  Prepare to be screwed in you degree audit.It is very difficult to find personal tutoring on a project or software program.  Even though they advertise differently.The only decent thing about this school is, that they do have decent gear and equipment, and the people who work in the rental cage are very helpful.  However, you have to have permission to check out gear overnight or over the weekend.  This just seems like an extra hustle, and other schools don't have this policy.  All in all, this school really sucks.  If you are disciplined and focused you can get what you need out of this school, but you will regret the price and experience later.  If you are a virgin, nerd or loser looking to meet and mingle with your peers, and figure out what you want out of life, then this is the school and experience that you need to have.  Otherwise, if you are young and seeking the traditional college experience, or older and already have a job and other obligations, then I suggest you go to a ""real"" college or university.  ASU or U of A are some good ones.  They don't need to hire and train people to be sleazy salesmen in order to pressure you to come to their schools, they actually have prestige, and they don't need to advertise solely to losers at home sitting on the couch, watching daytime network TV, dreaming about a career in....Like the Art Institutes have to.

"Only missed a total of 2 days, didn't actually miss them. Just showed up late because of morning traffic, and that's only for one of my classes. My grades are pretty low now, and it's finals week. There saying I haven't turned in most of my work when I actually have, they still haven't even put in my grades. Plus It's now been 3 weeks since they've last been updated. I soon found out that I actually wasn't the one who was slacking, but the Teachers them-selfs were. Especially when it comes down to grading.

"If you would  like for someone be disrespectful to you especially when give helpful advice or please attend class here. The staff feels they own this non profit and disrespect you with little apologies or consideration. They do not even return emails in a dispute. They respect depth of your pocket book giving little in return. The charges high premium for class so you can learn with famous artist from another state. However complain they have no money up date an obsolete system, but flying artist from NY, Chicago and elect is ok.  You don't receive much knowledge or support except you painted with this well know artist. Does that not sound like it helping local artist or non profit. My favorite part is hiring an education director 2013 without a college education or little knowledge of the arts. For as many art education majors out there it is miss directed use of funds not supportive to arts in any way.  This school has no courtesy or  loyalty to students,  educator been there for years. You would expect that for price they ask. As a Connoisseur of 5 star establishment, gallery's  and assisting in many non-profits the school fails on all accord. But you got to paint with so in so that all you can say.

"We went on a weeknight.  Place was not busy waited over 20 minutes for drinks and to have our order taken.  We ordered an app and it came out with the meals and that was another 20 minutes or so.  Food was luke warm at best.  I would not go back.

"The food was absolutely gross! I ordered a turkey club which comes on a wheat bun with avocado, bacon, and turkey breast. What I got was TOTALLY different from the picture! First of all the sandwich was on sliced bread (lame)! There was no avocado, 1 slice of bacon, no lettuce, and to TOP it off instead of turkey breast they used freaking LUNCH MEAT! lol No, not the kind that you get from the deli, the other sweaty nasty looking stuff! Gross! Our waitress was awful but they were extremely understaffed so I would have a bit of an attitude if I had to wait 10 tables without assistance too.   The manager was really nice... Of course that disgusting sandwich that I didn't eat was free.

"Visited the Dave and Busters in Homestead, PA last night. Waitress mixed up our credit cards and gave my brothers credit card to someone else and he theirs. Charged them already too - both incorrectly My brother had to walk around and find out who it was. Waitress never apologized. GM was extremely rude and refused to give my brother his original receipt back saying they had thrown it out. DID NOTHING TO REMEDY the situation and ignored us the rest of our visit - not even a refill. After spending over $300 plus games, we will never go back. Whatever happened to the customer is always right HORRIBLE service

"To keep it short and sweet: Save yourself $100. Buy a good board game, your alcohol of choice, order a pizza, and invite your friends over. What an incredible disappointment. After seeing the enticing commercials so many times, we decided to give this place a try on a double date. I understand the prices of the play cards and won't dispute them; however, the food was incredibly over-priced, came out COLD (as in, sat on a counter without warmers for a minimum of 30 minutes) and I literally had to ask the bartender if there was any vodka in my drink. It was pure juice. $38 for three shots that had little-no alcohol in them. (Not to mention, my glass was dirty, and I saw the bartender scoop the glass into the ice basin because she was too lazy to use the sanitary scoop. I know the Food and Beverage Commission would be as disappointed as I was.) The service was terrible. Don't ask for anything from your waiter, as they are a little too busy on their cell phones or conversing amongst themselves. Was it fun to be in an adult-themed arcade Yes. If you're looking for a good atmosphere to go with friends to play games, I suppose I would advise you give it a shot. I would never recommend their food, customer service, or drinks. Save yourself the money and stay home, or go for a traditional bowling, figure skating, roller-blading, rock climbing, basically any other physically-entertaining themed date instead.

"I was here on 103 and I have to say this was a horrible experience.  Me and a friend went here to eat and play a couple games afterwards.  It took the waitress at least 10-15 minutes to greet us and by that time we knew we should just order then because we might not see her again.  We ordered and got our drinks and well let's just say we didn't see the waitress again until she was giving us our check (some manager delivered the food to the table).  No refill on my beverage, no how is your food, no ketchup for my burger or fries was offered.  Lots of people running around like crazy and if your understaffed hire more people!  I will not be back again to eat.

"Came with my BF we started with the crab artichoke dip. It was very greasy and had virtually no crab. The wedge salad was good and crisp. I had the hazelnut crusted chicken. This has to be one of the worst dishes I've ever had it was like pancake syrup over breaded chicken. To finish the meal we had the homemade chocolate chip cookies served with hot fudge. Well there was no hot fudge it was chocolate syrup the ice cream was so crystallized from melting and re-freezing all around disappointing.

"If you are looking for an ""after-school"" program for your kids where they jump around for 45 minutes, but learn nothing related to ""real"" Korean Taekwondo or for that matter Martial Arts, then this is the place to be. The fact that the word Karate is over the door of a Taekwondo facility is due to the fact that they are not sanctioned by the  KoreanTaekwondo association as their forms, techniques and testing are not approved nor recognized. Students are passed from one belt to the next regardless of how they perform during testing. Simple logic is, pass the kids, make them happy so they keep coming in and paying the monthly fee. The basic phylisophy of martial arts is nothing more then a pledge they say at the start of each class, but zero is done to ensure these words are understood or followed. Most of the kids are out of control and disrespectful to the instructors and other students. Any attempt to voice the slightest bit of constructive critism is met with anger followed by bullying emails. If you want real martial arts, go somewhere else, this place is a joke.

"Do research on karate and compare schools. This school puts emphasis on katas and teaches very little sparring. Ranks are questionable at best. If you want to do nice katas and you do not care about learning real karate or practical self defense this school may work for you. This school is also not at many locals tournaments, red flag. Took my child out and put them in another school. He's now having to relearn everything and realizing they could have gotten really hurt becouse they thought they were learning self defense. It's dangerous. But, if you want to exercise and learn Kata dancing and point sparring this could be a good fit, otherwise please do your homework.Teenagers are doing most the teaching. Or adults with new black belts.

"I wished I could give them zero stars. My daughter attended coach Ed's the high rollers class and was harassed and treated awful. This coach has a demeaning attitude and makes excuses for everything.  I noticed from the first class that the coach didn't have patience with the kids and would get frustrated if they didn't do the moves correctly even on the first try. During the second class my daughter had a blister and asked the coach if she could go to the bathroom to wash off the chalk. I could see from the viewing window that he grabbed her hand and could also see my daughter's face in pain. My daughter came running to me and he had squeezed her hand so tight that he burst her blister. My daughter is not sensitive at all and has taking gymnastics at other gyms and I know that this is not the way to threat kids. After the class I talked to the coach and all got from him was complaints about how the other coaches in the gym don't see eye to eye with him and he deviated the conversation to other stuff,. I also talked to my daughter's previous coach to explain my concerns. I was told that since he only had two-three fingers in one hand he might have burst her blister by mistake, but said that his demeanor was different from all the other coaches. During her last class she was told by the coach Ed if she was deaf multiple times and was told to go away. During my whole time dealing with this coach was pure torture for me and my daughter, he does not give kids a chance to learn the moves nor he showed that he cared about the kids or had regard for parents. After that incident my daughter walked out of the class and told me everything. I immediately talked to the front desk and she informed me that the gym knew of coach Ed and that they he has had previous problems with other parentskids. I spoke with the owner, but I got the feeling that I was ignored. I got part of my money back, but not all because she said that I only had a problem with one coach. To me it shows that she does not take responsibility for her employees and did not really showed much concern. Yes it was only one coach, but it only takes one person to do damage. My only regret is taking my daughter here, and I will not referred anyone to this hell place. Their website contradicts to what actually happens here..beware it is not a safe learning environment.

"This review is based on observing my daughter's class in the 'firecrackers' group...I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY FOR 'FIRST TIMERS' OR INEXPERIENCED TODDLERS. How class goes; there are two instructors per class. One instructor gives a quick demonstration giving them instructions what to do on the equipment at each station. The kids chose which station they want to start at and then they rotate from station to station. What I've been seeing; all the kids are at different skill levels, different heights, different ages, and some are better at following directions than others. While some of the children are able and capable of maneuvering around the equipment themselves other children who are too little or inexperienced end up waiting around until either A. The instructors finally make their way to helping a different station, B. a kid gets impatient and has to ask the instructor for help or C. The child gets bored and starts wandering around and doing whatever they please, getting in the way of the other kids. Let me be honest and say, my daughter was definitely 'C'. She is too short to reach most of the equipment on her own, she is also inexperienced in gymnastics and she has a high energy level with very little attention span. Throughout most of class she was waiting around for help, get bored and do her own thing ultimately getting in the way of everyone else. Several times neither of the instructors noticed that she walked away to another class or was off in a corner away from everyone just playing by herself. The instructors neglect in engaging with the children. All I have seen them do is spot the children on the equipment. They do not have any kind of activities for the children to do together as a class, they do nothing to make their learning experience a fun experience. I'm not trying to tell anyone how to do their jobs but perhaps it could be beneficial to divide the kids into two groups, one group per instructor and start at two different stations rotating together, keeping the kids into two groups instead of four-five. Maybe that way the kids can each possibly get more attention from the instructor and even be kept an eye on more easily. I don't know if it would work, but its a suggestion...they definitely need to rethink what they can do to better organize the class as a whole and better engage the kids, it would be appreciated for them to evaluate what they can do to maximize the services they are being paid for. I absolutely did not respect one of the instructors putting my daughter on a time out during a class. He said she was too hyper and he didn't want she or any of the kids to get hurt so he put her on a time out to calm down. I understand that he was thinking of their safety BUT I didn't believe a time out was fair because honestly if they had been paying more attention they would have noticed her standing in line waiting to be helped for almost 10mins before she decided to have free play. And each time she went to another station she would wait for so long before getting bored. Can you blame her (or any other kid) she's only 4, five minutes to them is equivalent to 30-60 minutes. I am not upset about the time out itself, I do believe in discipline, I care that she got put in time out for entertaining herself due to the lack or organization by the instructors. Truthfully the class looks like 'free play' being monitored by instructors who only help them on the equipment...after they wait and wait and wait until one of them are available. They could improve their class by adding activities and games that relate to gymnastics and can help bring the class together as a whole. Also...I can't stress this enough...the instructors really need to engage with the children rather than just ""spotting"" them on the equipment. Fortunately I used a Groupon deal before deciding to register for regular classes. She has one more class to complete and then we will be looking into other gymnastic businesses.  I am exceptionally disappointed with the experience my daughter has had with this company. Fortunately she is only 4 so she doesn't know the difference, but she will absolutely not be returning.

"My experience with Rico's Martial Arts Studio has led me to believe that Tae Kwan Do is Korean for  ""Let's see how much money we can squeeze out of our members before they quit."" Their turnover rate is very high due to all of the hidden fees associated with attending class there. From mandatory uniform changes with outrageously priced clothing($50 for kids shorts), to overpriced mandatory equipment, to advancing students 12 belt at a time so you have to pay double for each rank increase, these guys know all the tricks.I would only recommend this place if you are a recent lottery winner or if you don't mind feeling like you are getting robbed 3 times a week.Aside from that, I found the program to be satisfactory..

"Rico's Martial Arts is a total rip off. Mickey Rico will shake your hand while going straight for your wallet. They are constantly up selling everything there. Everthing you do there costs more and more money. The last straw for me was when they started giving half-belts. That way they can charge you twice as much, twice as often.  I don't know how they sleep at night. Mickey Rico would be better suited as a used car salesman.

"You know that feeling of being taken advantage of the morning after a one night stand Well I have it after going to this place.About 15 of us girls went there to celebrate a birthday. We got there early (7:50pm)  and were surprised by the $8.00 cover. We argued that it was not 8 yet but their clocks are what they go by. ..Oh well, we each paid it and then desperately tried to find a table - what a joke! We ended up at two high-top tables in the very back with a big ceiling support blocking half the stage. The drink prices are very high (Scottsdale high!), the bathrooms are disgusting and small and the piano players beg constantly for tips. Another disappointment was the 2 male piano players went on break shortly after we got there and a female singer took their place. She is good but there is something wrong about hearing a female sing Elton John and Billy Joel. Leave the girl songs to the girl and the boy songs to the boys!Anyway... 2 hours later, we were out of cash and annoyed by the high alto singing - we left and won't be back.Save yourself some money - go to a local bar and listen to Karoke!!

We went down the stairs to enter the place and our friends walked out. We promptly walked back up the stairs and asked for a refund since we didn't go in the building. The employees collecting fees said no. They were rude and uncaring. I asked for the manager and they laughed. Talk about a rip off. Never going back, never recommending this place, and never saying good things about it.

"So we got the groupon and reserved a good table. The music was awesome and the service was fast. Our entire group had a good time... Until the check came. Each of our tables paid our tabs and tipped at least 18%. Everything was cool until the waitress came back and spoke with our tables individually and solicited us for larger tips!!  She kept asking if her service wasn't good, and if it wasn't she wouldn't have gotten nearly what she got. She wouldn't go away and kept insisting we didn't tip her. I've never been solicited for tips when we obviously gave her enough.... And its not the first time I've heard this happen at the Big Bang. Its like they were taught to do that. We will never be back.

"First off the piece of garbage so called bouncer said my picture wasn't me. I retorted, Really He said yes, this isn't you, do you have a debit card or credit card with your name. I provided the proof, but like I told him my ID name is different from my real name, thanx SSA. But my picture still looked like me sans long hair. Anyway, we were told no cover charge and we were given two free drink tickets. Mr. Garbage bouncer, who will remain unnamed, said no we don't accept those. Even though it had their name and were laminated by the club.I asked why they had canvassers out on the street tonight handing these out He said to get people to come to the club.

My roommate was respectful when the bouncer asked him to get off the stage immediately and his response was to remove him from the bar. I was standing directly behind it when the ordeal happened and that was not the real story. The bouncer lied to the head bouncer and had the entire party removed. Also, the TV monitor's picture that is airing the stage has the worst quality picture I've ever seen. Might as well throw a black and white TV on the wall. What kind of establishment removes a group of 20+ people for their employees' feelings getting hurt We brought business to them and now We will NEVER be back.

"I will NEVER, EVER go back here. End of story. I went with the boyfriend right after it opened in Feb. '08. It was some special neither of us paid cover and it was $5 cosmos for ladies. The funny thing is my beer drinking BF ordered a Cosmo and received it for $5, maybe the waitress thought this funny or something, I sure did. Anyway, the music was out of sync between the two piano players, the kitchen was closed and it was only 10 or 11 PM and the guy playing the piano reminded me of a super annoying Joe Pesci with his dumb jokes. They embarrassed some drunk girl on her birthday with really vulgar stuff. I'm not a prude, in fact I'm pretty foul mouthed and minded, but if this guy said that stuff to me I probably would have knocked him right off his piano stool. We finished the only drink we ordered, payed our bill and booked it to The Yardhouse to enjoy the reverse happy hour and some beer.

"Cover Charge Was Too Expensive. Drinks were very weak.  one of the piano players, Sam Ferguson... What a detroit punk... We had to pay him three times to get one request up and I am talking at 10-15 bucks a pop.

"It's Saturday night and the bf's 30th birthday.  A group of us decided to head to The Shout House since it was fun the last time we went (Nov 2008).  This time, however, was not enjoyable.  We got there around 9pm and paid our cover.  We were lucky enough to find a table that was a good distance from the stage.   After about 20 minutes a waitress finally came over for our order.  We got a round of beer and water - the water never came and it took another 20 minutes to get the beer.  The place was not crowded so I'm not sure what the hold up was.   As we were drinking our beer we could not help but notice the table next to us: about half a dozen middle aged single women that were incredibly drunk and overweight that were grinding on each other.  Then the painist introduced an engaged couple - yet again a middle aged, overweight couple dry humping and grabbing each other on stage.  We all became disgusted and hurried to finish our drinks.  We all agreed to leave.  On our way out the birthday boy asked to speak to the manager - he complained about the waitress and then asked about a free birthday cover.  The manager said that if you let them know when you are in line then yes you can get in for free.  They do not advertise this so the birthday boy asked for a refund for his cover.  The manager would not comp him.  He stated that they do not give refunds.  This manager needs to work on his customer service skills.  It was his birthday afterall - why be a dick and lose business  I can't see myself coming back here ever.

"Here is my two  word opinion of The Shout House:  Never again!First of all, you have two guys banging on pianos at the top of their lungs.  Not for me.  Major headache after a couple hours there.  Major.However, for those with not such great hearing, it would be a fun place to spend an evening.The service is horrid and the waitresses are slow and seemingly uncaring for the most part, but nobody will care if they are having fun I think.  I definitely wasn't more and more as  the evening wore on.If you don't hear so well as I seem to, you will just love this fun, enthusiastic place.I was there at the beginning of a Friday night until maybe 9pm.  I understand it gets more raunchy as the night wore on.  THIS was my mistake going there so early.  I'd rather get a few laughs from the raunchy cause early in the evening it was waaaay too tame for me, personally, but to each their own.A gal I know with meetup.com complained it was way too vulgar at the end of the evening.  She's been coddled, obviously, and was probably mortified if anyone said, ""poop.""  So, like I said, to each their own.It was the constant loud noise that burned me out and not the bad service or the non-rauncy lyrics I heard.  This, I guess, is one of the downfalls of having better than normal hearing....crap!

"I enjoy the finer things in life.  The music of Air Supply, the films of Michael Bay, and fine dining.  So when I drunkenly stumbled across the Shout House one evening, I knew this place was right up my alley.I got into the restaurant and was told to sit wherever I please.  That's always a sign of a classy restaurant. Freedom to do as you want, America style.  I sat outside because I wanted to make sure that as many people as possible saw me eating there.  I was not disappointed.  I can't even tell you how many people walked by saying, ""you're in for the worst experience of your life.""  I knew they were just jealous.  The waitress, whose name escapes me (because of the aforementioned drunkenness), took about ten minutes to decide to come to our table.  I like it when restaurants seem to have a policy of making their patrons wait.  It just amps up the anticipation.  I ordered a Blue Moon, because I had already had eleven Jack and Cokes before breakfast and figured it was time to slow down.  I had just come from church, for chrissakes.Taste is not a thing I enjoy, so when my Blue Moon arrived watered down fifteen minutes later (more waiting! :D) I was particularly excited.  ""Mmmm this is totally worth $5,"" I thought.  ""I'm glad you like it,"" replied my striking blonde () waitress.  ""Did I say that out loud"" I said back.  I really can't stress enough how drunk I was.""You did.  You've also been ranting about Communists since you came in, and I think you peed your pants.""""You have a good eye, sir.""""I'm a woman.""We sat there in silence for four minutes.""FOOD!"" I said.  ""I want food!""This startled the waitress, and she screamed.""Feed me.""""Yes, fine.  What will it be""""Cheeseburger and fries.  Medium.""""Done deal.""Forty minutes later my burger showed up.  Some people like to compare food to heaven, others hell.  ""Mmmm this is purgatory!"" I exclaimed!  ""There's absolutely nothing notable about this food at all. And look! You forgot the cheese! I knew it would bring too much spice to my meal.""Half an hour later, my ginger () waitress returned with the check.  ""Wow! All this for only $40!"" I said.""I expect a good tip,"" my waitress, who I think had black hair, said.""Oh you'll get a good tip!,"" I replied.  As soon as she walked away, I got up and left because I suddenly remembered I had no money.I would DEFINITELY recommend The Shout House to anyone who likes watered down beer, burgers that taste like water, and waiting around.I just remembered, my waitress was a brunette.  And a man.

"I have been to piano bars all around the country, from Miami to Cali and back and this was by far and without a doubt the crapiest one!!  I genuinely like piano bars since they can be a really fun place to blow off steam while enjoying a good show; not here!!!!!!  Never a good sign that the place was pretty empty on a Saturday night the weekend of Cinco de Mayo and the Kentucy Derby, but nonetheless I and four other guests sat down.  I can easily handle the unstable tables or that all of the chairs felt like they were just about the break apart, I'm actually good with that.  I can even handle the fact that it took our waitress almost 20 minutes to just say hi as she walked by to another table.  I would even go so far to say I can handle the horrible tasting food, it's a bar right Your there for fun, not a gastronomic awakening!  What made this place the crapiest piano bar in the United States was the continuous Barry Manilow cover songs with an interspersed Elton John number- and they were horrible at both!  The drinks are VERY short pours, let me say this again since it bears repeating- THE BARTENDERS SHORT POUR YOU TO THE POINT OF BEING OFFENSIVE.  I went up to the bar (which was empty as well, I can see pattern forming here.....) and was met by a young man who was giving me the ""what the hell do you want"" stare.   I asked to have my martini look like a martini and not a  12 shot in a martini glass.  His reply was ""well that's what you get unless you pay for more"".  Holly crap, what a horrible place!  Here's the bill lowdown- 2 martini's, 2 Grey Goose mandarin and sprites- total bill-------- $72!!!  That's before tip (which they sure as hell don't deserve) or anything else since I paid for the burger with cash at delivery.  There are a ton of other great piano bars in the valley and there are some good bars in the Glendale area, just stay away from this shit hole.  I would bet $20 that this place is closed by the health department within a year, that is, unless it goes out of business for being such a disappointment.  DO NOT GO TO THE SHOUT HOUSE IN GLENDALE, AZ.  Chewing tin foil would be more fun than going back there.

"Stay away.  Far away.  Go if you want to be insulted and not valued as a customer.We went with a group on a Wed (very slow) night to listen to some music and have a nightcap.We left when we were told ""you are the oldest people here"" (we are in our 40's) and didn't care to sing along to a song before our time.The manager even apologized for the poor form of the piano players. If they were astute business people, they would have realized that their ""oldest"" customers had the most amount of disposable income to spend there.   As such, we took our money and found another place where they welcomed our business.Never again.

"In Montreal it seems to be normal to charge good money for mediocre to poisonous food. We're it not for my favourite cheap and cheerfuls (Thali, Thai Express and a few others) I would never eat out at all.This evening a friend of mine wanted to go for a bite, I was really just looking for a coffee while he ate. We ended up at the Griffintown, because it was close and looked reasonably appealing.Once seated I checked out the menu, and though I wasn't hungry I saw Pulled Pork Tacos and couldn't resist. Now -- I should know better, as there is one thing you can be sure of -- no one in Montreal actually knows how to cook, much less something as tasty as pulled pork.My pal ordered a burger, and when he specified no bacon, what do you know he got bacon -- STRIKE 1My Pulled Pork arrived, and it was cold: trichinosis anyone STRIKE 2 I sent it back, and at that moment I realized that Griffintown was another over-hyped, under serving restaurant.I didn't want anything else to eat, as god knows what goes on in that kitchen, but making food is obviously not their forte.The final strike was the out of tune, bad sounding piano, being beaten by some woman who required sheet music to play old standards, and her accompanist, a microphoned double bass.Would I go there again BZZZT The only saving grace was they comp'd our meal. Which when you think about it, thats about what it was worth -- nothing.

"Terrible brunch place. The service was terrible. Walked in no one greeted us, after 5mins of standing in the entrance waitress told us to sit anywhere. We sat down at a table and waited another 15 minutes to get menus. The waiter then told us we didn't sit at the right place and that we should of waited for someone to seat us...once we ordered the wait was reasonable although we had all finished our plates before the waiter brought us our drinks. Terrible experience, terrible service. Many much better places in the area, don't waste your money here!

"Would definitely not reccomend.   The embroidery did look great... on their 2nd attempt.  BOTH at my cost.   Ordered and paid for 2 shirts to be embroidered 1 week in advance.   Went to pick up and they were screen printed.  I then had to purchase 2 more shirts, at my own expense from target, to be done correctly.   Larry(the owner) gave me a $10 refund for something that cost me almost $70!  Bad business!!  Would not reccomend!!

"Just to clarify, my rating for this business is not based on the quality of their work, but based on their service. The problem I had with them is that I never got any service. I called them on a Thursday to see if they can do a rush order for me because I needs shirts made by Sunday. The service rep promised everything will be done by Friday and that he'd call me to let me know it's done. He called on Friday afternoon to tell me that it won't be done until Saturday and he'll come in on Saturday to finish the job. Of course, no calls on Saturday and Sunday, so I missed the deadline where I could've order from another place and actually got the shirts in time! The rep finally called me on Monday to ""confirm"" that I still want the shirts. Wow thanks Sherlock!!! I needed those shirts bleeping yesterday!!!Anyways, I don't recommend businesses that over-promise and under-deliver.

"I had the same problem as Allan H. I was not in any kind of rush for my shirts. I gave them 2 weeks to print my shirts. I got no calls on the day the shirts were suppose to be ready.

"""Second time I tried them, second time disappointed. The wait is long with no seating but more importantly work mediocre. Had them embroider military labels. Despite being specific and spelling name out it was misspelled! After the clerk argued, he realized and said he'd fix within 15 minutes. 45 minutes later I left as I had an appointment. When I returned the job was shoddy and it was clear they simply removed the transposed letters and the new ones didn't line up evenly with the existing text. Never will I return. The owner didn't even apologize.

"Do you remember the crappy apartment you rented in college or grad school  The one with the bad ac and dirty carpet  The one with the barely functioning electrical outlets and tiny, almost useless, kitchen  Well if you ever want to relive that experience, stay at Shadyside Inn Suites!I spent six years of my medical training in Pittsburgh and found myself with a few days off last month.  Why not take my wife and young son back to my old stomping grounds in Oakland and Shadyside  We've found that when traveling with a young child, staying at suite-type hotels (with at least some sort of kitchen facilities and a separate bedroom) is very useful.  The most convenient suite-type hotel to Shadyside is the Shadyside Inn Suites.  Unfortunately, since this business has a virtual monopoly on the area, it must believe it can put its clients up in deplorable, nearly unsafe conditions. These comments are based on our experience with the building on S. Negley Ave.  I believe there are at least two other buildings the hotel maintains as well as ""Mansion Suites"" which are reserved for VIP's or people staying for very long periods.General Complaints:1.  Exposed electrical and cable wiring (see pics).  We tried to spend as little time as possible in the room because I didn't want our 19 month old to inadvertently touch exposed wires.2.  Dirt.  Everywhere.  When we were getting ready to leave, I did a quick last run through the room to make sure we weren't leaving any of my sons toys behind.  I made the mistake of peeking underneath the couch.  Yuck.  Food remnants, dirt and debris from who knows how long under there.  Disgusting.3.  General poor maintenance of the building and its parking lot (see pics.)4.  The furniture in the rooms looks like it has been there for at least 15 years.  Our dining table was strikingly similar to the one I had in college.5.  No dishwashers.  Not unexpected given the age of the building.  But if you're not going to give your guests a dishwasher, at least give us sponges so we can wash our own.6.  When you check in, the hotel bills your credit card for the entire length of the stay ahead of time rather than vice versa (completely the opposite of every other hotel in this country.)  Keep this in mind if you want to leave early after seeing the condition of your room.7.  Three separate keys are required to get into the building and your room.  Again, completely out of date and not particularly secure.Also, the vaunted customer service that they crow about on their website must be limited to special guests and celebrities. 1.  When we asked for an extra blanket to be delivered to our room, we waited for over an hour with no response.  Ultimately, we had to drive back to the main office and retrieve the blanket ourselves.2.   The remote to the DVDVCR combo had no batteries in it.  I had to get the AA batteries from the main office (I didn't even bother to attempt to ask them to be delivered to our room) and had to wait while the office staff repeatedly found AAA batteries for me.  I was told the AAA batteries fit the flat screen TV remotes in the rooms.  I had to calmly explain that we did NOT have a flat screen TV in our room, rather we had a non HD CRT TV that was at least 10 years old. 3.  Daily cleaning of the room costs EXTRA.  Be sure to read the fine print.Perhaps some of its other buildings are more modern and in better condition.  Perhaps we had the worst unit in the entire complex... but I doubt it.Unless you absolutely have to be within walking distance to a business, client or family in Shadyside do yourself a favor and find a more modern, cleaner, safer and better hotel.  Shadyside Inn Suites should be ashamed of itself for the condition of its facilities.(61110) UPDATE... Shadyside Inn refunded the charges from our stay.  They report they are adding staff and upgrading their facilities.

"Update... Shadyside Inn refunded the charges from our stay.  They report they are adding staff and upgrading their facilities.In response to the manager's comments:  As I noted above, they refunded our stay.  The TV cabling is exposed... perhaps not as dangerous as exposed electrical wire, but not something to be particularly proud of if you consider yourself to be a business built on customer service and the impression of luxury. The ""ongoing"" repairs in the hallways were not touched during our (middle of the week) stay, so one must wonder about the urgency of those repairs.   The building we stayed in was not full.  Why did they put my family in the oldest, most dilapidated room As far as moving to a different room, any one who has traveled with children would know how difficult  it is to move from one hotel (or hotel room) to another.  We arrived after a 3+ hour drive at 5pm in the middle of a thunderstorm with a very tired and cranky toddler.  Given the relative level of competence at the front desk at the time of check in, we weren't confident that any room we would be moved to would be any better.I stand behind my review.  If I could give the place zero stars, I would.

"I'm granting one star because there's no way to give none.As I write this, the door to my room is open, and two burly gentlemen are drilling and hammering and drilling and hammering--I just checked, and it's going to go on all day. Evidently, the inn is installing a new lock system, and for some reason it was impossible to wait until I checked out later today. Counting on solitude and quiet, I'd brought work to do, but it's now utterly impossible to concentrate. I stayed here once before and loved it, but this lack of concern and respect sets a a new low.

"We stayed at the Shadyside Inn for months and spent thousands of dollars. I really wanted to write a good review, but the experience was disappointing. The quality of service from the staff was inconsistent. Some of them were nice and helpful while others were snarky and rude. When we provided feedback to the manager (Carol S.), she was extremely disrespectful. She was not receptive to customer feedback at all, and her response was very unprofessional, to say the least. We also experienced no water or gas on short notice (in the middle of winter) and slippery lobby floors with no warning signs (*we had one bad fall).  And the elevator did not work at times.We will not stay at this hotel again.

"Ehhhh...not so much.While the building, level of service, and rooms were in line with a typical Holiday Inn, the staff and management committed an egregious offense against me - a returning and Priority Club customer.Brief summary of my horror story - We check in, we get the wrong room.  They move us, give us keys to a filthy room.  We bring that up and leave for the day for them to clean it.We get back to the room, and I check my bank account and find a significant amount of money missing - $329.  After spending about an hour on the phone with my bank, we trace the charges to the Holiday Inn I am staying at via the card that I have left for incidentals.Despite prepaying for the room, we've now given the Holiday Inn about $600 for a two-night stay in a $110  night room.Furthermore, the banks had closed so I couldn't transfer more money into my checking account until after the weekend.  It wasn't that I didn't have access to cash, but I had financial fraud to deal with on what was supposed to be a fun weekend with the guys.When I bring it up at the front desk, I am immediately given run around.  They pull up my info on their computer, and gasp as they see their error.  The staff wouldn't take ownership of their mistake, they simply blamed a computer error.  I finally get a manger who says he'll deal with the issue, and I don't receive any further communication, as I'm pretty sure he wasn't planning on working during the weekend.The next day of my stay I call the front desk again, and demand answers.  This manager was a bit more assertive in handling the issue.  She spent time on the phone with my bank, and then my bank conferenced me in as we searched for a way to overcome Holiday Inn's costly error.After dealing with this issue for about 5 total hours, it becomes apparent that there is no way my money will be returned until after the weekend.  I demand to only pay half of my hotel bill, which is immediately granted.  By then I was tired of dealing with the issue and took their bill reduction as adequate compensation.Ultimately, don't use a debit card to pay for incidentals on a hotel room, because hotel systems may automatically withdraw an egregious amount of funds from your account, which could cash screw you for the weekend.  Also, DON'T STAY AT HOLIDAY INNS because the staff and management is comprised of lazy, lying, and incompetent thieves.That is all.

"This is the second time that my husband and I have stayed at this hotel.  Both experiences have been terrible.  The staff is very rude and does not go out of their way to smile or go the extra mile.  The decor is bright and nice, but it is not maintained very well.  The lobby could use a good cleaning.  Also, there is a $15day charge for parking at this hotel.  The location is great, you can walk to pretty much anywhere, but it is very noisy even on higher floors.  We were mostly disappointed because we got a double room for Valentine's day and when we asked to for a king room, J.J. told us that we had booked online so we got whatever they had.  We felt like we were treated as second rate citizens because we had booked online.  Then when we got to the room, the faucet was so loose it fell over.  It was fixed promptly, but made a bad first impression.  Neither time my husband and I have stayed at this hotel have we had a good experience.  I would strongly recommend staying at one of Charlotte's other nice hotels if you want a good experience.

"Quite possibly the most miserable hotel experience of my life. noisy, dirty, poorly renovated and the WORST customer service known to man.

She kept saying that I should have known but I would not have been so upset if I had known the hotel could charge my card any time they wanted!!

"We had a series of misfortunate events take place from the moment we arrived, all the way through to the time we left.  It's actually quite sad because I'd like to share the information, but I'd rather lick dog poop off the bottom of my shoe than waste another moment of my life on this place.  It's awful and we won't be going back.  The worst of our experience  Let's just say that the hotel employee who used his master access to open up our room, while we were in it, with the privacy sign on, pretty much sealed the deal here.  If anyone's had theft problems, this may be why.  Hotel staff was quick to throw out ""sorry"" for each thing that went wrong, but we strongly suspect nobody meant what they said.

He seemed annoyed with us because we just ordered fried oysters and lots of drinks(it was Friday and happy hour, so we were sitting around chatting and drinking)  we were actually going to order an entre and stay for dinner but Bo seemed very disinterested in us, until it came time to pay the bill, then he was really nice(tip time!

"This was our first visit to this restaurant. It boasts a Louisiana  style menu. However this dish ( cajun platter) lacked any type of cajun spices. You can't serve red beans and rice with no gravy  and consider that to be a  Louisiana style dish. My husband ordered the New York strip and had to put salt on it because there was no flavor. I certainly have had better and I would not visit again. Overrated!

"Visiting Charlotte from Los Angeles while husband is in town for business. The good: The upstairs dining room has a live band and lively atmosphere. People are talking loud and enjoying themselves. Have a drink before your dinner comes for an even better time. We each had a glass of wine. The sauce from the barbeque shrimp was the best part of our meal. Not the shrimp, the sauce with bread dipped in.The bad: Food is mediocre. We had the Cajun popcorn, which is fried crawfish that comes out partially covered in a remoulade sauce. Good, but on the salty side. Tell them to put the sauce on the side when you order so you can dip instead. The sauce took away from the dish and the ones that were smothered in the sauce remained on the place, uneaten. We each had a cup of seafood gumbo, There is no meat other than seafood in the gumbo (yay!) but it was bland and the rice seemed undercooked and flavorless. We ordered a large order of the barbeque shrimp and I got a side order of grits. The sauce in the barbeque shrimp was spicy and delicious; dip the bread from your bread basket in this tasty broth. The shrimp were on the small and limp side; not memorable at all as far as texture. The final insult: the grits. Grits are a favorite food of mine. I'm a southern girl and make real deal, bomb-azz grits at home. The grits at Cajun Queen were those instant, ""add boiling water to reconstitute,"" grits. Culinary blasphemy.I will not return. If you want real grits, go to Mert's Heart and Soul.

"So incredibly let down by this dining experience. Our waiter was simultaneously overbearing and absent-minded. Half of our table got their meals 10-15 mins before the other half and the waiter forgot to bring two of us our desserts. Meanwhile, the food was terrible. The fried green tomatoes lacked any kind of seasoning and the crawfish etouffee was bland and not at all spicy. The tollhouse cookie pie was also a travesty. How does one mess up a cookie pie! At least the key lime pie was good, but not worth the $250 dollar bill :(

"Do not waste your money! The gumbo tasted like the roux had burned and there was no salt whatsoever. I ordered the blackened chicken to be safe thinking ""no one can mess up blackened chicken"".....I was wrong. None of the food (including the blackened chicken) were seasoned with salt and pepper. This was the most bland, overpriced food I'd ever had in the city. I ordered my toddler the chicken strip little gators meal. The fries were the best thing out of the entire meal. The service was as also dry and not very friendly or inviting from the hostess to the waiter, Brandon. Geez, I know it's a Tuesday night (we arrived at 5:30) but at least show some enthusiasm as I arrive to spend a whopping $123 (4 entrees, 4 alcoholic bevs, 1 kids meal) on a below average meal. It would've been more had we been charged for the uneaten cup of gumbo.

"DISABLED PEOPLE, PLEASE BEWARE I've been a patron of Cajun Queen for over a decade but my experience tonight was humiliating. I treated my sister to  a birthday dinner and despite our online reservation, we were asked to leave in  the most demeaning of ways. I have a debilitating childhood disease and use a wheelchair on occasion ; tonight was one such occasion. I could only order food I knew didn't require cutting, so I opted for potatoes and a salad. My sister ordered a full meal with wine. I had two mixed drinks (so we're not cheap diners). We had to signal for another glass of wine for my sister, despite seeing the party next to us being served appropriately. I'm not sure why we were overlooked but I'm left to wonder if it's the small portion I ordered that was disparaging.Anyway, when my sister went to look upstairs a minute to reminisce, our server asked my sister quite off the cuff, ""Do you want help with 'her' (wheel)chair I kinda need that table.""Taken aback, my sister said, ""No."" We took note of the EMPTY tables on BOTH sides of us and the fact that the restaurant wasn't crazy busy as we remembered. I spent $67 on a tab for two  and left a TIP of $20--clearly more than twenty percent.I don't know many people who tip as graciously as I  do. My reasoning for leaving the tip despite the service, was it being Christmas time and it's something I do for goodwill.When we rolled to the handicap ramp, it was completely (I mean, completely) blocked off by an A-frame sign about parking; see for yourself. Had  my sister not been with me, I would have not been able to access the restaurant at all.I haven't  always been disabled and ran a restaurant, myself (loved every minute of it). I know how people can take advantage (campers) and I know people can be uber-cheap at tipping. I don't fall into  either ilk. I know good service when I see it; I know how to approach diners who overstay their 'welcome (their can NEVER be anyone who overstay their welcome; consider it flattery); it's part of doing business and keeping patrons happy.  Take a loss here and there. We were in and HOME in a little over two hours. The couple beside us with the adorable little girl who  laid all over the booth was fine by me; she's a child and CQ is a noisy place. I felt a sting of angst when I asked for my food to be wrapped. The facial gestures were quite unsettling.Please don't tell me I'm sensitive: I've had over FORTY surgeries--TWO with NO painkillers afterwards. I've walked on a BROKEN leg to buy wrapping paper tape been accosted because I wasn't 'messed up' ""enough'"" to ''deserve a handicap tag. So enough ---but there's  no excuse for inhospitably between diner and those needing  to use the facilities.''PLeASe let these be a isolated parents.'PLEASE LEAVE :)

"This place is like the equivalent of The Clubhouse, in Tempe, but in Phoenix. The layout makes no sense, and the character of the building is incredibly, old and out dated.

"Maybe I am the most ""uncool"" person on Yelp, but I HATED this place.  A friend and I decided to meet here thinking it sounded like a chill place to have a drink, relax, go down memory lane, etc.We drove separately and I arrived before him.  I paid a $10 cover to get inside, only to discover that ""inside"" was so dark I could not see, so packed I could not move, and playing the most INSANELY loud I-don't-even-know-what-to-call-it music I have ever heard.Trying not to be a diva, I went to the bar and ordered a Jack on the rocks.  It took me screaming at the bartender to accomplish this feat, likely through no fault of his own.Anyway, my buddy showed up and miraculously recognized my silhouette in the dark.  (I am a perfectly normal size 1012 so I didn't stand out at all.)  He ordered a drink and we stood in awkward, pitch-black, booming silence until we decided to just slam our drinks and leave.That was the most interesting $15+ dollar Jack (including cover) I have ever had.I don't see the appeal.

"We were scheduled to go with an events group of around 35 people. My friend and I got there 40 minutes early. A man that appeared to work for the place was propping the door open and greeted us. We milled around and listened to the band run some practices and sounds test. We talked to the bartender about food and was told she could give us some menus for pizza delivery. We waited about 40 minutes for the rest of our group. At 7 (opening time) we were approached and told we were not suppose to be in there and asked to leave. The man didn't offer to  our $5 entrance fee or walk us to a waiting area he just asked us to leave. So we did. Outside  there were people milling around but it appeared our group would make up the majority of the patrons for the evening. We did not know that what appeared to be a front entrance was not the front entrance. No one stopped us or came up to us for 40 minutes. It was not a weekend. I tried calling but no one picked up and I tried to find an email address with no luck. I doubt I will return unless they contact me and explain themselves. If my employee talked to someone in that matter I would fire them. When I told the man I will never come back he shrugged. What amounted to a misunderstanding was handled with extreme rudeness and with a complete disregard to our future business. I will be informing our event coordinator of how we were  treated as well. The group does events every night of the week. I hope he removes this one from our future schedules. All we saw was a dirty club with torn bar stools.

"Save your money, gas, and time.  Over priced and food took way too long to get to our table.  I went once before and it was ok the second time I was sad I spent dateNight here with friends.  I was embarrassed we suggested this place.  You want great chicken go to Lolos in Phoenix!  Sorry.

"Seriously If you cuss the bartender will correct your word choice and possibly kick you out Don't get me wrong, there's no need for gratuitous cursing, but it's called ""colorful language"" for a reason -- it adds affect. Besides, this is an adult establishment, right Where are the impressionable children and easily offended nuns P*ss off.As my accomplice said, ""This place is a f*cking time warp."" (Luckily out of ear-shot of the bartender.) That wasn't meant as a compliment. Rather, an observation of the tacky lounge-jazz on the juke box and inordinate amount of gaudy tiger decor filling up every square inch of wall space. Gag me.If I'm brought back here, I'll be the one kicking and screaming in defiance.*For the record, I did not get kicked out. I just didn't like the feeling of having to watch my language so closely when I'm, go figure, AT A BAR!

"This place is NOT wheelchair accessible.  There is no disabled parking, the ramp to get on the sidewalk is on the complete opposite side of the parking lot, and then as you attempt to push someone in a wheelchair to their entrance, the path is constantly blocked.  Things certainly don't improve once you finally make it in.  The whole thing is a joke.  Good music, sure, if you can get there.

"Although the crepe was very good and our waiter was a kind young lady, our seemingly great experience turned into a bitter one when a rude Monsieur told me to walk out or throw away a partial sandwich I had in my bag that I was going to finish from my breakfast earlier. I understand if you would like to point out that it might not be allowed in this establishment considering I was completely unaware of it, but if our table is still consuming from the restaurant as well, I personally would consider it twice before interrupting what seemed to be a lovely afternoon snack, with such an unwelcoming display of service. Would not recommend this location.

"Terrible service, just terrible. Before our drinks even came there was a bird pooping onto our table but the staff couldn't care less (perhaps because we're an ""ethnic"" family). Both the wait staff, and someone, who I assume is the manager, were extremely rude and very unapologetic. Sure, they couldn't do anything about the bird, but they could have, at the very least, let us move the table slightly, to avoid unwanted filth falling directly into our food and drinks. After a long while of this absurdity, the staff (very reluctantly), moved us to another table (inside this time). By this point though, this place had completely ruined our mood, both by the staff's deliberate avoidance of our issues, and their continued insolence. As a party of 7, we ordered a variety of dishes. Again, the food was not only subpar, but actually unenjoyable. In fact, we all concluded that we had had substantially better food elsewhere. Overall, not going back. Somehow, their blatant ignorance of our concerns during the service, and the unapologetic 'gtfo' attitude towards us (and to no other patrons present there at the time) is quite evident of a very bigotedly racist attitude embodied in this rather unremarkable eatery. As a paying customer, it's disappointing to be treated as a 'lesser person' in this day and age.

"Worst experience with a hairdresser ever, at this location. Made an appointment with Diane for a body wave. When I was sort of greeted by her she looked at my hair and said ""You get body waves"" Yeah, that's why I booked one at your salon. Then she argued with me about when to trim, I wanted after she wanted before, and after five minutes acknowledged that it didn't matter, but FIRST telling me the perm ""wouldn't soak in"" on the ends unless she trimmed it. Then she argued with me about the rods. It's taken me over ten years to figure out with Aveda perm hairstylists what the perfect combo is. Diane knew better, but finally agreed. Then she proceeded to comb my wet hair, from the forehead back, scratching my scalp and jerking my head. That wasn't enough, though. She then started rolling it with the rods she thought I should have.  I got up and left. When I addressed the problem at the front, NO EFFORT WAS MADE TO HELP me other than to offer coming back and talking to the owner. Yeah. Right. THAT'S gonna happen. Horrible salon...dirty, also, just as a side note.

"I went here for the first time on a recommendation. I did not request a specific stylist, and told them I could do an appointment ""any time this week."" I received a decent cut, but left promising the receptionist that I would NEVER return.Online, their women's haircut price is quoted at $30+. I get a very basic cut, so I expected it to be $30, $35 at most. Only when I checked out was I informed that my cut was actually $44. When I asked why the cost was so much higher than their base quote, the receptionist told me the cost is based on the experience of the stylist. My stylist -- the one chosen for me WITHOUT revealing this policy -- has been working at the salon for 13 years.I understand this unit of commensuration -- although, I think it's bad for business because it insinuates a customer will receive a much lower quality experience if the stylist is younger. However, if this is a salon policy, it is one that should be CLEARLY stated upon scheduling the appointment.From my perspective, La Pomponnee preyed upon my naivety and (seemingly deliberately) chose the most expensive stylist. This is downright terrible customer service, and it will be the reason they eliminated any chance of a long-term relationship.

"I was new in town and needed an eyebrow wax. I found the Spa at Ballantyne and decided to give it a try. Although I received a skewer of yummy pinneaple while I was waiting for my technician that was the highlight of my expereince. We got in the room and after what seemed like just two strips pulled off she said I was done. She didn't have a mirror in the room so she said I could use a metal bowl to try and see my reflection or we could go into the bathroom and she could tweeze and strays in there. Are you kiddingThis wouldnt have been so bad if it was super cheap, but the waxing was $20 and then they add automatic tip on there so it came to $24. There are many places less expensive or where you get more for your money.

"I was so surprised as to the level of disappointment I experienced at this spa. My best friend and I (she flew in from NJ for a visit and we planned a girls' day) went to this spa for 1 hour massages, both of us choosing hot stone. We both have experienced this type and other kinds of massages in many different places, NJ, NY, California to name a few.Here are my main issues:1- we are greeted by a very nice woman who does not understand or speak English. We ask questions and we are answered 'yes' every time. When we asked about the spa pools (are they hot or cold water) we get a 'yes'. I ask again, are they hot We get a yes. SHe leaves and we touch the water and both pools are ice cold. We find the hot tub, figure it out ourselves and the jets, which do not move, are facing straight up, therefore making a huge mess and we can't sit in front of the jets to loosen up any muscles. It was a joke.2- the hallway from the pools to the locker room is so sterile, I thought I was in a hospital.3- my massage, was all about the stones. My very nice therapist added hot stones then removed them over and over again for 50 minutes. SHe didn't massage anything. I kept on waiting for the manipulation to start, thinking she was maybe warming me up and relaxing my muscles and she was going to start the actual massage any second. Then we were done. What the heck  My friend's massage included an actual massage.4- the tranquility room is an open space right off the showers. there is no tranquil anything about this 'room'. No soft lighting, no blankets (I was quite chilly), no anything to make me feel I was in a special place to enjoy my quiet time.5- the pleasure of this experience, and i use that term kindly, cost me a whopping $175.  I haven't felt THIS ripped off in a very long time.If you are used to a special experience and you feel you deserve to be pampered and be made to feel good, Do Not Go Here unless you don't care where your money goes.

"UPDATE: I mailed a letter to the spa director with our list of complaints. I was surprised when I received a phone call from the director. He wanted to discuss our experience and promised that they were in a transition, updating the spa, etc. He refunded our money and offered us a massage at no cost so that we could be impressed and change our minds about this place. We were looking forward to a great experience, as promised and I fully planned on updating my rating here on Yelp.So, I called last week to book our appointments only to find that the director is no longer with the spa. I left a message with the spa manager and after several days she has yet to return my call. I guess the good service left with the director.

"It takes a lot for me to give a nasty review, and this place earns it.I was in town for a mini reunion - 4 of my friends from all over the US met here to catch up (after 20 years!).  I have lived all over the world, and appreciate spa's of all sorts and facilities....and always the main thing comes back to service.First, the greeting here was nice.  We had reservations for our treatments and confirmed at the desk then went on the tour. The facilities are wonderful.  Very posh.  Beautiful pools, indoor and out, and the spa was relaxing and comfortable.Now with posh places, they can often miss the point of actual ""treatment"".  But keep in mind I go to a Korean spa in Los Angeles and get an old lady to scrub me down like a little dirty kid so that my skin glows.  Still, I expect the actual treatment.So I had a massage.  Can't go wrong with that - right  Well....maybe you can.  I choose the only man on staff, as I like a strong massage.  I can honestly say that he spent more time adjusting my blanket a million times then he did actually rubbing me.  It was almost annoying.  I was ready to rip the blanket off.  I'm here for a rub down, not fluffy adjustment of the blanket and how it covers me LOL.  So whatever....When I got back I asked my friends if their treatments were nice.  All said ""ok"" and I had wondered if they just didn't know better or didn't want to complain.  One did complain.  She said that she didn't get the hot oil head treatment.  Oh that's sucky - because it is an add on service and costs a little bit.  But she really wanted it.  Well it's not missing it that pissed me off....it's what the lady told her.  She basically told my friend ""well I totally forgot and I don't have time....but what a shame cuz I do a really good treatment"".  Well if that isn't the biggest f-you ever  She should have taken the time to DO it!Then we go to pay.  Well....now here is the part that totally had me trumped.  Like I said, I've been to spas on every single corner of this earth, and never before have I seen this done.  They basically add a 20% gratuity.  They PRE add it.  Then they say to you ""well, if you feel you want to give them less, we can change it"".  WOW WOW WOW!  So are you really suppose to feel like an jerk and say they deserve less  So first my friend - she told them to take off the charge for the service she didn't get, then said she did want to tip less since the girl made her feel bad.  They said to her ""well you know the tip get's shared by all of us"".  Oh my Lord.  My turn.  I say to her, well I've never heard of this being done before and it's kinda odd to shove the gratuity down our throats.  We all would have paid it anyhow, but it's the fact that we are demanded to without knowing that leaves a bad taste in our mouths.  I paid and didn't fight.But then...there was a local man standing in line waiting to pay too.  He said to the girl...""what can I bitch about to try to get a discount"".  WOW.  Is this really how these locals act  He didn't know our situation.  He didn't know how we were treated.  So my friend who lives there turned around and said something to him - basically to mind his own business.  The girl behind the counter LAUGHED.Oh no.  In the car, my friend called several times to speak to a manager.  They kept sending her to voicemail. She left two voicemails.  NO call back.You can have the prettiest little southern spot and posh trimmings, but the meat is your treatments and your service.  In my booked you failed on both.

"I treated my mom and myself to Sea Pearl Facials, Bottoms Up Pedicures, and Luxury Manicures on April 1st, 2014, at the Spa. I have lived in the Ballantyne area for years; however, this was my first visit to the Spa at Ballantyne. Overall, we were very satisfied with every service we received. We were welcomed and had a full tour of the facilities upon arrival. I personally had Leigh for my facial, and she was amazing. She talked with me at length about my skin type, the products that would work well, and the experience was incredibly relaxing. I have had facials before, but this is the best one I've ever had. My mom was equally satisfied with her service, and said she could have stayed on the table forever. I had Choyoung for my bottoms up pedicure and luxury manicure. She was an expert, and sought to ensure comfort at every step! My mom and I had these together, and it was a great experience - relaxing, refreshing, and lots of good chatter. We had a beautiful view of the golf course, and were sipping complimentary Pomegranate Martinis during these services. I have not been doing a manipedi on a regular basis, but am considering adding this on a monthly basis. Choyoung was very welcoming, friendly, and efficient. The only part of our day that really irritated me was our checkout. After gathering our things from the locker room, we came back up to check out. My mother went into the shop to browse while I waited to pay. There was one customer at the desk actively engaged in a conversation with the man behind the desk. There was a woman behind the desk also, not participating in the discussion, but seemed like she was politely listening. She clearly saw us walk up, and my mother go into the shop. I stood there for a bit, expecting that since the other customer was actively engaged in conversation with the other staff member, she would respond but did not. I almost said 'excuse me', but given I do customer service for a living as well, I wanted to see how long she would ignore me. I continued to stand there, and finally she (Lindsey) greeted me. I must say she was the most cold and rude person I encountered at the Spa. She presented me with the itemized bill before charging my card with $700 in services and a forced 20% gratuity (I normally tip 20% and would have anyway, but it's nice for the customer to have that choice), and then focused back on the previous conversation while she was printing receipts. It was almost as if I was a bother to her. After I received my receipt, I started to walk into the shop, and I heard her greet the person behind me with a totally different attitude. After the fantastic service received from all of their services staff throughout the day, it was not something I expected at the end. It goes to show you that a borderline rude customer experience at the end can ruin the entire impression of a business. Additionally, I sent this feedback in e-mail to the Spa, and heard absolutely nothing from them...not even a 'sorry'.

"Over crowded, loud, and not a relaxing experience. Stayed at the hotel and booked two massages. Was looking forward to a tranquil  environment, sadly that did not happen. The service was below par and did not measure up to the quality of the hotel. I was not told about the facilities available, it was loud, crowded, I was told I could relax after massage with my husband, that did not happen, and checking in was not smooth. Sadly not worth the money or time.

"I made a reservations for my bf and i at the spa on 61414 to have a relaxing Day but they gave me a stressful week. It was a really nice place. i was planning to go again but not anymore.I was very disappointed when i found out that i got charged twice and got 2 overdraft fees because of the spa and the amount was  different compared to the first time being charged also my bf got charged and it was a different amount too. I think this was fraud because they charged our cards different amounts without our authorization. I received a refund a week later from the spa after several disputes.

"Mediocre overpriced threading. Maybe I'm spoiled by my shabby little nailsthreading place in New York, but Modern-Phillips Place charged me $70+ for what would be $30-40 in NY (compare business rents). Sodi threaded my face in no particular order so I ended up with strays. It scared me to death the way she hopped between my sideburns and my brows--you can lose half a brow that way. No consultation on the shaping. MEDIOCRE brow shaping with rows of sticking out hairs along the curve. She did that way too rapidly with tweezers (so I guess she can't really do the fine work of threading a brow). The edge of a properly shaped brow should be perfectly sharp but also natural as if it grew that way. Holes should appear to be filled in magically. My brows also now sit a bit unevenly on my face. She wears a magnifier and this may give her a peephole view that is inadequate to perceive the overall shape, but it should have allowed her to create a totally smooth edge and NO STRAYS.No pre-sanitation or post-care of the skin.A mark where she caught my skin in her thread.Plus, cold rude staff.

"I waited a few months to review because my experience was so bad, I am hoping things have changed by now. I booked my appointment with a third level 'color specialist' to darken my hair a bit, light brown to a solid auburn. After ratting my hair in a knot and then trying to brush it out, more like ripping, and telling me ""pain is beauty"" numerous times, my hair turned out 2 different shades. The top half being orange and the bottom being orange red. When asked what I thought, I pointed out the two different shades and how orange my hair was. I was told he would put something else on it to even it out. Second time around, still really brassy and two shades. Third time, I said just to go dark brown because we weren't getting it right and I had been there for 3 hours already. I get my hair done every 8 to 12 weeks and have never had an experience like this. The hairdresser was so focused on his personal issues, which I heard about, that I don't think he was paying attention to what he was doing. Safe to say, I was really upset and disappointed when I left. The rest of the staff seemed really nice and the place was pretty and clean, maybe I just caught the hairdresser on a bad day

"I got my hair cut here about a month ago. During the shampooing my scalp began to feel a little tingly but no biggie. By the time I sat in the stylist's chair though it felt as if my scalp was on fire. My ears were bright red and anywhere else that the wet hair had touched my face turned the skin bright red. Clearly I was having a bad reaction to their Aveda-only products.  The stylist got very concerned and, appropriately, brought over the salon manager. The clearly unconcerned heard-it-before manager said that she, too, had a bad reaction to their products as did some other customers and that I ""might want to take a Benadryl"" when I got home.  End of story! Not ""how can we make it better for you"" Not ""Oh I am so sorry this happened!"" Take a Benedryl. That and they charged me full price for my miserable experience - maybe they felt that they had to recoup the cost of rinsing my head againAny service professional that doesn't understand the importance of customer service will not get my money again.

"I went in for a simple, everyday, ordinary haircut. TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY THREE (that's $273.00) later, I came home with products I just HAD-TO-HAVE pushed on me like drug dealers by everyone from the stylist, the shampoo girl, the facial girl, the counter girls, who just wouldn't take ""NO"" for an answer and are very well-trained to ""put you on the spot"" in front of other customers so as to embarrass you, and ""trick"" you into buying something you really don't need just to boost their commission sales. Jennifer hasn't the foggiest notion how to properly complete a man's haircut. She neglected to trim the sideburns, ear, nose, eyebrow, and neck hair, even though I asked her, to which she responded, ""We have people who do that!"" (for an extra charge!) and suggested I spend more money to have another girl wax these areas. WTF Are you kidding me here REALLY On the lighter note, I am getting a so-called complimentary facial. Definitely a place where you should prepare yourself to be accosted by staff to spend more money!

"Worst pedicure ever. The polish bubbled and never cured properly. Besides making a mess of the job, the stylist lathered on a lot of artificial flattery and tried to pressure me to buy a bunch of unnecessary over-priced random products.  But all that I needed when I left this place was a new pedicure--which I gave to myself with some drugstore polish.  Never ever again will I go here!  Absolutely horrible experience.

"I came to Snail Motorsports with the intent to have 2 strollers powder coated and media blasted but unfortunately I ended up having to ask for a refund and not have them do any work. I was really upset by the whole situation because I was really looking forward to having some custom powder coating done by someone who has done numerous amount of work for my friends. Juan the powder coater has done frames and rims for several friends, so when I started asking around for who to take my items to everyone referred me to snail Motorsports.When I took my items to snail Motorsports I was first quoted $370.00 to media blast 18 items and custom powder coat 6 items. I thought that was a little high so they reworked the numbers and came back with $240, I still thought that was a little high but i agreed to have it done and I payed half up front and left the items. As i pondered about everything throughout the day, I decided to look over the receipt and do some math. I noticed that for a simple powder coat I was been charged $5 per item for a candy powder coat I was been charged $15 and for media blasting I was been charged $10. I then though to myself what if i got everything powder coated and some number crunching late it would roughly be $260 to powder coat everything could this be a $20 difference to have everything done I called snail Motorsports and explained to them what I had came up with and I asked if the price to powder coat all my pieces would be $260 I was shocked when the answer came about the price to powder coat 2 strollers would be $600.00!! What i was so shocked with that sticker prices that I just sent an email and asked for them to not do any work and that I would pick up my items.There is no way 2 strollers would cost $600.00 to powder coat its not 2 cars When i showed up the next day I was greeted by Juan's wife who quickly offered me back my parts, but also offered to get me another quote she came back with $480.00. While there was no explanation to why we would go from $240 to $480 if the pricing per item remained the same I just could not do business with someone who was so inconsistent in their pricing. I ended up calling several friends to find out if they have had similar experiences come to find out several friends explained how before Juan use to be someone who you could talk to and ask questions too. Now he is either just too good for people or he just doesn't have the time for them. That really sucks since some of my friends ended up telling me that they are sending stuff out of town to get done instead of having to deal with someone who has an ego.

"I bought a new set of wheels and took them to Snail Motorsports to be powdercoated. When I picked them up they were nicely shrunk wrapped and put back in the boxes.  The next day I took them down to the tire store to have them mount tires on them, but after I got home I realized that there were mounds on one side of each of the spokes where the powder was sprayed too heavy. I have had several people tell me how horrible they look, which makes me really angry after paying to have these ""professionally"" powdercoated.  There is nothing worse than bragging to your friends how nice the wheels are going to be, just to have them laugh when they see how bad they look.  Now I have to get a second set of wheels to use while I pay to have the tires unmounted and have someone that knows what they are doing strip them back down and re-coat them.

"This was my second visit and alas, my last. Our first visit was at lunch and it was just OK. We weren't blown away nor were we impressed. But I will always opt to support a local Mom & Pop shop if all things are equal. This last visit was the pits.It was 5:30pm on a Saturday night. We were one of two tables. This is usually an indication of something fishy (excuse the pun.) Appetizer was edamame. It was overcooked and left uneaten. I am not the adventurous sushi order-er; I had California rolls and spicy tuna. The tuna rolls were mostly spicy sauce then fish, very mayonnaise-y and unsatisfying. As for my CA rolls, the avocado was all brown! Not just the parts on the top (because I checked!) all the way through. When I brought it to the staff's attention her response was ""Oh, yea. Avocado is like banana. They get brown very easily and we cut that yesterday."" WHAT! They did bring me another batch (that was part brown, part green) but it was too late. This was my first sushi restaurant EVER that we left half the rolls on the plate uneaten. Since we were all still hungry, my daughter picked up the table tent listing all the desserts. Yuck! Filthy. Not wiped down in a long while or perhaps ever. When I set it back is when I noticed the wall also needed a good wipe down. Needless to say, we skipped dessert. Our first visit deserved a 2.5 but this visit was a 1.

"Benihana.  It's just rolls off the tongue, doesn't it  No, unfortunately not.at.all...anymore.  From hence forth, all mentions of Benihana are likely to cause anxiety in my usually calm heart.  I hate complaining like this. I really do. But sometimes, you just have to, ya knowTuesday evening I met a group of friends for a birthday dinner.  The reservation for our party of nine was for 7:00pm.  All but one of our party arrived prior to 7:00, but the hostess was curt in explaining that all party members needed to be present before we were seated, as our chef would be ready to begin meal preparation as soon as we were seated.  Fortunately, the final member of our party arrived shortly and we were seated at 7:05pm.  It was not until 7:40pm that first contact with our server was made. Without any apology for the delay she took our drink orders.  She (name withheld because I don't want to be rude) returned more than 10 minutes later with our drinks, but waited another 10-15 minutes after that to take our dinner orders.  As I was waiting I looked over at the table next to us, who were also clearly celebrating a child's birthday.  At one point the mother (I'm assuming) smiled at me and said, ""I hope you get out before midnight. We've been here over two hours.  We're taking our cake and getting out of here.""Upon taking our orders, one of our guests explained that due to a shrimp allergy it was necessary to cook any shrimp ordered by our group in another area (a neighboring grill, etc.).  Our server said that she would have to ask the manager, who came to our table shortly thereafter.  When the manager arrived at the table my guest explained her allergy and his response was that it might be in her best interest to leave.  I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt that he meant leaving the table, not the restaurant, but I'm not certain of this. Following this recommendation he mentioned that she could wait in the bar as the rest of us dined table-side.  I asked him why it was not an option to prepare the shrimp at a neighboring table, but he expressed concern that other customers may require the use of the other available tables.  I understand his point, but the restaurant was near-empty as the hour quickly approached 8:30pm.  Finally, he offered to prepare the shrimp portions of our meals in the kitchen.  I'm not sure why this wasn't initially mentioned as an option, but I'll leave it at that.  Our chef Tom eventually arrived at our table. He was very pleasant and efficient during the course of our meal preparation.  During his time at the table my Emperor's Salad was delivered, as were the majority of my table's sushi orders.  However, two of our guests that ordered sushi were not served at this time.  In fact, they were not served until a full 10 minutes after the rest of our party finished our meals.  At one point, they inquired about the delay to she-whose-name-shall-not-be-mentioned, who responded that they were ""waiting for the rice.""  When she delivered their food there was not a single mention of the delay.  Two hours and thirty+ minutes after we arrived at Benihana, we left.  From start to finish, the entire evening was a terrible experience.  It was ridiculous to the point that there was not even soap or toilet paper available in the restroom.  Were it not for the kindness and professionalism of Tom (and the awesome company of friends), the night would have been a complete waste.  My final thought is this. The food was fine, but because I was feeling particularly piggish on this Tuesday evening, I enjoyed two California rolls from my stash of Costco sushi at home before departing for the restaurant. The difference between Costco's rolls and Benihana's...a toss up - just sayin.  The good news is, this will give my friends something to whine about for YEARS to come...

If we ate the dinner as a whole it would've been cold.. So we ate as we went. Also drink refills were a tough task too.. the chef had to keep asking other servers to assist. few and far between!! We had 3 birthdays at our table.. Not one song , which I didn't care, not one complimentary picture, no dessert was offered until another customer said something. Then the bill.. Oh the bill... That took another 15 mins!! At this point I told my family to go ahead home and I will wait considering this overall experience was almost a 2 hour ordeal. I was double charged on two items. At this point I was DONE dealing with this incompetent and appethetic waiter!!! Went to settle my bill with the manager who was nice and accommodating. Rectified the errors. And was generous with a $20 refund! I told him about the experience and all he said was ""I can take picture now for you"" UM... I was by myself!!! No thanks! One last thing, the male greeter needs some drug intervention.. He was high as a kite and made my daughter & I feel very uncomfortable to the point of invading our personal space and staring with those glazed over eyes as he staggered to and from his post. WOW & BOO!!! And sad : (

"This is by the far the worst hibachi restaurant I have eaten at. The food is very bland from the onion soup to the fried rice (which basically was white rice with chopped onions) to the chicken (which was so pale it looked like it was boiled). Hibachi food typically has tons of flavor and tastes good because it has some grill marks and char, which none of our food had. I question whether it was even cooked on the hibachi table (we ate at a regular table but ordered from the hibachi menu). Not only was the food bad but the service was terrible. Our waiter didn't even know that hibachi dinners should come with the two sauces, he acted confused when I asked for them. Additionally, we ordered a sushi roll for an appetizer and instead of getting it before dinner, we received it after our dinner even though we saw it sitting at the sushi bar for a good 15 minutes beforehand. This restaurant may have been around for a long time but it doesn't even compare to other hibachi restaurants and was more expensive than any other I've eaten at.

"This is the WORST Hibachi I have ever had.  We came here for a friends birthday, and I will never be going back. Service was mediocre, but the food was the real travesty.You go to Hibachi for a show, but it's not fun when the cook makes the SAME Giant Eagle joke the entire time.  He also couldn't perform all the tricks that are pretty standard from Hibachi chefs.  The food. Not good.  My boyfriend ordered tofu and it was cold in the middle.  He didn't bother to have the guy heat it more, bc it would have just been a hassle.  The chef forgot one friends meal completely and got rude with the server.  Then after everything was cooked, he looked at me and asked did you eat all your shrimp. I replied ""no, you never served me any."" (I had ordered the chicken and shrimp.)  He then sends the server back into the kitchen to get more. By the time they were cooked, everyone was finished eating.  Come on.  To make matters worse, when we left we saw that he was the head chef. That doesn't say too much for the rest of them. I don't know how people keep coming here.  There is WAY better hibachi in Pittsburgh, for a lot less money.  I mean honestly, I paid $9.50 for a glass of Kendall Jackson. No. The best part of the meal were the cupcakes that my friend brought.  Do your wallet and your stomach a favor and go to a different Hibachi place.  Benihana is not worth your time or money.

"My family and I have been going to Benihana for about 5 years now. We've always had to wait at least a half an hour to be seated, even when we've had reservations. In the past its been forgivable, mostly because its close to home for us, the food is okay (albeit a little pricey), and my Grandmother absolutely loves the entertainment of hibachi. But that all changed last night when we went out with a party of 8 for my and my mothers birthday. I made reservations two weeks in advance for our birthday dinner. When I called they were almost totally booked and only had a few spots left that evening. Our reservations were for 7:30. We arrive a little early at 7:20 and I let the hostess know that we are there and she checks us in. Then we basically just wait and wait and wait. We notice the hostess turning people away, and we notice two tables who have been seated for about 30 minutes now haven't even gotten their soups or salads. By now its nearly 8 O'clock. Then my mother overhears the hostess telling someone that they are short staffed and the wait is going to be extremely long. By this point we've been waiting for 45 minutes. My sister takes a walk through the restaurant and notices there is only 1 hibachi chef working, but there are SEVEN tables seated, all waiting for fooddrinks. So I ask the hostess how much longer before we are seated. She informs me that it will be at least another half an hour before we get a table, because two hibachi chefs and two kitchen chefs called off sick. It would be another hour after were seated before they would even start taking our food orders. This is TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE. First of all, the hostess should have informed us when we arrived that they were short staffed and we would have a very very long wait. OR, the manager should have phoned people with reservations and asked if they could reschedule. Either way, we should have been informed instead of letting us stand in the lobby for an hour, not knowing that it would be another hour and a half before we would actually eat, on an evening when we had reservations. We decided to call Ichiban to see if they could accommodate us. They told us we could walk right in and be seated immediately. As we were leaving we ran into a gentleman who was outside smoking who told us that his party had reservations for 6:30 and they still had not ordered their food! It was now about 8:20pm. Our first dinner at Ichiban actually turned out to be much better than our previous dinners at Benihana, so I don't think we'll ever be going back there. I think Ichiban will be our new hibachi restaurant of choice.

"I'm sorry, but as cool as Andy is, I just don't like the sushi.  The tuna tasted metallic and mealy, definitely not fresh.  I actually spit it out in my napkin upon first bite.  The portions are large, yes, and the prices are good, but I'd rather pay a little more for sushi that is less suspect.
",0
"First, do not call me sexy and then give me the two most sinewy pieces of toro possible. That pissed me right off. Second, the rolls here are sloppy. Not only did it fall apart very quickly (and was about 4 times too large to eat: a piece of sushi should be able to be comfortably eaten in one bite), but it seems there isn't much thought given to flavors as far as the special rolls go. After my experience with the toro, I don't think I will be giving any sashimi or  *sushi* sushi rolls a try. While the rolls are large, the prices were quite steep, not what i was expecting for someone based in a market that sells seafood.

"Ew! Ew! Gross! I know that's not the most mature thing to say, but that's what comes to mind when I think about this place! Sad thing is, I've been here a couple times. Every time I kept thinking it would somehow get better, but no, it doesn't! The Miso soup they serve has this weird after taste, and to be honest, doesn't taste like any Miso soup I've EVER had! So on to the sushi, oh yeah, it's gross too! I think I kept going back because the size of the rolls are humongous. The thing is the fish does NOT taste fresh at all! It's always luke warm and....just.not.good. Oh well, I tried. But I'd suggest you not!

"Absolutely the worst sushi my husband and I have ever had.  It was Gross!!! I don't know why they use so much rice or why the fish wasn't cold.  You couldn't pay me to go back to this place!

"If you're in the mood for fresh, tasty sushi, this is not the place for you. The food that was delivered to us was simply inedible. Point blank. My husband and I ordered a bunch of sushi for dinner with the plan of having tasty leftovers for lunch the next day, so we splurged a little, spent like $60 on various rolls. The presentation was pretty pathetic - wilting nori, leading us to believe these rolls were pre-made; hot pink ginger, meaning it's the MSG-soaked kind; glue-like rice, where you can't see the individual grains - but what really horrible was the smell. When we took the lid off the tray, the stench of rotten fish knocked both if us back. I honestly gagged.It was so awful, we just stared at each other, amazed that we just spent our money on a pile of stinking rot. Determined to not waste everything, I picked up a piece of spider roll to sniffinspecttry. IT HAD A HUGE HAIR IN IT, all wound around the crab. Totally disgusting. My husband attempted to try the inari - just tofu and rice, right It tasted like rotten fish, as it had absorbed all the smells from the other fish rolls. We had also ordered a vegetable and tofu soup, and a green salad with ginger dressing. Can't even believe this, but the salad leaves were brown and slimy on the ends! They actually screwed up a green salad. The soup tasted like the inside of an aluminum pot, all metallic and burnt-flavored. Horrible, horrible, horrible. We literally dumped everything down the garbage disposal. Total waste.We tried to call and complain, but by the time our order was delivered, the place was closed. We will be calling again today to get our money back. Maybe they will earn themselves another star if they do the right thing and refund our money.

"Don't bother with the sushi, can't speak to the Korean BBQ.Long story short: I ordered delivery. Never had sushi delivered before, so maybe this is just the way it goes, but it took almost two hours to get to me. There was condensation inside the sushi container from the rolls sitting on top of the other entree I'd ordered (which was hot) and being held against it in a small bag. Assuming that the rolls were made long before I got them, I just threw out the tuna roll, which was warmer than room temp anyway. Vegetable roll was good, but not exceptional. Fried rice was...just not what I expected, not exceptional either. In short, I paid almost $40 for a cucumber roll and two bites of rice. Maybe this is better when you dine in. Still, would not recommend. Pricey and doesn't live up to it at all.

"Being Korean and my kids and I visit all the Korean restaurants when we are out of town.  Since my daughter goes to PITT we wanted to treat our daughter to Korean food.  My family including my wife who is non- Korean always order    and if this is how they want to represent Korean food to others they are doing disservice to our heritage.   was the worst I have ever had.  Their  had lettuce as one of mixing choices and their meat was hamburger meat  Will not go back.

"I am sorry to say that this place still STINKS.  I work in the strip and often get temped by Sushi Kim.  I stopped in for lunch today and I was the only person in the whole place.  That should have tipped me off.  The last time i was there i had a bad meal, but i wanted to give them another shot.  I ordered the spicy chicken off of the lunch menu.  I believe is was L1......Numbered menu items.....Another tip.   My food was terrible.  The miso soup was horrid and old, the sides were awful and everything seemed to be microwaved.  AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS!!!

"Tried this place based on reviews in local paper and friends. This place was awful. We asked questions of the server and ordered based on them. Neither was good.y friend said she cannot eat real spicy food and asked them to tone it down. Her meal was so hot she couldn't eat it.  Mine was just disappointing. The only thing I found good was the plain rice. I also thought it was extremely over priced. Will not return.

"Coming from the west coast, this is probably the worst sushi I have had in a very long time. There are no descriptions for any of the rolls. They do not offer low sodium soy sauce. The wait for 3 rolls and 4 pieces of sashimi took over 25 minutes. Now for the food, the scallop roll is mushy ( if they were scallops I wouldn't know). Actually, everything I ate was mushy. The service was inattentive. I waited 10 minutes for a refill for my iced tea, after the owner and another server looked straight at my empty glass.

"FILET MIGNON NOT AS ADVERTISEDWe ordered the filet mignon with chicken hibachi.  The flavor was ok, we asked for the filet to be medium and it arrived well done, was very chewy and we suspect a chuck roast or some other inferior cut of beef was substituted for the filet.  False advertising at its best--shouldn't that be illegalThe fried rice that came with it was ok but we were not offered a choice of steamed rice or noodles.  Other hibachi places we have been to plate noodles and steamed or fried rice together.The miso soup was very salty and murky and not very flavorful.  The salad had a lot of water at the bottom of the bowl and was made up of head lettuce only (anyone ever heard of a salad spinner)--not very appetizing.We also ordered sushi (all cooked ingredients) it was just ok and not the best I have experienced.The waitress was slow and had to be asked for refills on our hot tea.  The whole meal took almost an hour and a half and cost $75.00 tip included.  Not worth the price, time, gas and wear and tear on the car to get there.

"Date & Time of Visit:  May 21, DinnertimeI don't know what this place was thinking with their eighty-five-dollar, eight-course tasting menu.  That menu had microscopic-size courses and the taste, after the first two (2) courses, were repetitive--and mostly on the sweet side.  Moreover, the place has the sticky feel that one would associate with divey restaurants.  As for their restroom, only one and a unisex one at that.  And yes, there was urine on the floor.

"This used to be our favorite place when we first moved to Pittsburgh two years ago.  It had good quality fish and a nice atmospherecool staff.  As of our last visit, about two months, ago, the menu still had not changed, the portions of fish were smaller while prices stayed the same, and the atmosphere was on par with that of a Hofbrauhaus.  A drunken man knocked into our table on his way storming out of the restaurant which was immediately proceeded by the members of two different large tables rising from their chairs and yelling obscenities at each other.  It literally looked like there was going to be a brawl.  The members of these tables fairly quickly left the restaurant; however, the staff and manager simply acted as if nothing had happened.  No one came by to see if things had spilled on our table which was run into.  It was absolutely not the experience we expected to have, and it is a disappointment that this place has gone downhill.

"Please don't go here. I'm begging you. I wouldn't wish this place on my own worst enemy. I wouldn't wish this on the girl who cheated on my best friend. This place was a literal nightmare. .I think I've been to Jimmy Wan's 4 times this month, so I was sick of it. Plus I'd heard good things about TaiPei, so I thought I'd give it a whirl.The service was abysmal - my waiter took 10 minutes to recognize I'd sat down. He was very kind, but only dropped my food off. No ""how's it going"", no water refills, no offer of dessert or other courses. A kind busboy kept refilling my drink. The portions are extremely small - I've never seen such tiny sushi rolls in my life. The menu says there's a charge for fried rice instead of white. Huh. Jimmy Wan's offers white and brown, no extra charge. Interesting.The atmosphere was atrocious.  A family in the table to my left and in front let their child (6 or 7, mind you) take off his shoes and walk around. He then ground his heel into the carpet - with a piece of chicken in between. He swiped a cloth napkin from an empty table and rubbed it all over his feet. I audibly gasped, but his obese mother couldn't hear me or ignored me. Then she threatened to take each of their Kindles away if they didn't shut up. The boy was eating with salad tongs instead of a fork all night long.The waitstaff saw what was happening and didn't care at all. My waiter didn't show up after I was finished with my meal and when he did (after I'd requested someone else get him) he failed to clear my dirty plates. I finally told the owner how terrible the whole thing was - namely the ambiance and the service and she asked if I wanted anything to go and apologized for being busy. You...think I want something to go How were 15 people in the 50 seat restaurant and one small takeout order. How....is that busyOther reviews have mentioned that the ownership has changed hands. If you care about your health, don't go to a restaurant where the waitstaff doesn't care if children grind chicken into the carpet. If they find that behavior outside of the kitchen normal, can you imagine what they do inside the kitchen I have no doubt little handwashing goes on and much wiping of noses while cooking.Jews, don't go here on Christmas, even if though they loudly advertise they're open. If 15 people means they're ""busy"", can you imagine what it'll be like on ChristmasThe slowness of the whole establishment is astounding. I dropped my little brother off at Jimmy Wan's immediately before going to TaiPei - a 15 second drive between establishments. Wan's parking lot was jam packed and he ate with 9 other friends. He called me to pick him up as I was paying the bill. How the hell did TaiPei take as long as Jimmy Wan's did to seat and serve and bill 10 people as they did me, the 15th person in their restaurantOnly go here if you have a death wish or are a practicing masochist.

"I used to frequent Tai Pei once a week or so, but within the last few years, it has gone severely downhill. The food is greasy, way too expensive, and they use massive amounts of MSG. I got terrible MSG poisoning from Tai Pei and ever since then, have gone to Jimmy Wan's down the road.

"We visited with a Groupon last Thursday. We ordered the Hot and Sour Seafood Soup, the black bean chicken, szechuan beef, and lamb with scallions. The soup was awesome! Very spicy!The rest of the food was awful. It was tasteless... the meat had a weird fluffy texture.... there was zero flavor. It was actually so bad that we asked to talk to the manager. He said the kitchen would make new dishes. They brought three new entrees. They were again completely flavorless, but warmer. I couldn't taste salt or pepper  or garlic or even feel any heat. It was awful. We paid and left. yuck. I used to go here as a child. I remember the sushi was always good. Maybe that is the thing to order!

"Dropped into Cosmos last night for dinner before the Michael Buble concert.  It was a nightmare.  First and foremost, they were serving a limited, special event menu.  Not a huge deal except the concept of a limited menu is to reduce the variety of entrees being prepped so you can get meals out of the kitchen faster when the place is packed.  Four diners at my table and all three entrees and my salad (more on that shortly) arrived at different times with the last one arriving 10 minutes after the first.  And brought to the table without apology.  So why did I order a salad  Becuase I wanted an entree with chicken as the protein and there was not a single chicken entree on the limited menu (I am not counting the chicken and shrimp jambalaya).  I also didn't appreciate that they served olives with the pits in a salad...a recipe for cracked or chipped dental work.  Lastly, our waiter forgot our drinks and bread after several requests  and then messed up our bills (yes, we split checks...shame on us).  If you are going to go through the trouble of doing a special event menu to accomodate a crowd then round out the preparations by staffing appropriately (in the kitchen and the dining room).

"I went here with a social group for drinksmeal on a Thursday evening. We had the upstairs reserved just for us. The atmosphere was comfortable. The downstairs [outside of our group] was dead. The physical layout of this place is impressive. On the outside, it looks like a corner business. But its really a full restaurant with an upstairs area. Anyways back to the actual experience. They served food upstairs for our group, which was cool, but you had to put your credit card down as a tab. [Not an issue]. The bar selection is ok. The food was ok. The issue I have with this place is that when you go to pay out, they give you a post swiped transaction. This is the receipt that shows the total, card transaction details, tip, and total. They did not give a receipt detailing the full itemized service. After requesting the receipt and giving a quick look at it I paid, and put down a tip. After looking at the receipt later, it turns out that there was a gratuity charge already added to the receipt. I find this to be very deceptive and FRAUDULENT. Adding grautity to a bill doesn't bother me. It bothers me when 1. it was never stated that would be there, 2. when you don't have sitdown service with a waiter [the social group I was with was more of freeflowing in the bar area] To add insult to injury, they try to play the club vibe outside. They put up velvet ropes, and use a door man. There was no line, and secondly, giving an impression of an ""exclusive club"" is a joke when there is only a handful of people at the bar downstairs. Vibe: DeadFood: DecentDrinks: Typical selectionDrink price: $5 for a beer.

"Having limited options in Uptown I gave this place a few chances.  It's just not good.  I got some eel that wasn't fresh and I haven't been able to eat eel since.  I also think their miso soup is actually chicken broth with some miso tossed in.

"Probably the only restaurant that the service was so terrible that I have left before getting my food. Me and my boyfriend went here with a groupon, that we had purchased specifically for Fujo. They refused to take it, and the manager told us, ""you have two choices, ask for a refund from groupon or just eat here without it."" If we had been rude then I wouldn't be able to blame him, but we had politely and calmly spoke to them and asked about it. We walked out and went to Emzy for sushi instead and it had great service and excellent food.

"This was absolutely terrible.  It was so highly reviewed, but absolutely terrible.  Not that we ate the food, because we never had a chance.  We were seated immediately in an area with another table that was served by our server.  There were only two tables taken in the restaurant and our server took 10+ minutes to bring us drinks.  Still waiting on our drinks, our appetizer came out with no silverware, no plates, still no drinks.  Our server came by (we had already asked him about the drinks once).  Shortly thereafter, he brought the drinks, still no plates and no silverware.  We waited a few more minutes and he brought out our salads.  Still no plates and no silverware.  When we asked again about the plates, he laughed as though we had made some strange request.  We continued to wait - no chopsticks, no silverware, no plates - after it became too ridiculous to handle we got up and walked out  It's the only place that we've ever done that before - and we have had some terrible service.  The food that we stared at looked terrible - in hindsight I'm glad that we had no utensils.  If you have an hour to kill, are looking for terrible service, aren't in a rush, and want to order some food that looks disgusting you may want to check it out; otherwise, stay away!

The owner of the parking lot says its not his problem either.So, my $30 meal just got a $120 tax added on to it.

"This review is about the FOOD only! I'm in town and without a vehicle so naturally I was looking up some tasty delivery options on yelp, when I came across cuisine malaya, I was elated to see that they delivered.  I got my food fast, both dishes came in very nice containers and I was sure i was in for a real treat! Based on other reviewers I had the steamed Popiah  and the beef Char kway teow..Back to the opening of the containers.... First the steamed popiah, I'll admit I have never had popiah before and they probably would have been better if they were fried.   The popiah consisted of a thick roll stuffed with mostly rice and some other ingredients, it was topped and garnished very nicely, the problem is.... It didn't taste like anything!!!  I'm a firm believer in not eating tasteless food.   The char kway teow was similar in appearance to pad see ewe but again, this dish was tasteless..... I mean I couldn't taste any flavors! How does this even happen Did they forget to add flavor to my meal  I ended up only eating a tiny amount of my food...  It's so sad when you have something that looks delicious, but turns out to be a barrel of bland.....

Everything started to fall apart once the original manager was forced to quit his position. The food quantity and quality started to go down hill. There was hair in my food not once but TWICE every time I order a rice dish. The new owner did not care to apologize and he was offended I even brought it up. The sushi is very plain and not high quality either. As a college student, they forget to discount our meal from time to time but its the food that matters right Their prices are constantly changing and for the amount of the food it is not reasonable. We will not be coming back at all. There are other places to go that actually care about their customers satisfaction.

"I booked her for my daughter's party, and she double-booked herself. Now I know the reason she asks YOU to call and confirm the day before your party. Then she made it seem as if I misunderstood her when our entire ""booking"" conversation was well documented by text messages. I don't think there is a way for me to misunderstand the words ""my other client fell through, I'm available for your party"". Luckily the lady she pawned me off on ended up being available and amazing. Look elsewhere.UPDATE 52812: I was going to leave my review as what it is - the truth. But now after receiving an email from this ""business"" owner asking me to change my review, and NOW accusing me of sending someone I don't even know to rate her badly, I had to update and confirm that I absolutely stand by my 1st review. The owner sent me an email a few months back asking me to give her a better review because her life was busy w work and school or something (I already deleted email). It was more of a ""poor me"" email, than an apology. I thought...you know what, I'm not even replying to this because I'm a mother, full-time student, and have a full-time day job and I make it work. No excuses. Plus, her follow-up comment makes it seem like she knew she was over-booked, but planned to send me to another face-painter...That couldn't have been the case because when I called to ""confirm"" her presence at my party, she had no clue who I even was!! I had to explain every little detail of when we talked and who I was before she gave me a  to another face-painter HOPING (not knowing) whether this other person would be booked or not. So don't act like you had it all planned out and under control.  After skimming through her other reviews this morning, I see that now she thinks that any bad review must be from me or one of my minions. Let me say I have absolutely no idea who the other 1-star commenter is. I am connected as a friend on Yelp with everyone I do know, and its sad that I have to defend that fact.  If you look at any of my other reviews, you will see I gave out 4 or 5 stars for every other company, and that is because they deserved it. Bottom line, a business is a business, you aren't the only person trying to make it through this hectic life in one piece, run your business well in the future, and stop harassing me about my honest reviews.

I was going to a family wedding the next day in Texas and I really wanted to get my nails done before I left. When I called to make the appointment, I asked if they'd still be open that late considering that it was Halloween. The girl on the phone said yes and I made the appointment. I arrived at Cobblestone at 620pm. The whole place was empty and dark, but I could see someone still in the building. I went inside and spoke to Eileen who told me they were closed. I let her know I made an appointment and she went to check her book. She found my name but still said that they were closed. She said that she wanted to call me earlier that day to let me know they were closing early due to Halloween, but her receptionist didn't get my phone number.I left the spa very unhappy and the next day I went to the wedding in Texas without having my nails done. Upon my return to Tempe, I went back to Cobblestone. I spoke to Eileen again and expressed my displeasure. She apologized and asked me if I wanted to get my nails done that day. I said yes and she took me back for a manicure and pedicure right away. Eileen did a great job like always, and my nails looked very good.After my nails were finished, I went up to the front to pay and she only charged me for the manicure, giving me the pedicure for free. She apologized again for what had happened the previous week. I appreciate the free pedicure but the whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth. Truthfully, I do not feel like a valued client. The salon is nice and generally they do a great job, but I will not be returning.

"I was so excited to get my hair cut & colored because of the great reviews on here. I wish I could be one of the very happy customers, but unfortunately, I am not. Hair cut It was okay. She seemed like she was in a hurry & for the price I should have gone somewhere else. Color The dye that is actually on my hair looks nice, but the dye is also ALL OVER my face, my forehead, my neck... I can understand a bit on my forehead but why are there streaks of dye on my cheek On my EYELID When Felice (the owner) was dying my hair, the dye was flying everywhere. I give two stars, because the place was easy to find & Felice seemed like a nice lady. Also, they offer other services there &I a lot of products. But I will not be going back.Edited to one star, because I found a ton of dye IN my ear. & now I am pissed off. I could have done a better job then she did.

"Went here for eyelash extensions and they were absolutely horrifying. There was so much glue it ruined my own eyelashes. They literally started falling off before I even got home. I looked like a clown. I was hysterical. My husband went back down there and spoke with them eyelashes in hand and they refused to refund the money paid.She would reapply them. I have no lashes to attach them too. DO NOT DO BUSINESS HERE. They don't care about a happy customer they care about the money!

"My nail technician was Susan.  I showed her a picture of exactly what I wanted (short french tips with rounded corners).  She began the process and right off the bat was very rough with the manual and electric buffers, especially on my cuticles.  I have not had a manicure in 12 years so I couldn't remember if they were supposed to trim your cuticles or not or whether the process was supposed to be painful or not, which it most definitely was.  After some research, I now know they should NOT cut your cuticles, because if they nick and cause an open would with their un-sanitized instruments, you could get an infection, and a potentially nasty one at that (think staph, MRSA, etc.).  And she did cut mine open... on the side of two fingers, my middle and thumb, to the point they bled a little.  And apparently you should not see any existing white powder on the buffers they use on you, meaning they have not been cleaned or swapped out after each client.  The buffers she used on me (manual and electric) had a considerable amount of existing white nail powder on them.The charge was $30 and I gave her a $5 tip which I now know I shouldn't have and I really regret.My nails did not turn out looking like the picture I showed Susan.  She applied the tips too far in, making my nail beds look short and stubby.  The rounded corners I asked for turned into rounded SIDES with sharp corners, looking very odd.  And there are visible air bubbles trapped under each nail's polish.I can deal with the way my nails look but the thing I am most upset about are the two cuticles she cut and made bleed.  I washed them really well and used disinfectant on them.  It is now the next day and the wounded areas are puffy and red, so yes, they are infected.  I can only hope and pray it won't be serious and will clear up quickly.  I will be soaking them in Listerine today.  If the infections persist, I will be reporting this salon.I cannot speak for the other technicians who work there, but if you must go there, DO NOT USE SUSAN.

"I got eyelash extensions yesterday.  I have had them for two years from another salon in Chandler but thought I would try this place after a friend recommended it.  I found Holly to be pushy about the pricing at first telling me $100.  She did my eyelashes in 30 minutes and it looked like a 30 min job.  The entire time she did my eyelashes she was fighting with a friend who was standing there next to me accusing her of flirting with an ex of hers....   Can you say ""unprofessional"" .    I am going in to my previous salon as quick as possible to get them removed because they looked like cheap spiders on top of my eyes.

"Horrible lash techDoesn't  know what she was doing. Didn't have me sign a liability waiverWhich as a certified lash technician it is against the law to put chemicals near people's eyes without first signing a liability waiver.  Eyes were puffy and red the next day she added for lashes to a single lash which if you've ever had your lashes done you know that's very painful. I called her and complained she told me to come in the next day that she would give me my money back when I came in the next day she was not there and is now refusing to give me my money back.Do not use her for lashes.

"Denise did my top and bottom eyeliner in July. She never mentioned how dialated my pupils would be, very unsafe to drive. She argued with me very arrogantly when i questioned her use of scented, generic baby wipes to scrub my eyes (open wounds at that point).Next day my eyes were swollen shut, then were red and oozed pus for 3 days! The top liner did not stay AT ALL, it came completely off! When we asked for partial money back or for her to fix in some way, you want talk about rude and unprofessional! She did not show kindness or offer to make it right in any way. I've NEVER seen anything like her in my life.

"I purchased a gift certificate up front from them only to find out that they were never going to let me use it.    I kept calling to try to make appointments and each time I called, the staff was rude and said that they had no appointments.    My gift certificate expired because they never had any appointments available (or so they said) and when I explained my situation to them over the phone, they were extremely rude.    I said that I would tell my friends and family about my awful experience there and about how they took my money but never provided services to me.    The staff said something extremely rude to me over the phone and then hung up.I will never give this salon my money again.     It's a shame that I'm out 50 bucks and have nothing to show for it.

"Okay, so my big beef here is not so much with this LOCATION of Bath and Body Works, but rather with Bath and Body Works as a company in general. Let me explain. For starters, I just want to say that this store is clean, well-presented and has some very nice girls working in it. The scents of candles and lotions are incredible, and they were hard to resist with their Fall displays front and center with names like ""Autumn Leaves"" and ""Cinnamon Pumpkin"". Their prices are reasonable and their gift items are very nice. (Sigh)...so here's why I'll never shop here again. I came in to check out the store and in my browsing around, grabbed a tester for a particular scent and gave it a try. I always like to do this with lotions and perfumes; before I commit to purchasing, I put it on and walk around with it for a few hours to let it soak in since it always smells different than when you first put it on. So I left the store and for the next hour could not stop smelling my hands - it was so good it was intoxicating. I don't even remember which scent it was, but that's not important anyway. An hour and a half later I was back in the store and heading for the counter, bottle in hand. So I'm reading the back. I'm trying to be ever so conscious about my purchases, especially beauty products, in that I only buy products that are paraben-free and NOT tested on animals. Call me uptight, but I just don't think animals should be tortured so I can smell like fake juniper. I scan the label and see that it does contain parabens, but it smells so friggin good I make an exception. Then I see it: ""This finished product not tested on animals."" And for a minute I think, Great! Ready to buy. And then...this...""finished"" product  What the heck does that mean Normally if a product is not tested on animals it will just say ""Not tested on animals"", or ""We NEVER test our products on animals"", or the like. And if it says nothing, you always assume that they do test on animals. But ""This FINISHED product"" So, the final product that fills the bottle in my hand, the one that I intend to use, has not been tested on any animal. But what about everything before that And then I just got mad. Very mad. Do they think we are idiots Some big shot at BBW must believe that their customers are totally mindless, lazy, and can be easily fooled by the wording they chose. I don't know what made me more mad; the fact that they do test on animals, or the fact that they take us all for idiots and try to play like they don't run the tests. Either way, out of principle, I put the bottle back and decided I will never again give a dime of my money to BBW. Excuse the rant, but this just really pissed me off.

"Walgreens has become a travesty of retail. During my most recent visit for a pack of gum and a bottle of water, I waited in line for nearly 10-minutes and watched two cashiers swap registers no fewer than 4 times, and I have no idea why. The gentleman with his wife in front of me said, ""This is the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen at a store, ever."" And I couldn't have agreed more.When it came time for me to check-out, my total came to $3.16, and I was asked if I was a member of their rewards club, followed by ""why not"" followed by, ""why not join it's free!"" When I declined, and opted to pay in cash, the guy took my $4 and then didn't give me any change. He wished me ""well"" and when I asked for my change, he looked at me like I was crazy... I reminded him that I paid $4 for a $3.16 item. He then said, ""Oh, did you want your change""Ugh.

"An anti-hybrid of fogies stuck in their ways of business and young kids that don't give a shit. As soon as you walk in to the store, you are bombarded with stink. That stench comes from the overbearing sprayers that take guerrilla tactics and stink bomb you from counter angles. You have no clue what wretched stank is coming from where. After you run (jog, hell no), from Smell Factor, you are greeted with overpriced products. Everywhere you turn, there have brands that have not been promoted since the 80's at like $70+ for a shirt. Insane. I wonder why they have had financial issues for decades.The service is so annoying. You can tell they are told to rush customers. Those that are older take it to heart and do so with parody-worthy vigor. The younger clerks are indifferent; you could read the ""don't bother me and let me text my bff because they pay me minimum wage anyway"" expression.

"April 2012 I entered Boston Store in East Town Mall in Madison Wisconsin. I was in the store for about an hour and a half. I decided to try on some dresses & skirts. I went into a dressing room to change. I went to the room furthest from the dressing entry way. While changing my clothes I heard a mans voice.I frantically search for a way to lock the door, but there is not lock! The door flies open! There is a man standing there looking me up & down, smiling at me! I was trying on dresses so I was completely undressed. I went into shock, screaming you can be in here!! I slammed the door ( which flew back open, no lock or latch) I put a chair in front of it and frantically I got dressed. I came out of the dressing room yelling ""there is a man in the dressing room""!The clerks told him he shouldn't be in there, but weren't that concerned about what just happened to me! The only person who seem to care was a customer, she appeared to be shocked about the situation I left the store in tears.The next day I called the manager. She didn't think it was a big deal! I said ""why don't you have locks on the dressing room doors You could have prevented this horrible situation!"" She had no response to my question. She said she would send me a $50.00 gift card, but I received no apology, how insulting!Come to find out not a single dressing room in Boston Store East Town, not even lingerie dept has a lock on the door. I believe this is every woman's worst nightmare!Aren't we supposed to feel safe in a store while in a state of undress I wish it had not happened to me, but it did. I would like to bring awareness to other women. I will always make sure the dressing room has a lock before I enter and undress.I spoke with store manager several times. I let her know I spend thousand of dollars every year at Boston Store. She didn't seem to care. I asked to speak with upper management, she will not give phone number I gave her mine. To date no one has called.I feel I was stalked at Boston Store that day. He may have known there were no locks and followed me into dressing room. I feel lucky I was no raped!I want other women to hear my story and be sure to check dressing rooms for locks. I also want people to hear about the complete lack of compassion empathy I received from the store manager who represents this this company.

The lady stared at me with surprise, like I interrupted her thoughts about tonight's meatloaf dinner. After a few seconds, she replied in a muffled grunt, ""uh....hi"".

"I have a gift certificate for an Ultimate Makeover - 2 12 hours of consultation, cut, color, style and makeup.  I was really excited to try the Spa and in desperate need of a haircut so I called right away to make an appointment. I was lucky enough that the first available appointment, although 2 weeks away was on a Friday night.  I booked the appointment and made big plans to go out with friends to debut my new look (really, how often do you get to have your makeup professionally done for a night out.) Flash forward to an hour before my much anticipated appointment I received a voicemail message informing me that Mallory was running behind with another appointment and I would need to call to reschedule mine.  WTF You're cancelling my appointment and not even apologizing or offering me any option like a shorter serviceI swallow my anger and return the call think that perhaps since they canceled my appointment, they would find a way to quickly accommodate me with a new appointment or perhaps upgrade me for the inconvenience.  Nope.  I was informed that Mallory's next time slot was a week and a half out or I could see someone else on a Tuesday - Who needs their makeup done for a Tuesday nightHonestly if it wasn't a gift certificate I would just cancel and go somewhere else. This is NOT a great first impression.To be fair, I would like to add that their phone staff have always been delightful. So that and the limitations of yelp are the only reason they get a star.  I will update after I have my service, hopefully they are worth the inconvenience and irritation.

TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY THREE (that's $273.00) later, I came home with products I just HAD-TO-HAVE pushed on me like drug dealers by everyone from the stylist, the shampoo girl, the facial girl, the counter girls, who just wouldn't take ""NO"" for an answer and are very well-trained to ""put you on the spot"" in front of other customers so as to embarrass you, and ""trick"" you into buying something you really don't need just to boost their commission sales. Jennifer hasn't the foggiest notion how to properly complete a man's haircut. She neglected to trim the sideburns, ear, nose, eyebrow, and neck hair, even though I asked her, to which she responded, ""We have people who do that!"" (for an extra charge!) and suggested I spend more money to have another girl wax these areas. WTF Are you kidding me here REALLY On the lighter note, I am getting a so-called complimentary facial. Definitely a place where you should prepare yourself to be accosted by staff to spend more money!

"I now understand where the name comes from. Yesterday I went into Dick's to buy my daughter some shirts. As we were checking out I noticed a bin that was full of bags that had sports watches and body bands to monitor vital signs. I started going through them to find a watch that would meet my workout needs. Most of the bags that contained these watches were missing something. Not a problem because the outside clearly noted what was wrong with the package. It said things like "" missing manual or dead battery"" I found a watch that was missing a manual. I went online and looked up the watch and it had what i was looking for. I purchased the watch as is and took it home. After trying to sync the watch to the body strap monitor for an hour, I went online and found that the watch that i have takes an analog strap and the one that was in this bag was digital. I went back to the store today to swap out the wrong band for the correct on. I was told that i had to speak to Nicole the store manager. I was directed to Nicole who was assisting another customer. After standing patiently waiting for Nicole while the customer and Nicole discussed trading in his older wife for two younger ones, I got annoyed. I went back to the counter to find a different manager. I was told that Nicole is it. I waited some more. After waiting for Nicole for 15 minutes and listening to conversation that had nothing to do with products or services she asked how she could help me. I explained the situation and showed her the online picture of what i was supposed to receive with my purchase and she told me that they take everything out of the original package and put them into the bags that they sell these in.   i pointed out that as people look through the bag,   watches are being mixed up. I showed her Timex watches with Polar band and bags with two watches and no bands. Some watches had no bags at all and were sitting in the bottom of the bin with other loose manuals and straps. After going through each bag, I could not find the correct band. Someone is walking around with a digital watch with an analog band. I asked if i could purchase a more expensive watch and just pay the difference. Nicole said no. I get ""as is"" but I purchased it because the issue that was advertised on the packaging was it was missing the manual. It did not say that the accessories in the packaging do not match and the watch can not be used for anything except time and date.Now I have to pay for a new band as well as pay for shipping which is going to be more expensive than buying the watch at the original retail price. Thank you for horrible customer service and a useless watch.Pissed of Morrison Family YMCA Soccer Dad

"I've been to several Dick's sporting good stores and this one is by far one of the worst. A few years ago I took my mountain bike to them for a basic service. Upon picking it up I realized that my high end pedals had been switched with some of the ones they use on their floor. I brought this up to the staff's attention who didn't hesitate in saying that I was wrong and they don't do that. I asked to speak to the manager an nobody was there from the management staff. I asked them to go review their security footage and they said they didn't want to do that either. I took this issue up their corporate ladder and all they did was apologized.I since stopped frequenting them. Sadly due to lack of options from a similar retailer in the areaI had to visit this location again recently, I had a backpack on as I rode there in my motorcycle. I walked in the store and started headed to the department I was needing, I was stopped by a rather unpleasant employee who told me I could not be in the store with a backpack due to recent theft issues. I told her that I had been in other dick's sporting goods and was never made aware of such rule. I also informed her that there was no signage stating that as I walked in the store. She continued to state that I could either give them my backpack or I could leave the store!!!!I told her that neither option worked and that she could inform her security staff to watch me on camera or have someone follow me around as I did not feel comfortable giving them my backpack which had my valuables in it.This brand has high prices and the staff isn't very knowledgeable nor very pleasant. They are definitely missing the point of retail on so many levels it's pathetic.I wish there were other options of stores similar to them in the area.

I did not eat here because upon arrival, the host (who wasn't at the stand when we came in, but had to wait several minutes for him to appear) just walked up and said flatly, ""There's no room here. We're full.""  My mother, sister and I (all well dressed and very presentable) stared at him in shock at his rudeness, and he said, ""We have trivia tonight and there's a soccer game.""  The place was indeed very full, and we had come hoping to play the trivia (and were about 20 minutes early for trivia), but there are better ways to handle this, such as merely being nice to potential customers.  Needless to say, this was a total turnoff to ever try coming back to this place.

My actual rating is no stars since we did not do anything but walk in and out. We were so disappointed that the 17%  of smokers were considered more important than the other 83% of non-smokers.

"The bartenders are friendly and the drink selection is creative, such as the Long Island Mr. Iced T.  How cool is that!But this place is a hellhole for people who really like to dance without getting blind wasted.  There is no designated dance area and the place is fairly large, so you end up with a bunch of people milling about, beers in hand.   I have never seen so many people so slovenly drunk bumping into you or spilling their drink on you.  It's like dancing in a barn with all the animals running loose.   It's probably the gothiest place in town and I really wanted to like it place but all three times I've been I spent more effort trying to control my violent tendencies than having fun dancing.And the DJ is overkill.  Three screens show movies and videos which is fine.  But it gets really annoying with the DJ calling out the names of every band and song. Perhaps he thinks you were too drunk to remember or too young to have lived it.  We all know these songs by heart, it's totally cliche and they're not teaching us anything new.  The DJ just likes being the center of attention which provides an abhorrent atmosphere.  They also completely mash songs together, sometimes running over the best parts of the end or even the middle of a song with the beginning of another.  They do not watch the dance floor which is DJ Lesson 1.  If a good thing is already happening on the dance floor, don't mess it up.  I heard three crashes in a row on the dance floor one night and the entire crowd just stops moving.  It makes it a memorable night.  But not in a good way.PS: Whatever happened to the ""no bottles or glassware on the dance floor"" rule  I guess they only enforce that at ""classy"" establishments.

"Granted I haven't been in since my ""experience"" I really don't have a desire to go back.The night my friend and I decided to give it a whirl.. well, we drove up and the parking lot was full of Cadillacs and Buicks. Should have been a sign but we pulled up in the van and parked. There was a very large, foreboding looking guy hanging out at the front door. Hmmm.. We walked up and he looked at us like, what are these two white girls doing here We were wondering why until we stepped inside and every african american person in the building (which was all of them), swung around to look at us. It was, seriously, just like the old Westerns where the cowboy walks into the saloon and all of the crooks and criminals look up with daggers in their eyes. We stood there, for a hot second, a guy started hitting on my friend so I pulled on her shirt sleeve and we literally backed out of there.I could feel people staring at the backs of our heads as we left.Hmm.. maybe we were there on the wrong night.**For the record, because I'm sure someone will get offended... I am in no way racist and I would have LOVED to stay and party with everyone. The only reason we left was because we felt entirely, completely unwelcome.

"AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THEY SERVE SALMONELLA!!!Our dining experience at this restaurant was the worst I can remember!  We sat for over :15 minutes with no waiter and only after we went to the hostess did the waiter show up.I ordered what the waiter claimed was their ""signature"" dish, Paella Latorre.  It was served with ice cold mussels and the entire dish was less than warm.  I called over the waiter and explained.  :15 minutes later he returned with the dish and claimed the chef had ""re-heated"" it.  While the plate was hot the food was still tepid.  I called the waiter over again and told him.  He argued that he ""saw"" the chef reheat the food.  By this time, my business associate had almost completed his meal so I ate as much as I could and left about 13.We told the waiter that we expected the restaurant to do something about the check.  He returned with the credit card receipt and said there was nothing he could do.  We called the manager to the table and he refused to see our point and said there was nothing he WOULD do.The following week I contacted Blerim Meta, the General Manager of this restaurant as well as ""Aquavina"".  He has also refused to do anything and also refused to apologize for the terrible experience.AVOID THIS RESTAURANT!!  AVOID AQUAVINA!!

"Hey C-Street. I was really looking forward to hearing Alexander spin some spooky music last night. I was there for a number of hours during his posted set times and heard nothing that I wouldn't expect to hear on top 40 radio. Alex kept saying he hoped to get back on the decks but it didn't happen while I was there.I paid money to enter last night for one reason only, I wanted to hear the music I enjoy. I bought numerous drinks to support the bar, I even bought some jello shots despite my better judgement. I know how this is supposed to work! I spent years working at gothindustrial clubs in the Bay Area, a friend runs the longest continually operating gothindustrial club in the United States, our community used to have a vibrant scene in town and I think it could again but not if venues bump 'our' night for frat parties and pull stunts like last night's.

"My female best friend and I were in town for the night, road-tripping.It seemed like a nice place inside - totally empty, but it was late and a weeknight, so I didn't think much of it. I didn't have much of a problem with drinks, or service until later that night... and that's why I'm taking the time to give this place a 1-star review.This is a review about a certain bartender, whose name my friend and I never got, but he said he was Chinese and Colombian. The area seems to close down early.... even though there seemed to be a basketball game getting out. The bartender said he was closing up early, directed us to another bar (closed when we got there) hand we found a place nearby. Shortly after, the same bartender showed up at the bar, started drinking with us. I don't remember much about the conversation, except for some lies this guy was telling us, saying that he was running the bar after two weeks of working there, that he didn't live in Phoenix, he lived in New York - later, he forgot that he said that, and told us he lived in the same city in California that we did. By the time the bar closed, I was getting pretty sloshed, and he proceeded to invite himself to our motel room (I thought my friend invited him, and my friend thought I did), and by the time we got to my friend's car, he insisted I sit in the back seat. I'll skip some details here, and make a long story short:I puked on the ride home, so I spent the rest of the night sobering up. The ChineseColombian guy kept pushing weed and beer on my friend (who's a lesbian, by the way) and when you're a man, you can tell when a guy is being a sleazeball and trying to get into a girl's pants. It became blatantly obvious that he was waiting for me to pass out so he could do what he wanted, and so I forced myself to stay awake. Again, I'm skipping on a lot of detail here, because Yelp really isn't the place for that.After he had long overstayed his welcome (which was never offered in the first place), my friend went to the bathroom, and I mustered all the civility I had left to ask him to leave as nicely and non-offensively as possible. To this, he insisted that unless I reimbursed him for the pot and beer he brought (neither of which I personally imbibed) he didn't have to leave. I bit my tongue.Shortly after, I could hear him talking about me outside when he and my friend were having a cigarette. I snapped, had to get rude with him, pulled my friend inside and slammed the door in his face. The point of this whole review is this:Ladies, watch out for this sleazeball bartender. He'll try to get into your pants by the most disrespectable means.

"The staff was so RUDE! 1st door guy said we could come in for free anytime Fri night. We came back about 20 min later. Different door guy and some old ladies who would not let us in, said we had to each pay $10. The place was ghetto and empty. We went back to Bar Smith (next door) who had much nicer staff, no cover, great drinks & drink prices, and awesome music. Sorry Sky Lounge, you suck.

"Two words: Overpriced and understaffed.I'm not sure if Palazzo is always open ""sometimes"" or just recently reopened, but they've brought back the goth night one Friday a month. Just to clarify-not reviewing that particular dance night, just the establishment itself. Every time I have been, the bar has been understaffed. Two for an entire nightclub that is packed How does that work It takes forever to get a drink and then it's just generally expensive no matter what you get. There's also a back bar that seems to never be in use. With the amount of people that hang out back there for the majority of the night, you'd think they'd hire a few extra people. Also Maybe invest in some misters for your back bar-it gets ridiculously hot back there when it's packed full of people. It's almost as if this is a bare bones establishment. It's sad because this event is attempting to revive the goth scene yet the venue that it's at (which used to be Tranzylvania back in the day) just plain sucks.

"Place is awesome, Bartenders real nice. DJ's suck. We have patronized all the goth  bars in town for years and DJ's are getting so bad with music. I used to love this place, now I don't think we will ever go back.... shame too, because all other barsclubs are closed down. We need a better scene and better DJ's!

"This place charges a cover charge! We should be paid to come in there! It's in a horrible place in town, drinks or retardedly over priced & the parking is ridiculous. The inside of the club only smells more worse then the urinal because the little tiny room they call a bathroom is 2x2! You can't pay me to come back there. I wish I had known how horrible this place was before I got suckered into going & basically throwing away my money.

"By far the worst gay nightclub in phoenix and trust me I know gay nightclubs!!! Lol no seriously this place is crap I have been suckered to come here a few times for a birthday party and some other events and it's no fun the drag show is lame or the acts I have seen are the Dj is good plays some different tunes the ac is non existent I think they use a swamp cooler. The bathroom is the size of a toilet stall and always packed that u have to piss in the alley where there is plenty of hookers at your disposal. The drinks are expensive, watered down and even the soda tasted funny the bar tender was very nice and friendly. Never tried the food outside but I hear it's great, the parking is another disaster there is limited space and the night we went there was a few break ins in the back parking lot near liquor store. Just being honest but the bad outweighs the good at this club, give it a shot at your own risk but remember I warned you.

"Very very odd place. Will not be returning, extremely loud, forget having a conversation with anyone. We were by the front door and this stage on the other end of the bar, and still couldn't hear each other. Def a dive bar. Mostly men, keep a close eye on your wife or girlfriend. They'll be snatched if you're not careful. Lots of HOG members and other motorcycle clubs present. This crowd makes me somewhat nervous, and my husband is a 250lb biker.

"I went to the Sunday night Salsa lessons at Paragon. There were about 200 people for the salsa group lessons. It was a noisy zoo. Men far outnumbered women, but during the course of the lesson it almost evened out. Lot's of partner switching -- in fact switching is almost all we did. That has it's advantages if your main goal is to hold hands with lots of partners. I have certainly heard a lot of hype about Paragon but the studio left me kind of cold. I don't see how anybody could learn to dance there. The quality of instruction isn't close to other local studios I have been to. Of course maybe the instruction was better than I knew since it was almost impossible to see or hear the instructor and individual attention is out of the question. I gave them another try on a Thursday for a West Coast Swing lesson. The quality of instruction wasn't good, and we had distractions because other group lessons and privates were given in the same ballroom. They have other small ballrooms so there was little excuse to cram everybody into the main ballroom. I watched a private lesson and wasn't impressed by what I saw. Paragon is probably popular because of the dances after the lessons but the music wasn't for beginners. So, if you want to learn dancing go somewhere else, for meat markets do Paragon. Their prices and quality will appeal to anyone who thinks McDonald's is a great deal.

"Before today I probably would have given this place three stars based mostly on their beer selection; however, today the service was terrible. We waited two hours for a pizza sub, French onion soup, fries, and buffalo chicken tenders. About an hour and a half in we finally got the small pizza sub and the wrongly made buffalo chicken tenders (ie, no hot sauce). We were told by the waitress that she realized it was wrong, but decided to still bring it out to see if my gf would eat it. She sent it back. By a half hour later, we still had not received the buffalo chicken tenders, nor the French onion soup (which should have been mostly made already), and no fries.  We were told the chef was new, but no effort was made really to make the situation better. No quick and easy app or beers on the house. To boot, the beer was pretty expensive. I will probably give the place another chance based on their beer selection, but it won't be for a while. The food has always been average at best, and the pizza sub was no different. We ended up leaving after two hours without receiving 75% of our order.

"The words ""epic fail"" get thrown around a lot these days....but I really feel like they apply in this situation.We went on Friday, April 2 and arrived at 5:10pm.  It was busy, but not crowded....no waiting for a table.  Half price apps and drinks -- we ordered at 5:20.The food (just appetizers, mind you...) didn't arrive till almost 6pm.  Drinks were ordered and were unbelievably slow.  We placed one order for 6 draft beers at 6:15...they arrived at 6:52.  *37 minutes for beer.*By 7:00, we were canceling food orders which we'd given up on after waiting almost an hour.  We just wanted to leave.Instead of comping anything, they added 18% gratuity to each of our bills.  Uhhhh yeah.  Thanks for giving me one more reason never to come back.   We finally were able to leave around 7:30.Bar Louie:  You are dead to me.

"We were going to see a movie that started at 9:40pm. The 2 of us got to Bar Louie at 8:30.  We sat outside, and it was nearly 30 minutes before the waiter even stopped to get our order.  I tried stopping a waitress but was told 'this isn't my table'.  Finally the waiter took our order.  1 Sam Adams light bottle, and one Pineapple Juice+Vodka.  After about 15minutes another waiter (maybe the manager I don't know) asked if we had been waited on. We said yes, and told him we had been waiting.  He left, and another (different) waitress came to bring us our drinks.. they were wrong.. My date was given vodka on the rocks. and I was given a Sam Adams.. They took these back, and another 10 minutes before the correct order was served.. We told them to bring another round and the check.  It was 20 minutes before they returned.. and they forgot the check.By this time we had to go to be on time for the movie.. my date asked for the check again so we could leave.. finally they brought it and I gave him my card, when he came back we signed it and left in a hurry to catch the movie.for 2 bottle beers, and 2 pineapple juice + vodka I was charged $31.03. I didn't have time to complain or ask. I won't be going back.

"When the ratio to wait staff to diners is 3:1 you'd think you could get service!!!Nothing erks me more then seeing idol wait staff and hungry patrons. I very rarely walk out of a restaurant with out having eaten first. I came here on Saturday ay 6pm. Almost none of the diners had food on their table and many of them didn't have drinks in the 15 minutes I was there I counted 9 waitress again I counted 9 waitresses and not a one of them came over to our table to get even a drink order. Just from the looks of it I could tell staying any longer would be a total train wreck. So after 15 minutes of waitress counting we left with empty bellies.

"I was looking to get out of the apartment on a really nice, sunny day and we decided to drive to Waterfront and walk around. All around great day until we hit Bar Louie for some drinks and appetizers.I am giving it one star, though it deserves none, because our waitress was nice, if a bit inattentive, and the hummus app we ordered was pretty damn good. Outside of that Bar Louie leaves a lot to be desired.This is probably the first place I've been to where they charge $10 and up for all mixed drinks. To me, that is beyond ridiculous. Bar Louie is not an upscale restaurant, as much as they wish they were, and paying almost $60 for three drinks and two appetizers is insanity defined. As I mentioned the waitress was friendly, but she definitely did not come back and check on us enough. I really wanted to like this place because of things I had heard and the drinks we had were really damn good, but if it want to spend that kind of money, I'll go somewhere that I can get good service.

"I came here last night to get a few appetizers before a movie, and was hoping to be able to write a review on the food. Unfortunately, I cannot because the service was so bad that I left before I had the chance to order. We found seats at the bar behind the taps. After sitting there for 5 minutes and not being acknowledged, we thought that they might not be able to see us, and so we moved to a different pair of seats in the middle of the bar, grabbing a few menus on the way so we would be ready to order. It was fairly busy, but it is not like there were people standing at the bar trying to get drinks - everyone was seated and I'm sure they face much busier times. We sat in our new seats for almost 15 minutes (I timed it - I am not exaggerating), and were not even acknowledged. You would at least think the bartender would acknowledge us and tell us he would be with us when he could, but despite staring him down almost the whole time, we could not even make eye contact. I hope this is a fluke but will probably not be back to find out.

"Meh, I just don't see the appeal Bar Louis has to Pittsburghers. I guess this particular restaurant benefits from people who work at the Waterfront stopping in after a shift. It's always packed. Being so close to the AMC theater, they get traffic before and after movies. It's expensive, the food is so so. Before I get ahead of myself, I had the BBQ ranch chicken salad without chicken. The BBQ ranch dressing was very good, but it's very easy to duplicate at home. It's equal parts ranch dressing and KC Masterpiece hickory BBQ sauce and a drop or two of Worcestershire and a drop of franks hot sauce. Tuesday is dollar burgers 5 until midnight, daily drink and happy hour selections, but even that's not enough to get me here. Skip it. One caveat for this location, free parking. At Station Square's location you gotta pay to park the jalopy.I'm eager to see if this place sees a huge drop in business when Burgatory opens across the street.

"We stopped here to enjoy a drink before our movie. Our server, was friendly. My husband had a margarita and my server suggested a berry mojito to me.Both drinks were overly sweet and barely any alcohol.  After I finished my drink, I used my fork to dig for the blackberries at the bottom only to find (to my disgust), a decent sized piece of clear saran wrap! Ugg! Did they muddle the mint into the saran wrap!!! She comped the drink but we won't be back.Can't speak about the food since we didn't have any but atmosphere was loud and it was difficult to have a conversation without repeating yourself.

"I can't even review this place. We sat ourselves and waited for a waitress to take our order, and we waited and waited until we got tired and just left. And I have to be clear it was a Saturday afternoon, maybe like 10 tables with people at them and I saw 3 waitress walking around. I think it's probably a bad idea to ignore people that come into your restaurant, especially since burgatory just opened across the street.

"We had the worst possible experience at the Eat N Park at Waterfront on 21210 at around 10pm. Our waitress (Annemarie) was inattentive and got us the wrong order. We ended up with a dish we had not even ordered and still got charged for it on the check. One of my friends ordered a Buffalo Chicken Sandwich, which according to the menu description, should've had lettuce and tomato in it. But the sandwich that arrived on our table had none of those ingredients. When pointed out to the waitress, she just brought some lettuce and tomatoes in a plate! How crude! Spoke to the manager after paying the full check and first of all, she did not even offer to re-imburse for the item we did not even order, and that had been forcibly thrust upon us. When I asked the manager about the Buffalo Chicken sandwich not having any lettuce and tomato, she said they just got new menus and that description is not correct and that Buffalo Chicken Sandwich is supposed to be without lettuce and tomato! What a lame excuse! Even your online menu says under the description for a Buffalo Chicken sandwich that its supposed to have both those ingredients - ""Served with lettuce and tomato on a fresh-baked Kaiser roll."" - That's what the last line in the description of Buffalo Chicken Sandwich says. Shame on you Manager for lying! Instead of admitting her fault, she was blaming it to a new menu!Not only did we have to pay for something that we didn't order or eat, but we got sub-standard food that was different from what was described in the menu, and had to deal with a really bad waitress and insensitive and deceitful manager to top off the whole experience. I am never going to come back to any Eat N Park location ever again, and will never recommend one to any of my friends either. What a waste of time and money! Plus dealing with callous and lying people - my goodness, I surely had my patience tested this evening!

I hope the owner or general manager reads this. And think the health department should too.Service is mediocre and slow. consistently. Waitress was ok in attitude.After our soup starter (good french onion soup) we waited and waited and waited and waited for our mains. Noticing us staring at her, waitress stopped by, went into kitchen, came back and said we were next. my watch said 8:31. Then her manager came by and argued with me and said we were next, then at 8:52pm the horrible food finally arrived. That's 21 minutes to be next. In that time we watched 4 tables turn from being seated to drinks to mains to check down while we waited for our main. Manager embarrassed himself. Said they were busy and working our food and he had checked and would come soon. I told him about the 4 tables turning and he said no they didn't. then I said I used to manage restaurants and know what customer service and ticket times are and he challenged me and said no I didn;t and I had no idea what I was talking about. What an idiot! First rule of restaurant business is the customer is always right.Then the food arrived. How hard is it to do chicken marsala with mushrooms, seriously It was two soggy fried chicken tenders from the deep fryer (not pan sauteed) over a bowl of bowtie pasta with shrooms and a sauce. While the sauce did have some marsala in it, it was full of sour cream and tasted like stroganoff and a little funny. The Penne ala vodka was sauteed canned tomatoes and no flavor. We were so hungry we ate most and left.1 hour later I was sick on the side of the road from the dinner and still feel really rough this morning.

"My husband and I are Cubs fans and flew into Pittsburgh to see Friday and Saturday's Cubs-Pirates game this past weekend (77 & 8).  We got to PNC Park around 5 p.m. and since the gates weren't open we decided to sit and have some drinks before the game.  We stopped first at Atria's.  Although there was only one other table occupied outside, we were told if we weren't going to order food (just drink) we would have to give up our table if people, who were eating food needed it.  This was RIDICULOUS  to us so we left!  We were paying guests just like their other guests!!  Anyway we went a few businesses down and drank at Dominic's.  We went to Dominic's both nights and probably spent close to $100 AND did up getting FOOD.  Atria's better rethink how they treat guests....

They're terrible for pick-up too - even when you call way ahead, you're made to wait, and they're surly about taking care of you when you arrive for your food.

"I came here on the Fourth of July after getting off of work. My friend and I stopped for one drink before the fireworks. Let's just say I will never return. I stood there for a good 15 minutes with maybe 5 people tops at the bar. The bartenders never once acknowledged me yet they did manage to make eye contact. They then all walked out from behind the bar and went outside. It took another ten minutes until finally the manager came over and served me. I am a bartender and I am appalled to see such people being employed at what seems like a decent place. I am a phenomenal tipper being that I am in the industry and sadly I didn't leave a single dollar. Hopefully they can learn from their mistakes instead of probably losing more potential customers.

"After eating lunch several days a week at Atrias PNC Park restaurant for many years, I have finally decided that the price has just lost any relation to portionsquality and will not be dining there anytime in the near future.Gradually, over the past year, the prices have continued to increase to the point of being dinner menu prices for lunch size meals.  Recently, the portion size has significantly diminished, to the point of being almost comical today.The fish ""special"" today was BBQ salmon with asparagus.  It consisted of about 3oz of salmon and four spears of asparagus.  It actually looked ridiculous on the plate.  The specials used to have 5-6 oz of fish, included a decent portion of vegetables, and rice, all for a dollar or two less.  While a bit more than I wanted to spend for lunch, at least the quality and size of portion made some sense.  Today, I spent $15 plus tax and tip and left feeling like I had eaten an appetizer and still hungry.They have pushed it too far, I am no longer willing to waste my money at Atria's.  Too bad, we used to really enjoy lunch there.

"When you walk into a buzzing restaurant, you'd expect to be greeted by someone, be that a server, a greeter or the bartender. I went in last night, stood around for almost 10 minutes, and was completely ignored. I was meeting a few friends, so I decided to walk across the street and grab a beer and make a reservation (using open table) for 45 minutes later.  Reservation confirmed, and beer finished, I walk back over, walk in to the place and someone's at the computer in the entryway on the phone. He finishes, we make eye contact, he nods and walks away. My friends come in, we wait 10 minutes for someone who works there to talk to us. I tell her we have reservations, she acts like it can't happen, and that it's my mistake, she says that the place is closed for a private party. I ask why there isn't a sign on the door saying 'closed for private party', and I get a ridiculous answer that the ""CEO doesn't like us to do that"". How dumb is that: you leave your system open to make reservations and you don't alert people that might be going to a show on the north shore that the place is closed. The fake sincerity is what really got me. You know what a 'private party' sign does It advertises that you are available for private parties, and would have given me an hour to figure out other arrangements.

I know this one is long winded, but you should be forewarned about giving them your money!I have been to your bar many times, and I have had both good and less than average experiences, but this past Saturday was terrible! My girlfriend and I came to have some dinner around 9 pm. We knew it would be crowded due to the Penguin game, and that wasn't a problem. When we arrived, there were no seats at the bar or tables available anywhere. We decided to have a beer and wait. After the game was over, some tables opened up so we sat in an empty booth in the back and waited. After about 5 minutes, a waitress came over, cleaned our table, and made notice of the fact that we still had drinks. Sadly, this was the last time that she ever came to our table. We placed our closed menus at the end of the table...nothing, we put our empty glasses at the end of the table with the menus...nothing. We sat and waited for more than 15 minutes. All the while we were waiting, another group of four sat the table next to us, they were never given any attention. They got up and left after being completely ignored. I understand that the restaurant was busy, and that service and wait times may be impacted, but the way we were treated (or lack of being treated) was appalling. It was especially annoying to watch the server that initially cleaned our table giggling and carrying on with two other booths that appeared to be friends with her on the other side of the dining room and then when she was done she just casually walked over to another empty table picked up something off of it and went into the kitchen without even taking a look around the dining room. At this point we were disgusted and got up and left, I was annoyed and made mention of how awful the service in the back was to the doorman. The waitresses in the back were terrible and seemed to have no sense of urgency or seem to care about most of the customers, with the exception of the few tables that they were more interested in socializing with. This seems to be a problem, because on some of my past less than stellar experiences, the disappointment was again with the service from the back servers. On those occasions it was the same thing, they seemed to be more interested in being social butterflies than providing any sort of service. You don't need to improve your wait staff, you need to replace some of them, at least the people working the back dining room on this past Saturday, they were completely useless! Will I come back to your restaurant, I'm not sure. The food is good, but I work hard for my money, and I expect to receive more than good food in exchange for it. Sincerely, Matt K.Here is the response that I gotPlease give me a call (412)555-1212 to discuss the matter. I'm sorry & will make every attempt to make sure this doesn't happen again.Thank you for making me aware of the situation.Joey DeMarco I promptly called him as soon as I got this email. It went to voice mail , so I left a message. That was it, the guy didn't even have the decency to return my phone call. It is amazing that this is how business owners expect to keep people coming through their doors and handing over their hard earned money. Support local businesses, but make sure they are deserving of your money!

"The place looks like something from the Godfather - old school 1970 dark and gloomy wood paneling. Complete with crap brown pleather chairs and fake wood tables. The food was cooked well, but lackluster. I got veal picata which mostly had the flavor of flour and beef broth. On the plus, the staff was very nice and very attentive. Management - you really need to update the place.

"My food was plain and boring. Our service was sub-par; we asked for water when we first got there and it didn't show up until shortly before we got our check. The dumb ass waitress spilled water on the floor by our table but didn't bother cleaning it up so when one of the older ladies that was joining me got up she slipped and fell. The manager on duty did apologize, but that was it. There was no offer of a comp or anything and she basically turned around and went on about her business despite us pointing out to her that there was water on the floor that caused the fall. Fortunately no one was seriously injured, but I really don't think that the staff handled the situation with any sort of intelligence or empathy. The place was noisy and it was pricey.

"I'm staying at the hotel at which the soho is located and I thought it would be a convenient place to eat dinner. Well, it was overpriced and the food was terrible. I ordered the chicken parm pasta and got it to go to my room. The pasta looked and tasted like it was days old and soggy, the chicken was overdone (dry), and the tiny (super tiny) roll was dry and stale. Very bad food and overpriced. Not only was the food a huge disappointment but the bartender who took my order was unfriendly and not helpful. She then began to pour beer from the tap into a glass and sprayed beer on me and didn't say a word, though I met eye contact with her as soon as it happened. She was more interested in talking with the other waitresses.......you know she got a great tip :)Try another place for food even if you have to step outside of the hotel, there are a bunch of places to eat across the street and at the baseball stadium that is right next to the hotel....Atrias was pretty good and very nice wait staff. http:www.atrias.com

"I wish i could give this place no stars! we sat for lunch after a lunch rush there were 2 other table in the restaurant besides ours, we ordered a blt with chili and a cesar salad....1 hour latler a stale BLT and chili that looked like it had been sitting there for 2 hours comes out. I was still waiting for my cesar salad. The chili was cold and the blt bread was so hard you couldnt bite into it. When we asked to speak to the manager the waitress got very defensive... the manager came over and explained that is their food and how its made so he wasnt sure of the problem. After an argument going back and forth ensued he agreed to comp the meals. Here is the kicker haha...we were going to leave the waitress a tip because clearly it was not her fault however, she came over and asked if our problem was resolved we said yes and then she rolled her eyes and walked away. No tip for you my friend. This is not how you do business especially when there are other options BESIDES SOHO to choose from for lunch.

After waiting 10 minutes to have a bartender at a less than half full bar acknowledge us we then ordered and the drinks arrived.

"We had the worst possible experience at the Eat N Park at Waterfront on 21210 at around 10pm. Our waitress (Annemarie) was inattentive and got us the wrong order. We ended up with a dish we had not even ordered and still got charged for it on the check. One of my friends ordered a Buffalo Chicken Sandwich, which according to the menu description, should've had lettuce and tomato in it. But the sandwich that arrived on our table had none of those ingredients. When pointed out to the waitress, she just brought some lettuce and tomatoes in a plate! How crude! Spoke to the manager after paying the full check and first of all, she did not even offer to re-imburse for the item we did not even order, and that had been forcibly thrust upon us. When I asked the manager about the Buffalo Chicken sandwich not having any lettuce and tomato, she said they just got new menus and that description is not correct and that Buffalo Chicken Sandwich is supposed to be without lettuce and tomato! What a lame excuse! Even your online menu says under the description for a Buffalo Chicken sandwich that its supposed to have both those ingredients - ""Served with lettuce and tomato on a fresh-baked Kaiser roll."" - That's what the last line in the description of Buffalo Chicken Sandwich says. Shame on you Manager for lying! Instead of admitting her fault, she was blaming it to a new menu!Not only did we have to pay for something that we didn't order or eat, but we got sub-standard food that was different from what was described in the menu, and had to deal with a really bad waitress and insensitive and deceitful manager to top off the whole experience. I am never going to come back to any Eat N Park location ever again, and will never recommend one to any of my friends either. What a waste of time and money! Plus dealing with callous and lying people - my goodness, I surely had my patience tested this evening!

"Guy's Jumbot Plate O'Crap - Made a special trip in with my son this morning to enjoy the food at the Dor-Stop.We both made the same order Guy's Jumbot. When the order arrived mine was over cooked , the egg portion resembled the dry pressed paper used in the egg carton. My serving was served without cheese. My son's was fine. When I went to pay and said something I got a vacant stare and I am so sorry. I ended up with a take out for my dog to eat. teh toast was perfect though. I started makeing this hour long trek with family members about a year ago. We would come out about every 4-6 weeks. The last two trips the quality has started to slip a little...but never to this extent that it really mattered.Save yourself the effort ....This is not a Diner, this is not a drive-in...this does not even rank high enough to be a Dive. Denny's would be a better choice.

"For what it's worth, dor-stop isn't good as people say it was. People are fanatical about this place and its food. Is their food really tasty or they're popular because the network show From my perspective, I detest their service, the service is notoriously horrible and unacceptable. Also the food was unpalatable. I order pumpkin flavor pancakes and side order scramble eggs. I was too full and their portion is huge so I left two pieces of pancakes. The waitress don't even bother to ask me if I need a box to take it home or if everything is good. Although she did refilled my coffee once, I barely see her stop by and there wasn't too many people in the diner is isn't likely she is occupied by that amount of customers.I think the waitress was rude because she never say thank you during the entire breakfast even when I tipped her. I should have known, I just feel like they treated me differently that's all. This review is based on my dinning experience and the service. Seriously if they mean business they should improve. Especially waitress was lack of enthusiasm. Do I want to come back Never ever.

"This place has the worst french fries I have ever tasted. They were literally BLACK. All I tasted was burnt oil. My photo is the zucchini planks and that lump of blackness are the French fries that I was sent home with. I could not even eat one! I also ordered the zucchini planks and a grilled cheese on rye with bacon. The grilled cheese was incredibly dry and the cook put the bread together upside down, like it did not match up...One piece of bread was the opposite way than the other. Also the sandwich did not stick together like a melted sandwich should. Ugh. The zucchini planks were delicious. 1 out of 3 is not great. My sister raved about this place. I am so disappointed. Disgusting. DO NOT EAT HERE. I spent $30 for only one edible thing worth $4. So pissed!

"I was really excited the day after new years to get a bagel with my best friends I traveled all the way from Milwaukee to see. Upon arrival, the place was pretty busy with people who obviously frequented the establishment often. We don't have many Bruegger's in Wisconsin so it was my first time here and it was not an enjoyable experience to say the least.It began by me placing my order and asking for my sandwich without the tomato spread. The worker actually interrupted me mid sentence to ask which bagel. I politely stated my preference and moved along. The older gentlemen working the cash register asked what we got. I said what bagel and my boyfriend also asked for 2 hazelnut coffees. The cashier responded with, K..... I asked okay and he responds with, I need to know what size.... I shrugged it off and was like well whatever maybe he's bummed to be working on new years.Then, when I get my bagel it has the tomato spread on it, which I politely asked for it without, yet was interrupted. The man literally says, ""Ma'am I don't know what you actually ordered and TOMATO is different than TOMATO SPREAD. Like I'm sorry... WHAT! the sandwich comes with only one kind of tomato.. pretty sure that's impossible to get confused with. I tried so hard to not say a big screw you too. He made a huge deal about the whole thing and if he wasn't so rude when we were paying I probably would've shrugged it off. I had too much pride though.THEN, he comes up to me and says MA'AM just so you know you were over charged because you ordered incorrectly. You shouldn't do that next time. K. Maybe if you took the time for decent customer service and realize we obviously have never been to a Bruegger's.And to put this into perspective, I worked at a breakfast place last year on new years day and not once did I feel the need to be that rude to anyone. It sucks but it's not my fault....

"Went to a High Tea here on Sunday.  Although the setting was lovely and the staff was welcoming, the food was nothing special, in fact, it was bad.  We were served three tea sandwiches:  egg salad, which was bland (I make a better version at home), chicken salad, nothing special either, and then a delicious spinach-artichoke bite.  Unfortunately, it was the size of a quarter, it was literally a bite.  But it was the best part of the meal!!!  (I don't think the size of all three of the sandwiches put together was as big as one piece of white bread).We were offered two types of scones:  cranberry and eggnog.   Neither was anything special, eggnog had absolutely no taste whatsoever!Then, the pastries:  we were served a gingerbread cupcake which was fine--nothing like Vanilla Pastry Shop!  A pumpkin torte, again, fine.  And a chocolate moussebrownie bite with a raspberry and candy cane on top--it was dry as a bone!  It looked as if it was on it's last legs--chocolate was turning white, mouse separated from brownie.  Yuck.  Oh yeah--I had a delicious tea from Harney and Sons (used to be sold at the Grand Floridian High Tea in Disney World), cinnamon spice!!!  Unfortunately, when I asked for more tea, they gave me new hot water and the same old tea bag! I've gone to various teas so I feel I can give a good comparison.  Not impressed at all!  Will not go back there, ever!

"I really hate giving bad reviews, but the seafood was terrible here.  You could tell we were eating old shrimp. The salmon was also old and had a super strong, fish odor.  Cost was too expensive. We paid $50 for two dinners one pop and one margarita.  The salsa was just ok.  The only thing that was good was the margarita, but I went there for seafood. Very disappointing.

"After months of passing this place and wanting to try their food, we finally made it to KKL.  What we weren't expecting from this place was the very pricey menu for fish, shrimp and chips (french fries from a bag, I'm sure)!  The shrimp was different and tastey, I had 4 pieces with chips and also a side of mushrooms.  Chris had clams, chips and a side of cole slaw and of course we ordered the hushpuppies which everyone raves about.  This meal was close to $30 dollars!   Some people may feel that isn't bad for lunch at a seafood place, however for the area the food, which isn't like just from the ocean, it's from a bag - it's way too much money and your gut will feel like a grease pit after eating here!My advice, skip this place if you can!

"Do I really have to give them even one star In the area so i dropped in for a quick lunch.  Had the shrimp plate with fries. Here goes:1.  The prices are outrageously high considering location, restaurant decor and quality of food. You cannot have lunch here for less than $11 unless you order one shrimp.  Any local chinese buffet will give you shrimp for a lot less than that.2. My shrimp looked like long barrels rather than a shrimp shape. This is due to the fact that they cut the shrimp in the middle and almost split it to make it look longer.3.  The shrimp had too much batter.  At one point the ""shrimp""( what was left of it after I took a bite), came out and the ""barrel of fried batter"" was left4.  The french fries were from a bag --frozen.Being from the East Coast, I know what fresh seafood tastes like. This is NOT it folks.  This place makes Long John Silver seem like a 5 star restaurant and it's a lot cheaper too.  It is an outrage as a ""restaurant"".  All they do is fry up every piece of seafood that YOU can buy frozen at CostCo or Sam's.Don't do this to yourself.  When you are in the area and hungry, go to the Jack in the Box across the street or some other fast food place. You'll be better off. and.... I cannot believe that the people who gave this place 4  and 5 stars are for real. They have to be the relatives of the owners.  There is no other explanation.

Clams were bland as well, I've had frozen that were better. Cocktail sauce was even bland. Seriously, if you like eating at convalescent homes this is your place. Otherwise, look elsewhere.

"Coworkers suggested Mandy's, so I swung by for some dinner. Ordered a special of 3 pieces of cod & 3 shrimp with fries & a drink. Asked for the 1 cod with English breading, the other 2 with cornmeal. Got the reverse. The shrimp were fine. Nothing special. The cornmeal cod was perfect. Cooked just right & crunchy as expected. The English style were over-breaded, greasy, flat, small pieces of some non-cod white fish that was so overcooked it was black.Never got a cup for a drink, but I'm not a soda drinker to begin, so no major loss. Yet still feel jipped. The fries were limp & flavorless. Not impressed at all. Either my coworkers have crappy taste or the cook at dinner time had a very off night. Considering there was one other person in there, it's not like they were rushed & should've messed up the order to this level of epic bad. Made me wish Jack in the Box would bring back their fish & chips n

"My first & last order. I had Mandy's Special 3 fish & 3 shrimp, fried mushrooms, clam strips, coleslaw & potato salad. The clam strips were good portion size was tiny, mushrooms were nicely breaded & picture perfect looking, but mushy inside & tasted like the frying oil was used over & over to cook both clams & shrimp. The shrimp actually had an oily taste & mouth feel. My coleslaw had actual 14 inch slices of carrots & onions, while the potato salad was all mush along with the ff. I got the cod fish. After I finished blotting the oil from the pieces & reheated them it wasn't bad I just couldn't understand why I was in the kitchen cooking when I had ordered out. For the money I certainly expected better. Sadly I really love seafood.....usually.

"You know I have tried to like Sir Edmond's, I really have.  I've gone there a bunch of times, and I really like the outdoor patio seating, especially the big cherry tree that has such beautiful blossoms in the spring and would be the perfect place to take a chick on a first or second date, and they do have a descent selection of brew on draught, I do like Ye Old Speckled Hen, but well, their food sucks.  The last time I went there I ordered the fish and chips, mainly cause this is a pub and I was feeling nostalgic for my days in London, so I wanted some fish and chips, and thought they might actually be good...Wrong!  The fish and the batter were uncooked, and I had to send it back not once, not twice, not three times, but four times, and on the last time, it still wasn't right I just didn't feel like sitting there anymore, and my brother had already finished his burger, which did look good.  Did the waitress offer me anything for my trouble, nope.  Which brings me to my next complaint, the service and the whole atmosphere is really kind of rude, and stuffy, maybe I'm just not cool enough, but they always seem to busy to serve me, and the whole low ceiling basement bar thing is not my bag.

"I don't give 1-star often, but I think this ""staple"" has earned it with the ""winning"" combo of overpriced food & beer, lack of menu options, and non-existent service. I came here on Friday to join a few friends after work for drinks and for the free personalized Guinness pint glass offer. The bartender turned out to be also the waiter for us in the back dining room, which means we seldomly saw him. He wasn't exactly friendly, but I guess he got the job done at the minimum since he did bring us our beer and put in our food order and checked on us every now and then... but was a smile that hard to come by Do I really have to be a regular to get any friendly service Worst was the food runner... which we didn't know that's her only job there (not like they have waitstaff uniforms on for us to distinguish). So when a late comer asked her to take his beer order, she snapped back ""I am not your waiter!""  WELL, thank goodness she wasn't our waiter with that attitude. More interestingly, this very same food runner had to deliver a dish to the corner table next to ours that was blocked in by 2 big tables (ours and another one). Instead of doing her job the right way and walk around the both big tables to get to the corner table, she just pretty much demanded my friend to get up & push in the chair, so she could squeeze by... how lazy and unprofessional was that! That pretty much set the tone for an unpleasant night for me.To add salt in a wound, besides Guinness that was on special at the bargain price of $4, Fat Tire was $5... I didn't think Fat Tire is that caliber of a beer. Food was pricey as well, $4 for a basket of fries but with curry sauce (which would be the only reason I order frieschips in an English pub) is $5, $14 for fish & chips and that didn't look like a huge order. They had more wings options than anything thing else... but if I want wings I probably would have gone to somewhere else. I ended up with $8.50 of blacken fish tacos. It was ok, the fish still had lots of liquid after being cooked, which didn't mix well with the slaw and tortilla wrap. I did enjoy the cup of soup as my side. In short, I echo the other reviewer: I'll go to Big Ben any day over this joint if I am feeling a British pub mode. At least they have better menu options, and most certainly better service.

I really don't think I've ever had such a rude waitress. One of the many instances where she was rude was when she messed up my order. I politely asked about the missing cheese in my order of cheese fries. After she picked up the plate, my friend asked for his appetizer (she brought my order but hadn't taken his). She cut him off y sternly saying, ""How about I fix his fries first before they get cold!"" Then walked away. When she brought them back, she said, ""Next time you want cheese, tell me!"" Our entire group was speechless.I have never had a worse experience at any restaurant in my life. I highly recommend you avoid the place.

"Used to be my favorite! It has gotten worse and worse every time I have gone here over the years. This last experience takes the cake. I ordered a hamburger with no mustard, no mayo, and cheddar cheese. It came out with swiss cheese (not a big deal,) but it also had mustard and mayo. I let the server know, and I must note that I was not mean or rude about it at all. Mistakes happen.The burger came back moments later with cheddar cheese slapped on top of the swiss, and the mustard and mayo gone..... How does someone get mustard and mayo out of the nooks and crannies of a burger..... By rinsing it with water, I presume. So the burger came back cold, slightly wet, cheddar cheese (not melted) on top of the old cheese. Disgusting. Absolutely disgusting. The server said nothing, even when he saw me not even take one bite. After approaching the manager, she took it off the bill. I am not saying that I need anything for free, but I did come there to eat, left hungrier than I arrived, and then STILL had to go through the chick-fil-a drive thru after paying $30 for 2 drinks and the meal of the other person at the table.Never again.

"My friday night at Avenue Bar was one to remember. Not because it had the best food or the best service but because my visit proves you can't always judge a restaurant by ranking or reviews. I will not be returning anytime soon.  My goal in writing this review is not to bash on the Avenue Bar. you won't need to after you read my play by play of the night. 7:00-3 friends and myself arrive at the restaurant. We give our name and head to the bar being told it was an hour wait to be seated. Thank god basketball was on tv or we might have fallen asleep waiting.8:20-we are seated in the back room right next to the kitchen. We had the luxury of sitting in foldup metal chairs on at a pull out card table with a cheap plastic table cloth-not the cool wooden tables or a booth like in the bar room. I honestly felt discriminated against because we were 24 year olds. I saw no young people seated in the bar room and saw so many booths with two people at them I thought it was universal date night. Instead we were with ""our type"" in the back room receiving second hand service. My waitress spilled water on me while attempting to fill my glass and just giggled and put napkins over it. Haha are you serious Again, thank god there were big screen TVs to watch or I might have cried out loud. 8:45- fish fry arrives; soggy, greasy, and not very warm. Best part of my meal was the spotted cow and cheese curds for an app. 9:15-I feel sick and want to go to sleep. My night is over.Advice for anyone under the age of 30- don't eat here. Go somewhere fun where you are treated equally. Food and drinks-30 bucks. Gas money to get there-6 bucks. Never eating there again-priceless. Thanks for reading

I ordered the fish fry and he had the eggplant parmesan. The fish fry was average and the french fries were dissapointing and boring. My boyfriend's eggplant parm was more like a lasgana and was cold in the middle. With a bill that was over fifty dollars for food and one beer, I expected more than just heated frozen food. The dinner was a waste of money. Unfortunately we will not go back. I will say that at least our server was very welcoming and great at his job.

We were informed the Htg wasn't working but it was fine in the dining room.  We tried to open the door between but was rudely informed by the chef we could not do so. I'm a long term customer and that attitude was never part of the Avenue Bar.  And what chef dictates who gets to be warm or cold.

"I have been to Christy's quite a few times over the years and have never had a very good meal; however, last night's meal was a disaster! It started with the bartender getting our drink order wrong, One member of our party received a different potato than ordered, 1 had a different salad dressing than ordered and I had the worst fish fry EVER. It could have been good if the breading wasn't soggy on one piece and excessively crispy with holes in it (looked exactly like a funnel cake!). The baked potato tasted dry and leftover. The one high point was a waitress (first night on the job) that was very friendly and actually cared about our poor experience. Christy's is back on my list of places to avoid.

"CRAP service! We had made reservations for at least 16 people for dinner a week prior to dining there. They managed to get the tables together, that's about it. While waiting for our group to arrive, we had drinks outside...we should've gone directly to the Tiki Bar to get our drinks, that woman knew what she was doing!...our ""waitress"" however, probably couldn't velcro her own shoes. When we sat to eat, we had 2 waitresses (they decided it took 2 to wait on us). One ROCKED IT, the other couldn't velcro her own shoe. Our 12 of the grouptable had to deal with our appetizers being put in front of us (with a ""who's is it!"" call from the same waitress who took our order) then our meal being placed in front of us not 15 seconds later. My 5 year old daughter not only got a very cold (""made fresh"") pizza, but it included something we didn't order....a dead fly between the pizza and plate it was served on. Now...I would've sent it back, but I didn't want to wait until midnight for my kid to get her food! Not to mention my son only got half of what he ordered....After our ""lovely"" experience with dinner, we stuck around for drinks. All I can say is...you better have cleavage to get a drink inside...no matter how busy or slow they are! If you want to sit and have a drink and look at the lake... Go to their Tiki Bar...Debbie ROCKS!!!! She's the only one that knows what ""good service"" is!!!!

"This place is good only for the outdoor atmosphere. Their online menu does not correspond to their actual menu, buy they don't seem to see this as a problem. I requested my favorite beer: ""Oh, we're out of that."" Then, my second favorite: ""We're out of that too."" As a vegetarian, I had to order a black bean burger, which was burned, as was the bun. I asked for a dark or spicy mustard. No, they just have the mainstream basics. Combine this with extremely mediocre service. I will never eat there again.

"Worst service EVER! We sat down at a dirty table (because all the tables were dirty) around 12:15 pm. We ordered margaritas on the rocks WITH salt. We got no salt so we waited another 5-10 mins for our salted margs. Then we waited for our order to be taken for about another 10-15 mins while our server was standing next to the kitchen. Well, we ordered and it was NOW 1:57pm and our food was still not to our table. One of us had ordered nachos and at 1:57 they came to tell us they were out of tortilla chips! Are you joking That's something they should have known from first hand! I will NEVER go back! I've worked in restaurants since I was 15 and I've never seen any sort of thing like this before! We were not the only table waiting for our food that long either.....

"Just got back from this restaurant for the third time. It is close to where we live and like the convenience of going there. This was the last time though. When we arrived we where told we needed to wait 5 to 10 mins for a seat. After 15 mins we where seated in a room with 10 open tables (not sure why we needed to wait).  About another 15 mins went by and 2 other tables where seated and served drinks and still no one waited on us.  No one ever did so we left. The other times that we have been the food is only mediocre for bar food at best.

"Honestly, I'm furious. I enjoyed PF Chang's restaurants in the Chicago area, and my wife and I have eaten a few times at this Pittsburgh-area location. Over the last year, we have tried repeatedly, but the 90-120 minute wait for dinner is unacceptable. We tried going early, late -- it never made any difference. The front staff was rude, and the wait was too long.Tonight, we had a special date planned, and made reservations a week in advance. We came in the door exactly on time, waited in the line to see the front staff, and we were promptly handed a pager. They couldn't tell us when we would be seated.I imagined a short wait, so we went outside, crossed into a store to wait (since the entrance of this location is so packed, it's impossible to wait at the bar or in the meager seating).After 20 minutes we gave up. We went back to PF Chang's and the front office staff still couldn't tell us when we would be seated. I saw open tables.What on earth is the point of accepting reservations if you do not honor themThe food here is good, but certainly not great. We went to a local Thai place and were seated with no problem in 5 minutes. The food was much better, the service was good even in a crowded busy restaurant. Oh, and the local place was a much more reasonable price.We certainly will never visit PF Chang's again.

"This was my first time at this PF Chang's and I was not impressed. The service was extremely slow even though it was a Sunday night and the restaurant was not very busy. The portions were small.

"We went last night Saturday night to P.F.Chang located at the Kierlands in Scottsdale. Terrible Experience!!! after waiting over one hour to be seated, we ordered calamari for appetizer which came with a horrible strange salty sauce and salt and pepper mix on the side. then I ordered beef and broccoli and my husband ordered a vegetarian dish with peanut sauce . After a long wait my food came so salty that I could not even eat and as much as I hate to complain but I had to let the waiter know, so he went to get me one with less salt. My husband's dish was OK. then the second one was a bit less salty but the meat had a terrible liver kind of taste which totally turned my stomach. I feel the reason they added so much salt was to hide the bad tasting rotted meat. Very bad experience. Our waiter was kind and sympathetic. ruined my evening out :(

"Let me start off by saying I have mostly simple tastes, and my favorite lunch spot for Chinese has been the New Dumpling House in Squirrel Hill. But since that restaurant is undergoing renovations, I was forced to try something new.So... I thought I'd try the chain PF Chang's Chinese Restaurant at the Waterfront. Wow, what an unsatisfying mistake that turned out to be.I started with a cup of their Wonton soup. At $2.95 it wasn't too outrageous of a price, the broth had some flavor and there was much more in it than I was used to, including three giant basil (I think) leafs that covered everything beneath. In the broth were chunks of chicken, two shrimp, some sliced water chestnuts and two ""pork""-filled wontons. As I said, the broth had decent flavor, but the wontons were thick, doughy and under-cooked, and the chicken chunks were dry, which is amazing since they were drowned in broth! On a scale of bad to good, it was kind of meh.Next came my ""lunch-portion"" order of Chang's Kung Pao Chicken (the dinner portion is $5 more). At the New Dumpling House, this dish is served with a delectable dark, rich, tangy sauce, which I was really hoping for... Not at PF Chang's. On my plate I received about 8 quarter-size chunks of lightly breaded and browned chicken, 7 hot Chinese red chili peppers (mostly inedible unless they are diced into a sauce), a handful of blanched, unsalted peanuts, a few sliced scallions, and a bed of the most bland brown rice I have ever encountered. Uncle Ben would've been ashamed if that stuff came out of one of his boxes.Glaringly, there was NO SAUCE!. None at all.I've had Kung Pao Chicken in New York City, San Francisco, and even from a hole in the wall in Bethel Park, PA that was much, much better. Never have I had it served in such a bland, skimpy, and overpriced way! The ""lunch-portion"" cost was $9.95.At The New Dumpling House, I could have a delicious lunch, with soup, entree and complimentary hot tea, and I could leave satisfied with just $8 out-of-pocket -- and that includes the tip.The service was decent. However, lesson learned. One and done. Never going back to PF Changs.

"I was so disappointed with the quality... the salad was drenched in vinegar, the duck was mediocre.  I guess I'm used to really good food from foodie towns.  If I wanted mediocre food, I would go to fridays or olive garden-- was it comparable  Yes, for quality of food.  The price, obviously, was much more.  This fake fusion place would have gone out of business, regardless of price, if it had to compete with the likes of Slanted Door or was located in a city with good food.  If this is representative of the best Pittburgh has to offer, then take the money you would have spent here and reinvest it in a trip to SF or NYC and eat well for a week. How sad is that  Don't go here... you pay $30 for an entree, $10 for an appetizer, and $15 for a mediocre wine.  Not worth it...

"Hands down the most disrespectful and terrible lounge in pittsburgh. Appalling service, I went there with 6 people, restaurant was empty and sat there for twenty minutes with staff walking by.

"We have been regulars at Soba for years, sharing a few appetizers at the bar-lounge on a quiet evening and enjoying the food. Last night was different. For the very first time the food was awful.  A scallion pancake replaced the kimchee pancake. The chef, who we learned was new, obviously had no idea that a pancake is the glue that holds a tasty morsel together. This was pure glue, tasteless and sticky. Where was the content, the taste, the flavor The lump-crab egg roll was worthy of a corner take-out Chinese eatery, oily mostly. A pulled pork appetizer was passable, nowhere near the dish it replaced. find a new chef quickly.John E. Raffie.

"The food here was greasy, uninspired and bland. The mockmeat ""chicken"" was too chewy and the dish felt oily and heavy.

Not to be recommended unless you're desperate.

"People who reviewed this place as being GOOD... obviously retain the taste buds of a snake (fyi: snakes have no taste buds).Came here with my parents while we were scoping out apartments for me to live in. Wanted to go to Pamela's, but the line was too long so we walked a few doors down to China Palace. I was REALLY wary because I did a quick Yelp search before we walked in, but my dad insisted that it was probably ""not that bad"".Here's what we ordered:- Cheese wontons (Um... they literally just fried american cheese in the wontons. Who does that! It's supposed to be CREAM CHEESE!! And they gave us some disgusting mustard sauce to dip it in.)- Chicken Lo Mein- Beef Lo Mein- Shrimp and Broccoli w Sweet and Sour Soup (The soup was the most disgusting texture of I-don't-know-what. Needless to say, that was left untouched.)Let's just say, not only did it take 30-40 minutes to get our food (for food that was of LESSER quality than Chinese takeout), the food itself was just utterly disappointing... A complete travesty to Chinese cuisine. It was bland, yet greasy and MSG-ridden (if that makes any sense). Not only that, they also didn't have BEEF CHOW FUN (ok, so whoever claims this restaurant serves ""authentic"" Chinese food clearly has no clue on what they're talking about). And the kicker It came out to about $32 + tip for food that we DIDN'T even finish half of. We literally just got up mid-meal when we overheard the table behind us complaining about how they found a dead fruit fly in their bowl of rice.DO NOT GO HERE!!! ... unless you're a snake that is.

"In sum, we ordered take out here a few days ago. There were bugs in my egg drop soup. Nuff said.Usually, I write these long reviews. Not today. I ordered two orders of soup Hot and Sour and Egg Drop. I only eat the Hot and Sour the night we ordered our take out. I specifically ordered the Egg Drop to have for lunch yesterday. Fortunately for me- I noticed the bugs prior to eating. Looked like a bunch of fruit flies made their way into the soup. Disgusting.

"Yuck! I  hadn't eaten here in years and it will be years until I return. The wonton soup was watery, and the wontons were inedible.

"I have never, ever thrown food away, but I couldn't stomach this stuff. I got the pork fried rice and egg drop soup. Holy moly was that a poor decision. The rice tasted like a flavorless mush with chewy ""pork"". It tasted nothing like pork, or meat for that matter. I tried adding soy sauce for some kind of flavor but dear lord that didn't help. The soup was a weird creamy mess. My friend got the general tso chicken, which should generally be a safe choice. WRONG. cardboard. Cardboard with a strange tangy sauce and a side of disaster. Seriously we've never been so grossed out that we had to throw out $20 worth of food but that's what happened.

"Disgusting...The general tso that I ordered for delivery tasted like fish. I called and Verna tried to convince me that it was because I made the mistake of not requesting white meat. She then tried to tell me that they don't deep fry anything with fish. This was interesting because I am sure that the shrimp egg rollls that I ordered were indeed deep fried...in the same oil that my chicken was fried in. She told me that the delivery driver would be there in an hour to pick it up and i call and she tells me that they only way for me to get the refund is if I bring it in myself. Very rude and horrible customer service

"Had a craving for Chinese the other day while I was in Shadyside and wandered into China Palace.  How this place can stay in business in an area that I consider to be more sophisticated is a real mystery.  It was just awful and the service was terrible.I wanted to have the assorted appetizer platter, but asked if I could substitute one of the items with dumplings.  Our waiter had to ask the manager.  After much whispering, the manager came back to me and told me that I could have dumplings...then I asked if I could get the fried dumplings with that instead of steamed.   Well I was met with an outraged ""NO""!!!!  It kind of surprised me that I got this kind of reaction.  I was told that the chef would have to fry 2 dumplings just for my platter.  I looked around and there were only 2 other people in the entire restaurant.  Isn't that what they're supposed to do  Cook food for people to eat  I would have never asked if I thought it would be such a big deal.  Anyway, the food was not very good.  In fact, it was awful.  Were they having an off day   I'm not sure they were.   There's never any reason to be rude to your patrons.  No need to ever return.

"Having limited options in Uptown I gave this place a few chances.  It's just not good.  I got some eel that wasn't fresh and I haven't been able to eat eel since.  I also think their miso soup is actually chicken broth with some miso tossed in.

"Probably the only restaurant that the service was so terrible that I have left before getting my food. Me and my boyfriend went here with a groupon, that we had purchased specifically for Fujo. They refused to take it, and the manager told us, ""you have two choices, ask for a refund from groupon or just eat here without it."" If we had been rude then I wouldn't be able to blame him, but we had politely and calmly spoke to them and asked about it. We walked out and went to Emzy for sushi instead and it had great service and excellent food.

"While there were no insect carcasses in my food, I was still not very impressed with my meal at PF Chang's.  I went for a ""business lunch"" with my boss.  Who thought I would ever enjoy working more than eating--I think this meal was a first!I got steamed veggies and brown rice.  Now I expected it to be pretty bland, since it mentioned no sauces added at all.  But the vegetables were rubbery, not crisp like they should be after a good steaming. The rice was pretty underdone as well, so all-in-all, they got nothing right.  I tried adding some sauces to liven it up a bit, but it was too little, too late.Perhaps the biggest disappointment was the egg drop soup.  I usually add pepper to mine because I like the extra kick, but this needed much more help than a little pepper.  It was very bland, and didn't taste like anything.  Tasteless egg in water is definitely NOT something you want to keep eating.  And, of course, there was no salt and pepper on the table, so I couldn't even enjoy it the way I like. Because I didn't pay, I didn't complain to the waiter, but normally this would not have passed by me.  Though the lunch prices are pretty reasonable, I still would not return here if given the choice.

"I had a horrible experience getting take out from the local PF Changs take out. I had been home and not feeling well the last couple of days craving take out from PF Chang's. I found it the worst food I have ever gotten at from PF Changs in 2 states in the last 10 years. The gallon of ""fresh"" tea was so syrupy I could not drink it. The vegetarian dish had soggy vegetables and awful tasting curry that I could not eat it. The side order of fried green beans was soft, soggy, and very cold with a poorly made fish sauce on the side. I could not eat any of it and I spent a small fortune ordering for my family. I would have returned it for a reorder, however I have been getting over an illness and not able to drive. My daughter who picked it up had to leave. What happened to this restaurant It was an awful dining experience and I do expect some type of reparation for this terrible eating experience. I ended up eating crackers and peanut butter at home instead. Just awful!To add insult to injury, this is the same restaurant where I found that the wait staff would pocket the change from the bill when paid with cash. I let this pass the first time and the 2nd time I asked the manager if this was their policy, with an embarrassed looks from the nearby wait staff. I used to absolutely love this chain, however it has become a poor excuse for a restaurant. I wrote the main office

"Consistently disappointing...I struggled with whether to provide 1 or 2 stars and finally landed on one due to several factors: experience, price, and overall poor food quality.  Having visited PFs several times in the past I had vowed not to return but was persuaded by my wife and the nagging popularity of the place that has me asking myself: 'Maybe I am missing something here'...We did takeout and were told when we called that it would require an hour to prepare the food (we had called at 6PM and were expecting a little time, however that seemed excessive).  Upon arrival they had screwed up the order and to their credit did try to make things right by providing the food error to us for free while working 'on a rush' to correct the mistake.  All fine and good, but caused a delay of 25 minutes for our food with a screaming 2 week old in the car.  We had Lo Mein that was excessively greasy while the vegetables lacked any crisp.  The dish had little flavor behind the grease, but with enough Sararchi sauce I could numb my mouth beyond taste. It felt like a dish that had been reheated in the microwave.  The portion was large, but whats a good sized portion if the food is low quality.  My wife had crispy honey shrimp that was slightly better, but the portion in this case was on the skimpy side.  Their heralded lettuce wraps were just OK as well, with more water chestnuts than chicken and again lacking much flavor. With the overall poor experience we will steer of PFs in the future and look for smaller, more locally owned operations for our Aisan fix.

"Another bad experience two times in a row. There must be a shortage of waitstaff in Charlotte because these people shouldn't even be working at Walmart. Both times we went for lunch and took an hour and a half. They served soup which took almost 40 minutes to get egg drop and it look like low tide in Louisiana. Big chunks of gray and black eggs floating in my egg drop soup, waitress looking at me like I was crazy. The manager came over to serve our food and asked how is everything I mention I was going to write a bad Yelp review and he said well thank you and walked away. This place used to have a long wait and now there's nobody ever there, now I understand why. Portions are small, service is bad and probably better off going to McDonald's.

"I ordered take out from this P.F. Chang's on Tuesday night and have to say that is was terrible. Not only I was the food ready 45min later than the time frame they gave me over the phone, the food was soggy, underprepard and bland. For example, the Kung Pao Shrimp was not fried as it is supposed to be and doughy. My family always orders this dish in various locations and this was by far the worst. Delay and food preparations aside, what really sets me off is that I not only waited 45 min to receive my food (altogether the preparation time was well over 60min), I have received nothing from the management as an apology but plenty of negative attitude. Maybe I am spoiled but in every P.F. Changs I have been so far, I have received a credit on the bill or a voucher if something is off. This time I have received nothing (only a half hearted apology of the manager). in my opinion, if a customer waits 45min in the restaurant for a $110 pickup order made on the phone, prepays AND still gives $5 tip, I expect to get something off the bill. Here, however, I have received nothing.I will not visit this restaurant anymore and cannot recommend it. Sadly it has lost its game - maybe it was the Tusday manager.

"Absolutely horrible experience. We were seated and drink order was taken by that person. Few mins later drinks were dropped off by a different person who said waitress would be over to take our order. Then 10 mins later someone came over and asked us if we wanted appetizers which we did and ordered Crab Rangoons and Spare Ribs. This person said someone would be back to take our order. Never happened. The apps came out and the guy said again someone would come take our order. So we ate our apps and still no one. No one even acknowledged us, I had to flag someone down and I said ""I think our waitress has forgotten about us..."" The man says ""what you want"" ummm to order Hes like ""Yes, what you want just staring at us, no smile or apology. So we ordered and got our food about 10 mins later. Had to wait forever for our check. I think we had a different server every time someone stopped by. The Crab Rangoons were simply not Crab Rangoons. There was no cream cheese flavor whatsoever. I am not sure what they were, but not what I was expecting. The Shrimp Fried Rice tasted ok but the Shrimps were full of poo. Not deveined and completely packed with poo. Just disgusting. Wonton soup flavor was good but the actual wontons must have had a teaspoon of ginger in them. Strong and not really what I was expecting in a wonton...Whole dinner sucked. To top it off there was vomit all over the womens bathroom floor. No idea why this place was full. Many great chinese restaurants around, this is not one.

"This place is bad! The service is bad, the food is bad and the prices are high! With our party of 4, we had a similar experience as Christina L. Where different waiterswaitresses would come by and awkwardly take our order, then someone else would bring out that order and then someone else would arrive to help us further.. The crab rangoons were very small and tasted generic, like something I could buy frozen at food lion and the shrimp in our meals ALSO were not deveined... And every dish we ordered was flavorless and bland... The only thing I enjoyed was the wonton soup! And then at the end of our meal, around 9:45pm we stayed at the table to chat.. Being cautious that the restaurant hours printed on the door said they close at 11pm.. A waitress came to us at 10pm and said that they were closing and they needed us to pay now... O_o  So we got up to pay and leave and the cashier man ( looked like the manager ) was so cold.. He never asked how the food was or anything, just ""this how much!"" And swiped the cards... Such a waste of money and time.. Worst Chinese food ever!

"No go. Bought the Groupon despite the other reviews and decided to give this place a try. The location, atmosphere, and service were all good so no complaints there. The food however was not. I ordered the general chicken with brown rice and an egg roll. The chicken was all slimy dark meat and the flavor was nothing like general sauce but rather 100% strong garlic. I wasn't able to even eat hardly any of it because of the brown slimy meat. My husband ordered the garlic beef and he did not like the sauce at all. It had zero garlic taste, was way too thick, and overall wasn't very good. The egg roll was soft and mushy and is a shrimp roll so not your typical chickencabbage type. The place was super busy and I had high hopes, but ultimately the food itself was not good and we will not be back.

"Average food. You can tell they use cheap steak and lobster. The sauces are not good and they are constantly rushing you. I literally had my soup and salad delivered within 30 seconds of each other. Then the chef comes out to rush us. The server is stuck constantly refilling tiny glasses and trying to rush us so we have room for hot food from the chef. The chef was entertaining but the food wasn't very good. Large portions of noodles and vegetables. I guess they want big portions to make up for poor quality. Doesn't work. Then the server comes out to rush us into boxing up our food. The very minute the chef is done! How about we get some time to eat and talk! Boxes were left at the table while we were still eating so that The server could return to constantly filling tiny glasses. We wanted to make sure the chef got tipped out, but came to find he splits them with the server... even. That is just wrong. The servers are running around hustling people through dinner so they can get the next table in.  The place cuts too many corners and rushes you through dinner. It's not very good. And they take advantage of the wait staff. Did I mention the hostesses were rude Find somewhere better to eat.

"I've hesitated to write about Fate. I always enjoyed the food and experience at the owner's old Lucky Dragon, even back when it was on University. I also appreciate the fact that Fate is a downtown pioneer, and that one can eat there after 9:00.We've been to Fate a number of times, with vaguely disappointing results. After this visit -- we've had it. I'm not really high on the ""this happened when i went there one time so it must happen all the time"" style of user review. So, let me state that everything that happened on this visit has also happened during previous visits, yet never all at once. Fate, however, put it all together this time to deliver a really memorable fiasco. I don't know if Fate's policy is to have the hostesshost inform everyone waiting for a table that the wait is going to be fifteen minutes, but the math doesn't work out. The place is tiny. We waited forty minutes. The next group waited fifty-five minutes. The next few groups are probably still waiting, their once-vital bodies deteriorating into skeletons.The server dropped off some menus, mentioned that she was going to bring us some water, and then vanished as if she were an illusionist's assistant. Again, Fate is tiny, so the trick was pretty difficult.Anyway, we ordered after she rematerialized (after the required fifteen minutes). Stuff arrived. It was the old joke -- ""the food here is terrible... and such small portions!""I'll spare most of the hideous details, but one lowlight to share involved the sesameshrimpsalad item. I'm hoping that the foul flavor and aroma was the result of some slightly-off fish sauce, rather than some slightly-off shrimp. Actually, why do I care We felt lousy afterwards and dosed up on the twin antidotes of water and mouthwash. Our cat still wouldn't come near us. Anyway, I don't mean to imply that the owner and staff at Fate are malicious. The food isn't good enough, and the experience isn't good enough. Oh, if you're uncomfortable with IKEA furnishings (I'm fine), don't even try it.

"This is one of those places that really pisses me off. The food is very good, the beer is even better, and the atmosphere is super-cool. It's just the type of place we need more of in downtown Phoenix. It's even open late!Unfortunately I have to give it one lonely star because the service so often SUCKS. More than once I'v been told that because I don't have a reservation I'd have to wait up to 45 minutes despite the fact that the place was less than 50% full.The final straw was in the middle of July, when I was asked to ""please wait outside"" for my table. Are you kidding me The food ain't THAT good.

"Sometimes I think that people are willing to let ANYTHING slide in order to avoid chain restaurants. That is why Fate is so successful.Fate has the rudest staff and worst ""wait"" policy of any restaurant in town. The worst part They make no apology for making you wait OUTSIDE for a table in 110 degree weather. Are they on crack Outside The whole bar is empty...yet patrons are relegated to the hot dirty front yard. Why do you make people wait outside when you are emptyOne time I went there and only TWO tables were occupied. They told us there would be a 20 - 30 minute wait. I asked why there is a wait as nearly ALL the tables were open. The dumb girl at the door kind of shrugged and said they weren't enough waiters. So there aren't enough waiters to handle THREE tables instead of twoAt least let us wait INSIDE. Despite the place being empty the mean lady told us to wait outside. I said NO THANKS. and stormed off NEVER to return. FATE IS MY WORST DINING EXPERIENCE IN ARIZONA SO FAR.Fate is less than 1 mile from my house, so it saddens me it isn't a place I can call home.

"I went to Fate because I had been hearing from people for a really long time that it was just a fantastic place and I really should try.  It happened to be right by the Roosevelt where we were actually going to meet up with some of you Yelpers.  You know who you are people.  Hi guys!  It was fun!We parked and walked up and went inside.  The decor was nice. It seemed to have a decent atmosphere but I am not the type to be suckered in by all that crap.  If a place sucks, I don't care how chic the atmosphere is.  I will call a spade a spade.  The place wasn't full, quite the opposite really.  Maybe 2 or 3 tables were occupied.  So we go up to the hostess and tell her we'd like a table for two and she says that it'll be about 5 minutes which I am fine with but when I ask her if we can wait in inside she says ""No.  Please wait outside.""  What the fuck is that about  I could understand if they were super busy and they didn't have any open tables for us to even sit at putting us in the way but if it weren't for the damn techno-look-at-me-I'm-cool music they were playing, you could hear crickets chirping in this joint.  Strike one!  So we go outside and wait.  She comes out after awhile and gives some other people that are waiting some drinks then tells us she'll be right back after she goes and grabs a couple of menus.  They must keep the menus in the parking lot or something because it took her awhile to come back.  She sits us in this corner that's pretty much hidden away from everything.  So here we are eating in a restaurant that I'm convinced people go to only to be seen and here we are not being seen.  Oh woe is me!  Woe, woe, woe is me!  However will I earn my cool points for the monthThe waitress was very nice and attentive.  I'll give them that but god damn could they keep this place any darker.  I realize it adds ambiance but when you're struggling to read the damn menu it's a little much.  Strike two!We order a couple of $4 Republic of Teas and the pot stickers then proceed to peruse the rest of the menu.  The variety is somewhat lacking and a common theme is sweetness.  As anyone who knows me will tell you, I don't do sweet.  So I order the Cantonese Dragon Beef and my significant other orders the Szechuan Chicken.The waitress comes back with the pot stickers.  They sucked.  They were identical to the ones you get at Costco.  They are just like the ones they serve at Casey Moore's during happy hour only there they're free.  Here they cost $6.  I eat one and that's it.  Strike three!Then comes the entrees.  Decent sized portions.  I can't really tell you if the presentation was good because it was so damn dark in there but I'll just give them the benefit of the doubt on that one.  Mine was in a word, crap.  The best thing you could say about it is that it tasted weird.  I didn't even like the mushrooms.  I am a mushroom fanatic.  If there are two things on a menu that both look awesome and one has mushrooms and the other doesn't, the mushrooms always tip the scales.  But they didn't even save this dish.  I am beginning to think the baseball metaphor wasn't the best route to go as here we are already at strike four.  So in my disappointment I decide to give my girlfriends Szechuan Chicken a try.  Baseball was definitely not the way to go because we're at strike five now.  So now my only option is the white rice that came with the dish.  This thankfully was perfectly adequate.  Now if I go to a fucking CHINESE restaurant and the best compliment I can give the food is ""At least they didn't fuck up the rice"", we are in some ugly territory here people.  If you're looking to go to some hip chic place cuz you want to here the latest spins from DJ Such and such, skip Fate, hit up Hunan Express and then just go straight to Myst or Drift or where ever the shiny shirts happen to be on that given night.  Nuf sed.

"Stay away. Far away.I had been hearing about Fate for a while. I had high expectations, since I had been to Lucky Dragon in the past (the owners prev joint) which was OK.It was the worst ChineseAsian I've had in AZ, the service was terrible, the chairs uncomfortable, and to top it off my fiancee got food poisoning.... and has been sick for the last 2 days from it. I took her to the ER this morning at 4:30 AM and decided to finally start posting on Yelp since I've been a lurker for a while.Aesthetics:Initially looks like a typical hipster restaurant like you might find in another city. Nice patio, cool inside.  However... The seating at a bus stop is more comfy. There is no chair back - just this high bar thing that digs into your back.I'm going to file this under aesthetics - we ordered the Hot and Sour soup (more on that later) and the waitress suggested it was large enough to share. However, they apparently don't have any kind of serving utensil, so we had to use our little soup spoons to serve ourself soup into another bowl out of this wide shallow terrine. WTFService:I don't know a nicer way to say it, our waitress was a dopey bimbo. It took 20 minutes for her to take our order. She went missing for long periods of time when I had an empty water glass, and then for a while longer after I tracked her down and asked for some. Not good.Food:I ran into a friend there, and he commented at how he loved the food and was surprised we didn't like it. To be blunt, it was utter crap. The hot and sour soup was thin and spicy. That's it. It tasted like chiles and a splash of rice wine vinegar- no other flavors present. It's not like any hot and sour soup I ever had.... in a bad way. There are these weird chewy dumplings like things in it that would be better served at protecting the floor from your chair leg. I ordered some Saigon basil something or other dish with beef, she ordered the Lemon Grass whatever with tofu.My dish was bad. The beef was sliced thin but tough and chewy, and totally lacked flavor. As for basil, there were 2 small basil leaves in the dish, and that's it. The sauce was thin and one dimensional. Her lemon grass dish was also bad. The sauce tasted like Tom Yum paste from the chinese grocery store mixed with some water. I felt bad for the poor abused tofu.I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants.... but Pei Wei and Pickup Sticks are about 10x better in terms of food quality and taste. Screw that, even the chinese place in the mall food court is better. I am not exaggerating. It was a very disappointing meal.Now for the nasty part.I drank water - Fiancee unit drank th 'Green Tea.' It was like no other green tea I ever had seen. It was leprechaun green, with some kind of milk like substance in it.I thought it looked kinda funky, but she drank it.It was the only difference between our meals. I tried hers, she tried mine, etc. I didn't drink the science experiment tea.Well... Several hours later she started having stabbing stomach pains. She spent the whole night up vomiting and with diarrhea.  2 days later the vomiting has subsided but she's missed 2 days of school and is still pooping up a storm. I took her to the ER at 4:30 AM this morning and they confirmed the symptoms were consistent with food poisoning. Admittedly she had just gotten back a 45 days ago from a trip to a 3rd world country where she got (and recovered from) a tropical disease so her immune system is not at it's strongest right now, but come on. This shouldn't be the end result. Plus this IS downtown Phoenix so there are plenty of people around with compromised immune systems, if you know what I mean, due to lifestyle choices.There is some great Asian food in Central Phoenix. Maxim and Da Vang are great Vietnamese places on 19th ave.The Cultural Center has a few great places, esp Golden Buddha. Thai Lahna has been consistently good for years.Like I said I don't eat a lot of chain food - but even the Pei Wei at 7th ave and McDowell is way better in terms of food quality.

"I haven't yelped in about 2 months, and I was waiting for a place to either wow me or disgust me.  Well, this place was that bad. First impressions were all right -- the outside bar was neat w good views of downtown, and the fire pits were nice.  No beers on tap though; and seriously, what's with the hip-hop club DJ at 7:00 pm  Come on guys, way too early for that.It wasn't too long before three of us were seated; and after about 10 minutes, our waitress came up and asked us whether we were ready to ... oh wait, that's right, no menus yet, good job.  O.k., so I ordered the Thai Spring rolls, which had a filling of lettuce, a single strip of carrot, and noodles.  Seriously!  Main course, I ordered the curry, which turned out to be the worst curry in the world -- I don't even know if it was curry; it was more like a bowl of thick, yellow soup, with a few pieces of chicken and a couple of vegetables tossed in.  Yuck.  And then they only gave me a tiny bowl of rice.  I'm sorry, isn't it supposed to be the other way around  My friends completely agreed with how bad the place was (I think they had some sort of stir fry, which they said was bland and pointless).So yeah, I don't recommend this place.  Instead, head a block over to The Roosevelt for some good beer on tap and some pretty good food.

"I hate Fate!  My fate at Fate has always been to have a mediocre meal that takes too long.  Don't even bother with a group as it only makes the servers even more surly than normal and the food even slower to arrive.The last time I was there, I was with a group (bad idea, per my comment above).  Several folks asked that their food be prepared mild.  When the food came, every dish on the table was nuclear hot.  I can handle hot food, but this was on par with Los Dos Molinos.  When we mentioned this to our server, she told us that it all has to do with the peppers they have on hand at any given time.  She patiently explained that the heat levels of the peppers vary (Duh!), but the chef always uses the same amount of pepper and never tastes the food.  Therefore, the heat level varies wildly and there is no consistency.  Frankly, any chef who doesn't taste their food needs to get out of the kitchen and into another line of work.The concept of the menu with the various preparations and the choice of proteins is great.  Sadly, Fate falls apart in its execution.It's a lot less flashy, but you get a consistent meal at China Chili where they also know how to regulate the heat in their food.  Apparently their chefs actually taste their dishes.

"First of all, Johnny Chu should be ashamed to call himself a chef. He is barely a line cook. As stated in previous reviews, he doesn't even taste his own food (which accounts for the wide margin of variety a single dish may have on two different visits).So, I made reservations, thinking I may be able to sit at the bar because I arrived 10 minutes early. Wrong. I was ordered to wait outside. Nearly 45 minutes later, and a drink at the bar next door, I inquired about my table. The girl didn't even look up at me to acknowledge I had said anything. After a minute or so of staring at her while she continued to ignore me, she finally said my table was ready. Hmm.The food is horrible. I fear those of you who enjoy it, rather enjoy the ""atmosphere"" and come here to be seen. The food is either completely bland (e.g., my curry, which tasted of water with a slight hint of something I couldn't even recognize) or so hot as to mask any possible flavor. By calling themselves ""authentic Asian"" cuisine is just silly. There are so many hole-in-the-wall Asian restaurants that could cook Chu under the table blindfolded.So, the rude, nonexistent service, the insanely overpriced food, and to be seen is what you're paying for. If you enjoy being treated like shit and fed food that I wouldn't feed in a troth for pigs--you may enjoy this place and good for you!

"I took two of my friends there who are here in Phoenix the first time and the service was terrible.  The noodles and other dishes were good as usual, but the service we received from the guy was otherwise.That guy talked very fast which didn't bother me as much until he started forgetting our requests.  He stopped by to check if we needed to refill the green tea in couple of occassions but never did it until in much later time.  When we asked to split the bills in two in certain way, it had to be done three times.  It just gave me the impression that he didn't really pay attention to what we wanted.This is the first time I went back since last year (rated 45 previously).  Hopefully he will improve his service and attitude or else they will lose more customers.

"The food is average to slightly above average. That isn't what is wrong with Cherry Blossom.The problem with Cherry Blossom is the service which seems to be getting worse. I have taken my family there at least a dozen times and it appears as if the service which was so-so to begin with has deteriorated to just plain incompetent. Today was the final straw. My wife and I arrived there at 11:35 am for an early lunch and while the place was not empty, it was not packed either. We were seated immediately in the back room which was empty when we arrived. The server promptly took our drink order and brought it to us. She said she'd give us a few minutes to look over the menu. A few minutes went by, then another few minutes, then another and by 11:57, our order had still not been taken. At that point, my wife flagged down the host who took our order. I should point out that both my wife and I had ordered two simple lunch items from the menu without any substitutions or special requests. Two minutes later (around 11:59) our server appeared and asked if we had decided what we wanted. After informing her that we just gave our order to the host, she vanished. Both our orders were supposed to come with soup and salad and still by 12:14, neither had arrived. At that point, more people had arrived and the several tables in the back room where we were had become occupied. We also noticed that these customers, who arrived well after we had, had been served their salads, soups and even their meals while we sat there waiting. At that point I went to speak with the host about where our missing salads and soups were and she smiled politely but did not respond. My wife and I decided we were not going to pay for such incompetent service and just walked out. The last time I was there, the service was slow and they did not bring one of the salads for one of the meals we ordered. Other times we have gone there and waited 10 minutes to even be asked for our drink order when the place was not even half full. It just seems to get worse and worse at Cherry Blossom.So in conclusion. If you enjoy sitting and waiting while watching other customers who walked in 10 or 15 minutes or more after you did get their orders taken and served their food, this is the place for you. It is my belief that management is to blame for Cherry Blossom's poor service. Fortunately, I can take my money and spend it elsewhere and that's just what we did after we left. Cherry Blossom will not be getting any more visits from us.

"This place made me wanna start a bad-food-diet! Ok. Maybe I should start a little more positive.This place has decent ambience. That's about it. The restaurant staff that I encountered was non-friendly, non-welcomy, and probably non-existent!The biggest offense is the food! I cannot believe so many other reviews were soooo positive. I came in a little late (9:15 p.m.) and that may have rubbed the waiting staff wrong, but there were 2 other parties that came in after me.Going back to the food. I ordered Miso Ramen and an addition of cha-shu (pork), and a side of Agedashi Tofu. 1. The Miso ramen came with a slice of salmon.  Really Salmon It was not the best combination to say the least. Miso There was hardly any miso in the soup. It was so diluted, I almost had to imagine the taste of miso. BTW, the cha-shu was like left-over and an after-thought added to the ramen. I am guessing the owner is trying to pull a fast one.  2. Agedashi Tofu. This is a freaking joke. An insult to the patron of the restaurant. Really!! How lazy can this restaurant get! Essentially a silken tofu deep fried with some dashi-based sauce. What did I get A re-fried chinese firm tofu which was probably microwaved with a bunch of undercook or recooked vegetable tempura. The sauce Dilluted straight from the bottle tempura sauce!3. Iced Green Tea. This one is not as bad as some other Asian fusion restaurant. They actually used a decent roasted green tea with a hint of roast barley.  Unfortunately, it is so very dilluted.  The guy from the next table was complaining that he was drinking water!I also saw something not very nice; a waiter recycling butter from a table.  I know it is sealed but, really in front of customersThis place really cut corners in terms of food and service. Benefit of doubt Maybe, since I tried this place only once, but once is enough for me. I saw 2 sushi rolls ordered by a couple that came in after myself. Not impressed at all.Bottom-line, lazy effort at best. Worst case scenario, cheap food costing big bucks giving patrons food-poisoning from re-using left-overs!

The fried pork was so over cooked I couldn't chew it. The cold noodles were indeed cold, as they tasted like they were cooked 3 days ago and stored in the fridge. And the miso soup Me so wished it was good, as I was starving when I left.

"The good: Nice ambiance, friendly service. I was trying to find a good ramen place (so spoiled by Orenchi in the bay area... that's the golden standard). Walked in and saw some Asian people so thought it was a good sign. The bad: Ordered chicken karage and ramen - chicken karage looked straight outta the freezer section at your local supermarket! If you haven't had good chicken karage, it's fried (chicken, duh) with a batter similar to tempura (lighter than traditional American batters). Nope, this was your standard frozen, then warmed chicken with a rubbery-coating-that-passes-as-real-fried-food. If I wanted frozen food, I would have just made it myself (no I wouldn't, that shit tastes terrible). The sauce was uninspiring, but hey, does it matter if the chicken isn't worth it The ugly:  The ramen I ordered came out... and disappointment abounds. First, the noodles looked like what you buy at the supermarket. So... yeah, if I want supermarket food, I'll just go to the supermarket. Am I wrong to expect restaurants to actually prepare food from scratch Oh but it's so hard to make noodles by handmachine you say THAT'S WHY I SPEND MONEY IN A RESTAURANT!!!!What about the broth The life-sustaining broth that is cooked for hours if not days and ties the entire dish together ... well let's not get too excited because once again, it tastes more like powdered mix. Are we sensing a theme here Lots of supermarket stuff, at a premium price. Sorry, that's not why I go to a restaurant.So why did I even bother trying this place Because Yelp had promised me a grand culinary experience (okay maybe not grand, but good at least). This was really sub-par at best; the nicest servers or prettiest backdrop cannot make up for low-quality food. But I am a temporary tourist in Phoenix (4 months for work, normally in SF), so take my ran with a grain of salt. Maybe all that big city living has made me a (ramen) snob; YMMV

"This was one of the few times Yelp has led us wrong. Came here because it was close by & had 4 stars. I will say the service was perfectly fine. Our server was very friendly & even though it was busy, we were greeted at the door & sat quickly. Unfortunately, it was downhill from the point we got our food. We ordered an assortment of rolls & a dish of pad Thai. The sushi choices almost all include cream cheese &or tempura, which made it difficult to choose a variety without everything tasting similar.The sushi all tasted fishy. I don't think it was unfresh, but it certainly didn't taste fresh either. It was somewhere in between the two...if that is possible. The presentation wasn't bad either, but the overall experience was tainted by the poor tasting sushi.

"You would think their exorbitant prices would at least buy some decent customer service. Not at this location. They are totally understaffed and have almost nobody able or willing to help you find anything. This is a problem because they carry so many completely different products that it's hard to find what you need. Expect to wait at least a half hour before getting assistance.The organization is disjointed, especially depending on your project. There's even a section called ""art supplies"". I thought that was kind of the point of the whole store. What did it in however was how miserably they packed my picture frames. The place next door wrapped two dollar drinking glasses in paper to protect them, but apparently Michael's thinks a grocery bag is sufficient to protect a nice picture frame in bad weather. So, the inevitable happened and I dropped the bag. Now I don't expect every place to be sympathetic, even though it could have been packed better, but when I asked for a refund they were down right RUDE. Hey I did drop the thing, but some empathy would have been nice. I wasn't completely out of line asking because a little bubble wrap and it would have been fine in the first place. I will never be back to this or any other Michael's.

"Of the Michaels in Charlotte this one is probably the one I like the least.  The store always looks terrible, but that is partially due to it being an older store.  The other reason the store looks so terrible is because its a mess (empty and disorganized shelves)!  I'm not sure if this store is physically smaller than the other Michaels in the area, but it definitely lacks selection.  Lastly, our cashier wasn't friendly and seemed like she was being in convinced by having to ring up customers.  For these reasons I generally go to Hobby Lobby or wait until I'm on the other side of Charlotte to go to a different Michaels.

Customer service that is apathetic at best, rude at worst. Today, for example, my (sadly, regular) cashier forgets, twice, whether I want a bag. her apology ""Sorry. I just don't care much today."" No eye contact, no smile. This is typical of the service.2. Three times the last month the item price that rang up was different from that listed on the shelf. I wasn't too bothered, as it rang up clearance price. When I mentioned to the cashier the clearance price was not the price listed on the shelf, she replied, ""oh,"" and stared at me blankly.Fortunately Michael's Craft Supplies on the eastside is starting to carry more yarn and sewing items, which means I can stop the tortured visits to Jo-Ann Fabrics someday soon.

Just being honest but the bad outweighs the good at this club, give it a shot at your own risk but remember I warned you.

"Went here yesterday to see the drag show with my friend (and fellow transperson) Fenyx.Cruisin had everything I would ever want out of a bar; seedy atmosphere, cheap drinks, a stage, friendly bartenders, and trannies, crossdressers, and drag queens as far as the eye could see. For a moment I felt how Robert Smith must feel whenever he walks into a Hot Topic, or Hulk Hogan in a bandana wholesaler's. But alas, like Torrid and Guitar Center, I inevitably showed up the same day as the token asshole employee whose brief interaction with me would ruin my view of this establishment for all time.While waiting for the show to commence, Fenyx and I went through the back door to take a smoke break, as were a lot of other people. The back door couldn't be shut all the way or it would lock, forcing you to either bang on it until someone heard you over the music or walk around to the other side. So he and I are just standing around, smoking, talking, making sure nobody shuts the door, and out comes the DJ. He steps out, and before even lighting his cigarette, slams the door behind him.""Awwww, man, now you've locked us out,"" we say, playfully.The DJ stands over Fenyx, eyeballing him as he responds with ""Yeah, that's the point. To keep the undesirables out"" before walking off with his cigarette.""What the hell just happened"" I ask.""He thinks we're a straight couple."" I laughed. I searched for a pen. I'd been mistaken for a lot of things in the past, but this was the first time I'd been mistaken as straight. This had to be documented. Fenyx, who is also not straight, was not as amused.I tried to brush the comment aside and we went back inside, where the DJ proceeded to stare down my amigo and I from across the bar. I knew at any moment, a confrontation would escalate, and I was forced to choose between leaving early, missing the drag show, or watch the tension rise to eruption. One of these scenarios carried with it the slight risk of me breaking a newly manicured nail, so naturally, I opted we go back to the Bunkhouse and play darts.I'm sure giving them 1 star for this one incident is petty, but, uh, so is what they did, so it works out, I guess.Oh well. Torrid and Guitar Center seem to do just fine without my business. I'm sure Cruisin 7th will do just fine.

"What an absolute dive, and not in a good way. The day I was so lucky to have gone there was a show of some kind with twinks bouncing all around on the stage with small briefs on, not attractive at all.  Now when entering it be prepared, it reaks of BO, sewer and garbage. I had to push my way through just to get past the entrance, once standing there trying to get my surrounding's, I'm pushed and bumped into as if I am not there. I cannot stand packed places, especially with shirtless, sweaty, smelly guys rubbing into me...yuck. I be-lined it for the patio for escape and stayed there until my friends were ready to leave. Just a awkward mix of very ""interesting ""people, not the most nice to look at, or trust to leave your drink for any amount of time. It's definitely not worth the olfactory assault to ever go in there again.
",0
"Although there is lots of fun to be had here- the atmosphere of the show does not make up for the lack of cleanliness and overall ""ICK"" factor.  I love me some dive bars, but this one was a little too subterranean.  That and please, ladies- when you are lip syncing, at least know HALF of the words to the song.  Just moving your mouth and jaw like an automaton is NOT fun or attractive.

"I went here once for a drag king Contest. All the women were very over weight and not very entertaining. The bar itself is the size of a shack and it is definetly for an older male crowd.If you are a lesbian between the ages of 21-35 this is not your spot

"Never again. A few years back I was treated with horrible service. We approached the owner about it and he treated us like crap too. Boycotted this bar for 2 years and tried it again. once again they prove to be a-holes. There are plenty of Friendly bars that will appreciate the business.

"Very upset at this place,  I'm outside in the beer garden having a cigarette when the owner came up to me and said that I smell pot on my person. I told him that I was a medical patient and that I medicated before I got to the bar.  He told me not to smoke in the parking lot.  I told him I haven't,  that I know the laws. Then he accused me of smoking in the parking lot.  I really feel discriminated here and I will not come back.  Even when u respect their rules, they feel they can just discriminate u and call u out in front of everyone. Definitely will not be coming back

"Apollo's was a fun experience, until I checked my bank account and find the erroneously overcharged me over $35.00. When I called they tried to tell me it was a debit ""hold"" for tip. It was not. This was a week later and the charge went through. They said they would have someone call me back. They did not. I got the run around and they gave themselves a very generous tip at my expense. Have fun, but check your bank account, they don't play by the rules.

"I was raised Catholic (but no longer practice), and have always been fascinated by relics and the stories of saints--so I was really looking forward to our tour of St Anthony's. BEWARE: I can't speak for their other guides, but the gentleman (a lay person, not a priest) who ""led"" ours was far more interested in haranguing the crowd on the nature of TRUE believers, the infallibility of the Catholic faith, and whether we'd all found our ""charisms"" - the gifts we needed to be using if we were going to be saints, too--than showing us any relics. After an hour of his sermon--and nary a single fact about the hundreds of relics that surrounded us--we left. What a disappointment. What a huckster.

"If you plan on getting married here please ask them what their rules are regarding wedding photography and videography before you book.  They have very strict rules here and your hired professionals will have severe limitations on where they can be and what they can do.Unfortunately I see this kind of thing all too often and the church's reason being that they want to ""preserve the sanctity of the ceremony and the religion.""  Meanwhile guests are taking video and photos with their smart devices.  If churches, like this one, wanted to preserve the sanctity of the ceremony than their rules should apply to all, not just the people hired by the couple to be there.

"This place is less than honest. We turned up on a Saturday evening at 7 pm,  we were the only customer, afterwards, there were three more when we left. We ordered the dish ""meat lover"" for the hungry  at 39.95-, which was supposed to include prime rib eye, Kobe chuck and Kobe rib eye"". To our surprise, a waiter came up silently with a plate that has one row of meat  undistinguished of any kind, Kobe or not, it all looks alike  . next, it was worse when we tasted it, it was less than fresh, and for a hungry meat lover, it was a real bad experience that mad us run away. We then tried to stop by Monday at lunch time, to make our complaint, the manager duly took note and said he would review the camera in the kitchen and contact us, alas, we never heard of him again, so we assumed the the camera did not lie!!!!

"So far, every restaurant i've tried in this plaza (just two lol...) have not been that great. The restaurant was completely empty at 12 pm...only one waitress working and a couple customers went into the restaurant after us and she seemed quite frantic. Took a while for the food...a tiny plate of veggies with broth that tasted weird. Ponzu sauce had a strange taste to it. Meat still looked frozen and was not great at all...miso had a weird sour taste. Overall, I didn't like it. Sesame sauce was good, but I probably won't come here again...

"Since I was in Vegas for edc weekend one of my friend suggest us to try the shabu restaurant. He had stated thats the only time he will ever eat shabu since he's not a big of a fan of shabu as I am. So as we get there I was like okay there's cars so were going to have to wait, as soon as I walked in there was only one couple in there *awkward cricket noise* I could've sworn this restaurant was super good and worth it by what my friend had said. Anywho, walked in sat down I was excited to try the ponzu & goma sauce the prices for the meat was decent but what I didn't like about it was that it did not taste fresh. The meat tasted & looked like it was bought from a grocery place and then they just placed it really quick onto the plate and made it look nice. The goma sauce was so sweet and the texture of it sucked I tried to add in as much items as I can to take the sweetness away, seemed like they bought that from a grocery store also. The ponzu was okay not bad thats probably the best thing there ... As I got down to making my soup I asked the waitress for soup base but guess what nope they dont have soup base what the f ..  seriously she didnt even supply us with the right tools to get our noodles with [thats no big deal cause either way I know how to use chopsticks] but when she brought us our bowls that just made me not want to be there anymore.. these bowls they brought to us are the bowls that is the smallest one how the hell are you suppose to enjoy your udon in that small ass bowl! really .. I was just glad to leave .. NEVER AGAIN will I go to the shabu in Vegas.If you want real shabu that will definitely not disappoint you, if you're in orange county eat at shabu bar I guarantee you will not be disappointed  in the service, drinks, food, & the awesome workers there.

"Shabu shabu in Vegas....yes please!  I was in the mood for shabu while in Vegas and came upon this location based on the great reviews.Those giving this place high marks are outta their minds and havn't eaten at a true shabu place.  Nothing to rave about here.... Place was empty, I should have known.Thinking of eating shabu in Vegas... Skip this location.Oh Korean garlic chicken... Your better off eating chicken nuggets at McDonald's.
",0
"I am not quite sure what is wrong with all the people on this site giving this Restaurant high marks. I went based upon those and was extremely disappointed.  This was by far and away one of the worst meals I have had in recent memory. The majority of my party felt ill afterwards. I would give it 0 stars, but Yelp doesn't allow that.

"I love Shabu Shabu, and have been going to the Shabu Shabu in Henderson (I won't name to be fair) for a long time. We decided to try this place, Swish, to get something a little different. In the end, we were extremely disappointed and wish we could recommend it, but just can not. Decor and ambiance are OK. Waitress was nice. Peach tea was good. Prices fair.The major problem was the food. We ordered chicken and beef with shabu shabu and sukiyaki. Firstly, the sukiyaki and dipping sauces were way too salty and just not appealingly flavored. Secondly, the chicken was in chunks, not sliced, and had all sorts of cartilage and chewy bits. The chunks wouldn't cook because they were too thick.. The chicken was completely inappropriate and also tasted bad because it was served marinated in some sort of sauce that neither of us liked. I just couldn't eat the chicken at all. My companion ate it just so we wouldn't waste it, but he didn't like it either. The beef was ok, and sliced appropriately, and I ate that in the shabu shabu, but without a good dipping sauce was ultimately just disappointing. I like cabbage, but they served way too much of it and not nearly enough of the other vegetables or tofu or noodles.The minor problem was the hot pots. They were extremely shallow, and the waitress didn't pay attention to them, so they were constantly boiling down, and at multiple points were down to almost nothing, so we couldn't cook our food.I left hungry, and sad.
",0
"I was not impressed. I have to agree with the 1 or 2 star review where someone said whoever is giving this place good ratings has not had real shabu shabu.The place was plain. The first thing I noticed when we sat down was that they had condiment settings that are normally used for things like chili sauce filled with what looked like grated ginger or garlic, scallions, and onions. I said to my boyfriend that these could've been sitting out all day. I glanced at a table to the left of the bar and there were a bunch of these condiment sets sitting there, probably never used since they took 'em out of the fridge because no one comes here (it was pretty dead). Hmm.Next, I was looking at their menu and I was fairly disappointed. Everything just seemed to cost so much more than it should've. When the waitress came to take our order, my boyfriend told her what we wanted, but she turned to me and asked what I wanted. My boyfriend was like, ""We're going to share."" I started to wonder if the portions were supposed to be for each person. If so, then I felt like everything was overpriced. When we got the food, we were able to share it just fine (though my boyfriend ate most of it and I am hungry now, a few hours later). At the end of the meal, I still felt like we overpaid. Our meal was $23. If we hadn't split what the waitress implied was supposed to be a meal for a single person, then it would've been too much, imo. We just had hot pot at this great place in Rowland Heights, CA (called Kingswood Teppan Steak House, if you're ever in the area) and we had way more food and broth (two kinds, too) for $32. We had two different kinds of broth, four ingredients (chicken, beef, mushrooms, vegetables), and there was fried rice for each of us. Since it seems we split a single meal, we only got one bowl of white rice. The $9 difference would've only gotten us... I think probably just the side of chicken (it was like $6.95 or something) and we would have a couple bucks leftover that wouldn't have paid for anything else. I wasn't happy with the prices.As I mentioned before, it was pretty dead when we got there. After finishing our meal and reading the reviews, I was not surprised. I've had hot pot before, but this is my first time having it in Las Vegas. I'm hoping better places exist. I may just have to start having hot pot at home when I get cravings.I can't recommend this place nor do I ever plan on coming back.

"I got pumped up by all the hype when I first heard of the new craze that is Shabu Shabu.  To all the fans, I'm sorry to say.. but I think Swish Shabu Shabu was a FAIL!  Swish did not live up to all its Swash.  We ordered numerous items on the menu from small portions of seafood and the kobe.  The amount of food that you get for the price was not worth it.  Also, am I the only one here that thinks the broth, especially the sukiyaki was bland to the bone!  We dumped in a dribble of soy sauce, gave it a few shakes of pepper, stirred up some magic juju in hopes to re-engineer the flavor, buy no luck there.  The whole dining experience as a first timer was an ultimate downer.  I didn't finish first with this one, I guess I'm just not a Shabu kinda' guy..

"What happened to this place It used to be so good. I opted for the Prime Chuck, and it was so thick, tough and chewy. Their beef used to be really good.Service was not great. Never checked up on me, as I didn't have enough water to finish cooking my beef. Sadly disappointed.

"Warning: When paying w a credit card they will ADD a tip to you on the iphone and show you just a signing screen. Sometimes they will even sign for it themselves. Happened to multiple people, if you're willing to come here even despite this review, PLEASE pay w cash or check with extreme caution of what they're trying to charge you. They will email you a receipt so that that will give them adequate time to get away with it, and deny assistance when you try to dispute it.Service: The service is poor, inconsistent. They forgot our order, didn't pay any attention to what was being requested and ignored everybody us for the most part. We got our food late, the vegetables early, the meat at least 30 mins later (my friend got their meat 45 mins later). The meat was, even the expensive stuff, was less than mediocre. Atmosphere: The place had an odor to it that would make you sick after sitting in it for a while. It should have been a sign when you go into a shabu shabu house and you see the only clientele there to be over weight non-asian people. not to say that you need to be a skinny asian to enjoy shabu shabu, but every good shabu shabu place I ever seen had a bunch of skinny asian people in it.Conclusion: Do not come here, if you do anyways, make sure they dont over charge you for service they did not do.

"Had I known this was an AYCE ONLY place, I would not have went there.  It started off good, the menu and rules were explained, we were showed how to tableside cook some items.  I don't eat very much food and quite frankly the only think I actually enjoyed was their lemonade.  My wife placed an order of dishes that would be prepared in the kitchen.  The first item as an eggplant dish.  It never arrived and we kept asking for it and some lamb chops.  We were presented with our bill instead.  Finally 1 lamb chop arrived and we still had to ask again for the eggplant dish.  When the eggplant dish finally arrived, it had the most nasty old grease smell that I almost lost my dinner from the smell.  My wife took one bite and passed.  We tipped our standard $1 for bad service on our $50 meal.  Oh yea, that AYCE price might be less than $20, but it does not include drinks.  At least I got a refill of the lemonade, the only thing I enjoyed.  If you like AYCE places, this might be your thing.  My wife liked the lamb chop (I was way full before it finally arrived), but the focus of this place is to cook it yourself, and get you out the door as fast as you can.

"Yea. This place is a place I wish I had never tried. Tried this when they first opened with a friend of mine from out of town. Meat quality was subpar esp for the price of the place. I cannot see how this place has as many stars as it does. My guess is that they have not been to a quality shabu spot. I bet I can go to a better place and pay about the same amount with meat that is way better than here. I've been around a lot of butchered meat and the meat here is not good. I wouldn't even try their pork or chicken here by looking at their quality of beef.

"I'm only giving this place a 1-star because there is no zero-star option. The whole place is a disorganized mess. It's riddled with building code and health code violations. For example, they have camping stoves on the tables but no exhaust hoods to ventilate the room. They have exposed outlets. The place is a wreck. The food was decent, but stay away from the blue crab, unless you bring your own claw crackers. They don't have them. No one comes to bus your table. The one point, they left a bussers tub on the floor by our table, which we used to dispose of our used dishes. Oh, and if you order appetizers, be sure to savor them... an hour into your meal, that is.

"So our first visit here was the best. The server was helpful and explained how to work the hot pot. They had showed us how to make different sauces and flavors for the broth. Now the second go around our server didn't explain the new menu nor did he know what an Arnold palmer was. He only explained that he was having a bad day since the Chargers lost. He seems lost and unsure of the menu. Then said we had the option to do the lunch or dinner menu. Stating lunch menu did not include appetizers and the dinner menu includes 4 appetizers each. We wanted to do lunch because we only wanted two appetizers. He said OK then a moment later came back and said we could only do the dinner option. He rarely check on us and looked high. Totally upset that we wasted $40 on broth that tasted bland and possibly old. The high light of our meal...my water. The appetizers were actually better then I expected. They were the 2nd highlight of our meal. Maybe we just got a bad server. Whatever the case. Not satisfied. Should have went to Yama Sushi like we planned.

"I was extremely disappointed with this restaurant. My friend told me about it. I got there and this guy who seemed like he did not what he was doing helped Me told him it was my first time . He was so busy and did not explain anything. I was so hungry so i. Proceeded to get Food. There was a fridge with all this shabu ingredients , it was ok. The bad part was it was supposed to be all you eat  but then they gave me a menu that said you could only order 4 items ,i was surprised but i looked at the pictures and saw cute little appetizer things i ordered  4 items. When it came i was really shocked the things that came did not resemble the pictures and instead of three pieces i got two pieces  . Please if you are providing visual references  please make it similar to what you are going to give me. So I could at least  identify what i ordered. i was so frustrated now because I waited for a long time for my orders. It was hailing a taxi cab  in New York you have to chase the servers so i never got to see my waiters it was always someone new ,people were waiting to pay and it was taking a long time. Well I said i am just  going to have dessert i heard of the mango and sticky rice in a lot of the reviews and i was excited  because it was the only thing i could look forward for at this point. Guess what  when i asked about it the waitress told me my only choices were green tea ice cream and another thing that i didn't even understand.Im sorry but that was it. I paid and let and went to another place to get my dessert . i am not coming back!!!!!!!

"Are you kidding me Worst dining experience, ever. I had high expectations for this place. First off, the hostess was rude. She asked if we had been there before, but took awhile for her to explain how everything is self-served (which, by the way, was disgusting how all the meat and seafood is just openly exposed in the same nasty refrigerator for who knows how long). The plates were dirty and some of the meat we chose from the fridge was literally sticking onto the plate. No one even asked if we wanted anything to drink. We had to get up ask for water. It took 25 minutes to get our appetizers and the quality of the food was just horrible. I had spit out the clams because it tasted old and bad. I feel like I'm about to get sick. I left unhappy, unsatisfied and still hungry!

"First time coming here and my last time. The service sucked big time, very little instructions on where anything is. The food area looks like a health code violation, the plates and sliverware still had left over food. .. overall this place seems like its been open for years and everything is grimy and gross, the broth has no flavor, taste like boiling water. Was it worth the 22.00, nope... Will I come back Nope I am afraid I might get food poisoning

"Diners beware!  Apparently the lunch AYCE price does not apply on the weekends.  Went to lunch there today and assumed the weekday lunch price. Nowhere in the restaurant nor did our host notify us the price on the weekends were the dinner price.  Imagine my surprise when I got the check!  I asked the host where does it say dinner price on weekends  She feigned not being able to understand English all of the sudden and said it's a new thing they just enacted.

"Have tried to eat here twice for their advertised lunch special.  Went on a Sunday, as banner outside did not specify days, told it was Sunday Brumch only. Tried again and even called to make sure they were offering the lunch special on a Saturday and was told yes on the phone. Drove 15 mins out our way and are told when we walk in that there is no lunch special. Given line of excuses that person was new that had answered phone, no ""we will honor what our employee said"" line, or offer to get manager. Plus the chalkboard with lunch specials is out on display next to counter inside even. Will not waste my time with this place again due to constant bad employee communicationcustomer service.

"I went today at 5pm, and there was no indication that it was closed as the sign said open on Tues-Sun until 10:30pm. I came in with a group of 4 others and one man greeted us and asked us how big was our party. We replied 5 and he said he was ""the only worker there"" and ""we were too big for him"". He looked extremely confused as to why we showed up and the rest of the place was empty. He didn't explain to us if there were workers that were supposed to show up, or if we would expect abnormally long wait times, or if today was an anomaly because of the snow. He basically just turned us away. We wanted hotpot so it literally requires him to turn on a burner and slice meat. He doesn't even have to cook. What is the point of leaving the restaurant open, or even running a restaurant if you don't adhere to your hours of opening. Genuinely confused at how and when to eat at this place.

"Worst service ever!! Went here for a family dinner and waited more than 30 minutes for our food which didn't come all at once. We were told that rice came with our entrees, but the rice never came. After 10 more minutes, I asked about the rice, and they said they had to cook more. At this point everyone in the whole restaurant (small place) had been eating for 20 minutes with no new orders. It was apparent that they forgot to make more (hard to imagine in an asian restaurant). I did ask how this was possible and was told they gave it to the carryout order that just happened (we were here first). I have now been waiting for an hour as I decided to type this review for an awful dinner. The candle in our hot pot has already burned out while waiting! Unbelievable!!!

"I was soo damn excited to try this place, being really close by, and being raised on authentic ChineseHong Kong hot pot in LA and HI. I read all the reviews, got excited, and went. :( I hate to give low scores, but this is based off of my total experince. They get one less star because of lack of correct business information posted here as far as business hours, and BBQ hours. They also seriously need a website. This is an aweful business practice, and they could be making some serious improvements. Businesses need to be on top of these basic and fundamental things!! WthWell, fist off, on yelp, it says they are open at 11am. Nope. When I arrived excitedly, sign says 5-2am. Ok. No prob. Ill come back!Next day I go back, yayyy! Upon entering, I am bombarded by loud and obnoxious techno that keeps reapeating itself. Other than that, the decor was cute, and as everyone described here. The techno music put me on edge lol. I could not relax to enjoy my experience. With a few tables filled, did the music need to be so loudOn to the menu and service...We had originally come to try this famous rice ball everyones been talking about, and possibly get some little vegetarian BBQ sides, similar to yakitori. When I mentioned the word ""yakitori"", the waitress dressed in Japanese garb was like ""what u say""... ok right, this is Chinese owned ChineseHong Kong restaurant... she was nice. She priceeds to tell me that the BBQ menu is only avail Thurs - Sat. What! You guys seriously need to update your yelp info!! I already missed eating here once cause your hours are posted wrong, and now I sat there unable to try what I came here for! :(In my observation service was not very efficient or quick. Service was slow as I observed in general. It was not busy, so I couldint understand why our server was not more attendant.We had ordered a sake bomb to share, and no second cup was brought out... had to ask.The food itself was great. I always order vegetarian things, so I was happy there were an item here and there was. I had a terrific eggplant dish that itself deserves 5 stars. We also shared the tomato vegetarian hot pot. Lighter in flavor than others I've had in my life, it was still yummy. It said there was supposed to be lotus root in there. When I told my server there was none, she was like ""oh really Sorry."" Nothing to correct the situation. We shared it. Its made for one. And it comes with a choice of two dipping sauces... they sucked. See in LA, you get all these sauces at the table for FREE and they are authentic and damn good. I could tell they Americanized the dipping sauces here. :(Over all, slightly dissaponted. And just wish AZ had a really bomb and authentic hot pot experience. Hong Kong hot pot that im used to feeds four cause the pots so damn huge, and its like $15-$20. For one pot here its $10 +. :(We were finished with our meal for a good 10 min, and began to gather our things before she noticed to give us our check. Where did our free ice cream go that everyone was raving about We did not get any. :(I see where everyones been confused about this place. Its Japanese decored, but Hong Kong style food. Maybe they should consider changing the theme to stop the confusion lol.I will give it a try again, just to get my asian food fix nearby. But I hope for better dining experiences.

"Very disappointed...I had my usual Dirty martini, but a friend wanted just a soda since she was driving....Do you know what they charged...$4.00!!  For a soda!  And it was in the smallest glass!  Come on....With DUI laws that we have here in Scottsdale and the economy crisis that we are in,  $4.00 for a soda is a bit much when it is cheaper at Target to get a case!  ($3.50) I am not cheap by any stretch, but I think it is a bit absurd to over inflate the price of a soda!  Don't go to Stone Rose if you are looking for a drink deal!

Not good.The bar is self is a bit crap - its atmosphere is like walking in on your parents doing it, has no charm but attempts to cover these major flaws with tacky bling and various other furnishings.Avoid if you value your morals.

"$14.75 for one well rum & coke not including tip...I don't freaking think so ever again.. plus, I had to send my boyfriend to get me my drink since NO ONE ever came to our table ever. Oh wait I take that back, the cocktail server did stop by to say where closing now.

"I was not happy one bit here.  Earlier that night my girlfriend and I were waiting to meet up with a mutual friend at the Palazzo.  We first went to the Zebra lounge for a while to wait but the lounge was closing and one the hosts said that since they were closing they recommended the Laguna.  We went and only found one table open which that empty glasses from who ever was sitting there before.  We sat down, and stayed there until sometime past 2am (when the lights went on and the music stopped) and still those glasses were still there.  I think were were here for at least a good hour and none of the waitress ever stopped by to ask for a drink.  I went to the Bar as there were 3 bartenders one was serving drinks, the other cleaning some glasses and the last one I have no idea what was doing.I walked to the first guy, and as soon as I approached the bar, he walked to the other side and I just there for a few minutes looking like an idiot.  I then walked to the other end, and he walked back...no I looked like a bigger idiot as he was just cleaning glasses.  The lady in the back walked away so there were only 2 of them now.  As I walked to the other Bartender there, he was serving about 10 drinks for a group of ladies that were there, and then a gentleman who was ordering a drink for him self and a buddy of his.  10 minutes later I finally order one drink (Rum & Coke) and the damage was $15 which anywhere else in Vagas would be about $5 (and if that was not bad enough...I still left a tip).  I finally came back to our table and those glasses from the previous customers were still there.  My girlfriend asked ""what took so long"" as she though I just left her there.I don't see myself going back here again.

"Beware of bars charging more than the bill!This is the 2nd time this has happened in this property. I know its the strip and am willing to pay extra for drinks so when I ordered 4 Jameson gingers and it came out to 60 bucks I had no issues. However, sorry im standing at a bar and it took you 30 seconds to pour the 4 drinks, im not going to tip 20%. I signed the check and left a 5 dollar tip (I usually tip a dollar per drink at a bar) and today I see a charge on my debit card for 72 dollars....... First time this happened was at a bar by the pool a few months ago. take pictures of the check you signed people because they are dishonest at the palazzo

"Truly the worst bar in Las Vegas. I'm a regular guest at the hotel and have never experienced such rude service. Carrsten is not only incredibly arrogant, but also implied that I looked like a hooker because I was alone. Please understand that I was in a knee length black dress without cleavage or skin tight material. I only tried to make polite conversation because I'd met so many great people on this trip. I never knew being a single successful woman who can pay for things herself was so offensive. None of the staff are friendly so I guess he fits right in.

"Thbbbbb. Thumbs down. It's places like this that give Scottsdale a bad name.  I must divulge that I'm not basing this rating on an actual review of the club, because they never let me and my friend in. The door man readily let all of our female friends in, and stopped us. The men in my group were a minority, two men with six ladies. The ladies in the front of our group entered with their momentum, and the last two stayed with us. A steady stream of flesh baring ladies entered one after the other beside us. We explained that we were with a group (admittedly, trying to work the fact that we were with women to our advantage) and the velvet rope boy demeaningly stated that ""every guy out here is with 'lots of women.'"" I never want to use my girlfriends as currency!We went next door, all of our girlfriends left Narcisse and joined us, and I'll never go back!Ugh! Totally gross. I just moved to town and this place appears to epitomise all of the materialistic things about which I'd been forewarned regarding Snottsdale.What do you expect with a bar called ""Narcisse""I'll add: in the 12 hr or so my girlfriends were in the bar, two of them were groped by ""manthers"", referred to in Connie's post below.Have fun!Incidentally, being new to town, I am looking for pubsclubs in greater Scottsdale and Phoenix where humans can go, with their friends.

"If i could ever put a rating of no stars I would gladly do so for this establishment. I agree with Jared T. below, this place definitely gives his town a bad name. This pseudo-LA ish & wanna be establishment is just another copy of what they hope to be, bringing in celebrities, mr. jerkoff bouncer, that ain't gonna work. Their front door staff really needs to get their heads out of their asses. Even the vegas nightclubs rarely stoop down to their level, especially on a non-holiday & rainy weekend. They're still weeding people out. seriously hahaha. Good luck with your short-run success mr. owner.I'm actually not bitter, I just feel sad that such establishments in Scottsdale still haven't completely opened up to reality. I laugh at you. lol. I'm sure there are good folks in Scottsdale, but from what my friends have encountered it just seems to me that discrimination is still alive and thriving under a cloak of modernism. If you're not from this town, just beware of the front door staff that'll come greeting you with discrimination with open arms. Unless you're a promiscuous blonde girl. lol

"This place sounded awesome, and I am always up for champagne, unfortunately I have absolutely nothing to base this review off of. My husband & I stopped in today after some shopping around 4 pm, there was only 3 other parties there. The hostess sat us on the patio, we were super excited to try some different champagnes and the weather was just perfect. We waited for 10 minutes and nobody ever came over to our table. We waited ten more minutes and still nobody. We decided to get up and leave and on our way out, absolutely nobody said anything to us. So needless to say, we won't be back and I have absolutely no idea how the drinks, food, or service is (besides completely non existent) :(

"I have never been treated so rudely as I was at Narcisse.  But let me start from the beginning.  My husband and I went there for drinks after dinner on Saturday night and at first I was shocked that they made everyone wait in line when there was clearly plenty of room inside.  Secondly, it was odd that there were two young children around age 7 or 8 working the door along side the doormen.  I assume they are the owners kids, and they were adorable kids, but the last thing I want to see at a barloungenightclub on a Saturday night are children.  BUT, I can get over that- no big deal.  Once inside I ordered one of the least expensive glasses of champagne for $10 and  I noticed later on the receipt that they charged me double for.  Again, I can get over that.  My husband and I were enjoying our night and before leaving we decided to check the patio out and walked out the side door and walked towards the entranceexit so we could leave.  As we were making our way to the exit some guy came up to me said 'This is a private party' and I had no idea why he was saying that to me- the first thing that entered my mind was 'why are you telling me that'  Then he went on to say 'This is a private party and you are going to have to leave.'  Um, what! There were no sighs or anything at all that indicated we were suddenly in a 'private' area.  We were 5 feet from the door.  As we were leaving the doorman asked us if we had a good time and we said as a matter of fact, we were quite offended that as were were simply walking around and heading to the door another patron took it upon himself to tell us to leave.  I suggested that if an area is designated as a private party that they should have it marked as such.  He said he agreed that it was very rude and that I needed to tell his boss who was 2 feet away.  So I repeated myself to who I assume is the 'head bouncer' and his response was 'well, maybe you two should leave'.  What I couldn't believe the words that were coming out of his mouth.  He clearly doesn't have a clue about customer service.  And from reading the other reviews I am certainly not the only person that was treated this way.  TERRIBLE service!!!!

"This place sucks...  It's really that simple.  The build out is decent, but the staff and bouncers are rude.  Someone needs to tell them they are in North Scottsdale, not LA.  I give it until the summer begins before they are out of business...  Sorry, but it's no tea party.

"Horrible, horrible horrible!  9 ladies for a birthday lunch, 35 minutes passed before the wine we ordered was delivered, another 30 to 45 minutes before our order was taken and then at least 45 minutes before our entrees were brought out, one plate at a time!!  The owner () came by to address our concerns and had one excuse after another as to why things went wrong.  When I told him numerous calls to reserve a table went unanswered, (calls went directly to a voice message saying they were open for lunch and dinner), he said ""we have a digital system, didn't you get directed to prompts"" (Even if I did get said prompts, who wants to make a reservation for a simple lunch the same way you are trying to have a conversation with your credit card company)  I said no, all I got was a dial tone.   I then told him  their website directed me to opentable.com to make a reservation, I went to opentable only to get a message Narcisse is no longer a member.  The owners response  ""Our problem with opentable is that we are a nightclub""  What in the world does that mean  If you are a nightclub, be a nightclub-do not tout yourself as a lunchdinner restaurant.  We are an easy going group of women age 40 to 60 who meet once a month for lunch, price is never an issue and we never, ever do the dreaded separate check thing so rarely have issues but this outing was absolutely the worst experience we have ever had, individually or collectively.

"You can't hear yourself think in this place never mind talk to and hear another person. It's a meat market if ever there was one. Wall-to-wall people. Even getting a beer is a Herculean task! If you're looking to meet an interesting, sophisticated woman, then look elsewhere. The crowd is definitely for those in their 20s. It's full of those women who grew up with Paris Hilton and Britney Spears as role models and adore Lady Gaga. I recommend Mabel's if you want an opportunity to meet a beauty with brains to match.

"Went there on a Saturday night. At 11:00 PM, nobody in line, waited for 10 minutes (still first in line) and asked the bouncer what is going on and why we can't we get in. ----- you have to wait !!!!

If it wants to maintain the reputation that they are putting out there, the they need to get organized with the lines in front, hire better bouncers who are not jerks, and not to turn away or make people wait for 30 minutes who are paying for bottles.

"First fail: no Malibu. BUSTED! Second fail: not being able to use the empty parking lot on a Wednesday afternoon without valet parking. Really Valet parking is used so you don't have to park a million blocks away and you pay for the convenience of having someone go run after it. Not so you can rape patrons by having them pay $8 to get out the car, drive 10 feet and park it.Third fail: bartenders these days in Scottsdale, where DO they come from My friend ordered a dirty martini and he didn't know what that was... mon dieu, The Mint.

We've been there twice now.  The first time we had a good time, but that was more due to the company than the place.  The food is well below average.  As long as you are having a drink, make sure it's wine or beer, since their mixed drinks are among the worst we've ever had.  The staff is the ultimate in snobbery.  Pass.

"When I heard Bad Boy Bill was coming to The Mint in February, I was ecstatic. Problem is, this place has no dance floor. How do you invite one of the all-time great DJs to a place without a dance-floor Just plain stupid. Management has explicitly said on Yelp they are ""not a club"" and I can understand that, but they should probably just stick to the regular Top 40 if they don't have a dance-floor. In my opinion, just a bad look on their part. I will be driving to Vegas for XS to have a real party to which The Mint cannot supply. Nor do I plan to give The Mint a fourth try.

"This past weekend I went to the mint for their 24K brunch which is supposed to be amazing.  Unfortunately I didn't even get the chance to try it.  I walked in with 2 friends and was not even acknowledged by the hostess.  We had to ask for a menu and were rudely handed them.  We asked for a table and she said to seat ourselves so we did.  We were promptly given waters by who I believe was a buser.  We asked to order drinks and he said our server would be right with us.  After 30 minutes we gave up and left. Our server never came.  We asked multiple people where they were and the answer was always that they would be right there. I was appalled that this happened.  I was looking forward to testing this brunch out.  Service is important and The Mint has terrible service.

"Being a resident of Scottsdale, I try to give all local restaurants & bars a chance. I was incredibly disappointed with The Mint's menu prices and items. We ordered their sizzled shrimp (7 to be exact) which soaked in a dish of sauce, this dish could have been much better had they added rice to this twelve dollar item which would probably cost them little to nothing to add. Instead, you have to pay for a tiny side of rice. The sliders were an asian slider which was soaked in a rice bun. The meat on this ""slider"" was full of gristle and had tons of lettuce. Last, we were still starving so we ordered dessert. LOL - Let me tell you, we ordered their goat cheese wonton. When they say, ""wonton"" they mean ONE! The wonton was the size of a quarter and that was it! If this place wants to strive during the week, they need to add a great HH menu and put more food on their dishes. A huge disappointment!!

"I was excited to see that a ""champagne lounge"" would be the newest addition to Market Square's continuing revitalization. Champagne on tap! Who knew! Unfortunately, Perle falls flat on its face in almost every regard. The decor is, well, trashy. It's all black upholstered couches and recessed, multi-colored LED lights a la frat boy with an interior design budget. I was unaware that the prevailing aesthetic of the CENTER of downtown Pittsburgh is trending towards Bridge and Tunnel coke den. Come on Perle, we're better than that. Perle also seems to think that it's possible to cram a ""nightclub"", ""restaurant"", and ""lounge"" into the same, relatively small space. It doesn't work. They should have stopped with the menu and fancy drinks and not continued to the obnoxiously loud music emanating, I kid you not, from a kid with a MacBook and an accompanying saxophonist ""playing' what can only be described as 1991-inspired acid jazz. Gross. Finally, there was an entourage of what looked to be the ownermanager the night I visited making it feel like the place is an extension of someone's living room and not in a good way, in a clubby way. Of course I realize that my opinion may be in the minority as there are likely throngs of Cranberrians and Wexfordites who will be thrilled at the prospect of a ""real night out"" in tahn. Knock yourselves out, I'll happily be steering well clear.

"Will not be back. Had two champagne cocktails which were very mediocre. The type of champagne wasn't even listed on the menu - cant imagine it was anything worthwhile. What tipped me off at first to the atmosphere was the carpetted steps going to the bar. More carpet at the space at the front of the bar. Moving in, the group of 5 I was with found ourselves standing in the middle of what may possibly been intended as a dance floor - this was at aboun10 pm - but no one was dancing. So it was awkward. There were no tables to set your drinks on. But all that aside - I would have been ok with the place except for this - the worst part - the crowd. 35+ bridge and tunnel, may have money. No. Class. Very sleazy looking men and women who think they're attractive but are not. At all.  Just such awful clientele.

"I had a similar experience to Brooke's. I have been to this place four times and I would have given it three stars up until my last visit.  The store is small but has quite an eclectic collection of books and I've never left empty handed. I spent close to $100 there last Christmas which amounted to about 30% of my overall budget for gifts. The service was average at best but I'm fanatical about supporting locally owned businesses. My one really negative experience I had there has me vowing to never return and go back to making my weekly trek to Changing Hands. I had brought two plastic tubs packed full of books to sell. I'm notorious for hoarding books and I always feel a bit emotional when letting some go but I was moving and wanted to thin my collection out a bit. I called ahead to inquire what time would be best to bring them in. When I arrived I carried the first box in a began to set it down to return for the second when a woman snapped at me and rudely said ""don't set those there!"".  I was a bit offended but chalked it up to her having a bad day.  Another customer walked in who she apparently knew and asked how things were going and she said ""ok but the store will probably go under if I have to keep spending money on all the books people keep bringing in"".  In retrospect I should have gathered up my books and left. I already was a little bummed about parting with the books and now I'm feeling like I'm an inconvenience to this woman. The guy behind the counter looked embarrassed by her behavior and told me it would be about an hour so I decided to browse around the store. I always keep a list of books I want to read on my phone so it thought I'd pick up my next couple of reads. The whole time I was obviously attempting to locate my books I was never once offered assistance, yet several other customers who came in after me were offered a warm greeting and assistance. I suppose it was because they had not had the audacity to bring in books to sell.  Maybe because I'm heavily tattooed with several piercings she had judged me as somebody not likely to spend much money in there.  Well I read a LOT of books and although I have an IPad I only read about 10% of them in digital format. Prior to walking in I had planned on just taking store credit for the books and would likely spend 5 times that much over the course of the year. After that miserable experience I took the money and ran.

It was definitely a wasted trip for me and one that I will not ever again repeat. Next time I will go back to Bookmans.

"Most people will try to tell you that Zia Records is the best record store in the valley. Those people would be correct.Why the low score, then Because being Crown Prince of the Turd Playground that is Phoenix's record store selection is not exactly a glowing accomplishment. This store does several things wrong.For one, this location in particular pesters the shite out of you. ""Are you finding everything alright"", ""Are you finding everything alright"" YES! Jesus Christ, I was finding everything alright the first four times you asked me, now be a good little retail monkey and leave me the bloody hell alone so I can shop and eventually give you my money!I'm sure it's this economy business that's to blame, and not necessarily corporate nonsense, but someone needs to take their manager out back and explain that annoying the piss out of your customers may actually be worse than ignoring them. And it's just this store! I went to the T-Bird location and wasn't bothered. Someone casually asked me if there was anything I needed, and I said ""No"" and was done with it. But at this store, I was literally asked three separate times by the SAME IDIOT if I was finding everything okay!Perhaps it was the annoying tunes they had playing that added to the grating atmosphere. Censored Rap (Not that I'm a fan, but hearing the song go silent every five seconds to omit a blatant swear is fairly tiresome after awhile) 70's Funk and bad Butt Rock seem to be on the menu ad nauseum. Though, in fairness, perhaps it's just the staff during the morning or something. I notice at night it gets a bit better... if you can crawl out from beneath all the employees asking you if you're doing okay long enough to even notice.I've never gathered the courage to stand in the line of leering meth addicts at the Trade Counter to tell you whether they give decent store credit for used stuff, though, so I'll leave it to greater minds to judge that facet of their business model. I will say that their used stuff is in good enough shape... if you don't count the bleeding stickers they put on absolutely everything! You inevitably spend twice the time you would have spent actually listening to your purchase doing nothing but peeling tape and stickers. They're worse than Gamestop, that way. I payed for it, it's mine. Why are you putting your ugly stickers all over my albumBad neighbourhood, too.I hate to sound so negative without balancing out with some positive, but the experience is fairly fresh in my mind as I just went earlier today. I guess their prices are good, unless you want something newish. In which case, bending over and having plenty of lube handy is the best advice I can offer.Just know what you want. Go in. Get out. And for god's sake, avoid their overzealous employees as if they were landmines.Or just give the constant irritants a pass and go to a different location. Or Bookman's. I know I will.

"I enjoyed this place in the 90's. But I really don't see why it still exists. Does anyone buy CD's anymore I can get any DVDBluRay I want on Ebay. If I wanted tacky trinkets I could go to some place like Spencer's in the mall or Red Hot Robot if I fancied myself ""cool.""

"I found an LP I was looking for at a very fair price on their website. After paying $15.00 shipping, it took several weeks to receive since they only put $4.22 postage on it to cover the media mail charge. Plus they shipped it 2 weeks after I paid. So they overcharged me $10 for shipping AND dragged their feet in shipping it. I would avoid using them for any type of mail order. Says a lot about their business ethics, or lack thereof.

"I agree with Ian below as well. The Moonlight Masquerade event was the worst planned event I've ever attended. There was absolutely no theme concept, the music was atrociously paired (and half of the acts were unlistenable), they quickly ran out of food, drinks, and souvenirs within 45 minutes, and THE TICKETS WERE 60 FRIKKIN DOLLARS!!! The Botanical Garden was quickly becoming a great cultural institution for it's well planned and designed events, its great variety of performers and entertainment, and its ties to the arts community in the valley. I have heard from ex-volunteers that all the talented people in the events department have quit or been fired in the last six months because the dimwit department heads don't want to lose their jobs. They are now breaking contracts with performers, treating guest artists and garden staff poorly, getting cheap and poor quality entertainment, and mis-planning their events. It's too bad. Looks like a bunch of fools are running the place now and I am disappointed because DBG has the potential to be a real cultural institution in Phoenix - a city that has far too few.

"We attended a wedding reception here in June, 2013.  I was going to let it slide, but I've changed my mind.  We were really looking forward to the dinner because we had had such positive experiences at the Sunday brunches with delicious food.  Not so much at the wedding.  No where to sit during the long (over an hour) cocktail hout.  Servers  would come out with maybe 10 appetizers on a tray and would be attacked by the first few peopole they passed.  I actually only got two tiny appetizers the entire time.   When we finally went into the room (same room where the brunches are hel), we we very disappointed in the total LACK of decor.  Absolutely nothing to indicate that there was anything speciazl - let alone a wedding - going on.  No centerpeicesd - might have been the couple's decision - I don't know.  Dinner was not served for almost 1 12 hours - we were one of the last tables to be served.  My chicken was over-cooked (actually hard on the edges - couldn't cut) and ice cold.  A guest at our table had steak - and couldn't chew it and it also was cold.  The salads were so under-dressed that we questioned whether they had any dressing at all.  It was a huge dissapointment.  The groom was visably not happy.  For what they paid per person, we shuld have had exceptonal food and service.  Both were sorely lacking.  Sure, it's impressive to say you attended a receptiuon at Phipps, but the people who attended were extremely underwhelmed and definitely disappointed.  My heart went out to the couple!

So I was happy they were impressed, but as Kate F. mentioned, the exhibits are depressingly small, and the aptly named Room of Death should be condemned by zoos everywhere. The only truly enjoyable moments were watching the beavers carry rocks and logs, and spotting a few enormous fish. Otherwise, the Biodome was lackluster at best. Actually, I'm surprised that eco-friendly Canada stands for the place to be kept open, considering how inhumanely tiny the animals' living spaces are. Honestly, how can a beaver truly be happy in a bathtub-sized pool If there's a Canadian Humane Society, I hope they get up off their haunches and shut this place down.

"Not a good vegan experience.  We were meeting friends at Casbah for dinner -their choice.  Since I follow a version of vegan, I called ahead and was assured that they had vegan versions of a couple of pasta dishes.  Server was very cooperative and said she would instruct the kitchen to omit the meat and  increase the veggies on their cavatelli.   Well, they omitted the meat, but I was left with one of the smallest servings of pasta that I have ever seen.  At about $20, it was close to the price of caviar!

"Three strikes and you're out!  We had brunch there a few months back, and the meal was so salty that we could barely begin to eat it.  That meal was comped and I figured it was an off day.  We went back about a month later for dinner, and that meal was also very salty and we could not finish it.  We were willing to try again, so we went for dinner tonight.  I ordered the filet, and it was like eating a salt shaker.  I was shocked that, for a third time, I had a piss poor meal at Casbah.  I sent that back, and ordered the sea bass.  When I got to the end of the piece of fish, it was raw.  Needless to say, I will NEVER return to this restaurant.  Looking back, what should I have expected from the sister restaurant of Mad Mex

"It pains me to say after Blue was my favorite restaurant for yeeeeears but spending 12 hours sick as a dog without  them doing a thing about it has forced me too.On Dec 18 2010 we sprang for an overnight sitter, got a room at the Omni, and a reservation at Blue (our favorite restaurant)  By the time dinner was over I needed to use the restroom and after that barely made it back to the Omni where I spent the rest of the night on the toilet.  I have eaten food from street vendors in Asia, Africa, and Mexico and have NEVER had a problem; yes I have intestines of steel.I called Blue the next day to warn them if nothing else and was told ""the chef is off but I will let him know""  I never heard another thing.  I wasn't looking for a million dollars, but I spent $400 for a romantic evening on the john.  Mistakes happen, I am just disappointed in Blues lack of response or concern for a loyal customer.
",0
"So I just rushed home from Blue because I couldn't wait to get on here and give them this review.  Ok, I'm lying.  I made one stop on the way home - Barnes and Noble -  to buy a dictionary so I could find the words to explain just how bad this place was for me.  If not for it being restaurant week, thus having reduced pricing, I might have 'made a scene.'So I'll start with a service review since I can sum it up with one simple fact: 2 hours and 15 minutes into dinner (restaurant week I remind you - simplified menu, 3 courses) we were still waiting on stuff to be brought to the table.  The service was atrocious and incredibly slow.  At the 2 hour and 15 minute mark, we finally just flagged down the waitress, told her to box up the food, box up the desserts that hadn't arrived yet, just so we could finally get the heck out of there.  Initially I thought this was part of the ""Blue experience,"" but its not.  The waitress came by every 30 minutes, took the order for the next course, and it took an hour for each course to come out.  So the food is boxed and i come home, nightmare over, right  Wrong! they boxed up my friends food and gave it to me, boxed his up an gave it to the 3rd couple that was with us, etc, etc, etc.  So NOBODY went home with their own food.  I love my friends, but I'm not nibbling at their food scraps.  So, food, how was the the food  Not quite horrible, but not quite good either.  Edible is a better word for it.  I got the ""Grilled Niman Ranch Pork Rack Chop - with a Tuscan white gigante bean and kale ragout finished with a sweet Italian saba.""  sounds fancy, eh  Well, it was basically lukewarm vegetable soup, with a hint of chef boyardee, and a dinky pork chop dropped right in the middle.  It was so boring and bland, i question the chef's competence and would openly challenge him to a cook-off if this is as good as he could do.  I could walk into a grocery store blindfolded, randomly grab something, bring it home and microwave it for 3 minutes, and I would still like my chances.  Nobody at the table was impressed with anything they ordered.So let's circle back for a second, and return to service.  The waitress was very nice and knowledgeable I have to say.  Maybe she was just over capacity  I don't know.  But she recognized our frustration and had the manager bring our to-go boxes to us and apologize for the delays and long waits between courses (I think).  This is how that conversation went:Manager: ""hey guys, sorry things took a little long, you know uh, restaurant week and the kitchen got backed up.  But how was everything""Me: ""Well, it was ok.  some things were pretty good i suppose, some better than others.""Manager: (blank stare)Me:  (awkward moment)Manager; ""well sorry again, and uh i mean, you know ehhhh...."" (blank stare).Me: (still awkward so I'm just going to stand up now and leave).Manager: (blank stare and walks away).needless to say, I will never come back here again.  If it were free, I would probably still pass.  If asked what could they do to make it right, i would respond with a full refund of the entire dinner, plus compensation for the 2 hours and 30 minutes of my life that I'll never get back.

"The food was literally inedible. We had calimari as our app & it was very yummy. We were excited about our entrees based on this course. My husband ordered the shrimp gnocchi dish. It tasted like orange peels-even the shrimp. There was a pesto sauce & orange rinds in the dish, which we thought was an interesting combo. I never tasted such an overwhelming orange dish in my life. Nothing had any other taste except orange zest. I had the duck, which was okay. Nothing to write home about. The duck was really rough & fatty. Came with a side of asparagus & rice. The veggies & rice were okay. I preferred them over the duck. For dessert, we ordered the cheesecake to split. We didn't even finish it. Would definitely NEVER go back

"I am sorry to be writing this review.  My first visit to Blue a few years ago was fabulous.  The service was very good!  But, this time not only was the food not impressive, but it was totally boring! The calamari appetizer was good, but not worth $11.00.  The hummus appetizer was 2 golf ball sized clumps with almost no flavor.  Not even arranged to be appealing to the eye.  My tenderloin was nothing to write home about and the risotto was a mushy, tasteless ,  glob with Carmelized onions on it that looked reheated...also not  flavorful.  The baked in house bread were blah, and butter was not offered.  It could have used it to help the taste.  Dessert was the same...an amaretto cheesecake that tasted like it was left in the oven way too long....dry.   I love good food.  But, this evening was an utter disappointment.  It was a birthday celebration, and I did not want to spoil it with complaints about the food.  I also think my guest did not want me to feel bad for bringing them to this place I raved about prior to going. Service was great, but the server talked me out of a couple of things I considered getting.  Made me think whomever was doing the cooking that night...A Saturday was not good at certain things.  Extremely overpriced.  Btw...coffee was $6.50.  C'mon now!  Good but not that much!  Sorry, but I will not go back.  I was sooo looking forward to this special evening,  and it was an utter disappointment.

"This was adequte at best and that is being generous.  Several of us Went today for Easter brunch - big disappointment.  The restaurant was not that busy - took 20 minutes between courses being served.  Needed to ask for plates for the muffins.  Ordered the filet with eggs - the eggs were burnt and broken.  The server never should have brought that plate to the table.  I expect this from Denny's at 3 am - not a restaurant with these menu prices.  My boyfriend had the tomato bisque soup - was Ragu in a bowl - even same consistency.  Another friend had the bananas foster french toast - even the bananas were bland.

"Horrible customer service!  Strangely rude and condescending.  I confronted them about their attitude, which was unnecessary.  I know when poor service is justified as I've been in the industry and given it myself!  It was unjustified and quite odd, actually.  We politely (key word) asked where a few of the ingredients were that the menu listed for our meal and that's when they became defensive and quite weird about it. Strangely rude and almost demeaning, saying it was a waste to send it back.  The pizza was slopped together the first AND the second time, and I don't even trust what they did to it in the kitchen.  Yes, this is the feel I got from them, being our server, Zach and the other man whom I believe to be the bartender or the manager.   We were running a pretty high drink bill and there was no need for the negative energy. It ruined our experience and vibe of the place.  Over a pizza  Poor service, poor choices.

"Disappointing to say the least. Was looking forward to wine, friends, conversation and a little nosh after the artwalk...what we got was surprisingly poor customer service that became downright passive aggressive (scratch the passive) after we received a pizza that wasn't to our liking. The waiter was so upset that we didn't want mozzarella cheese on our $10 goat cheese pizza that he brought out the cook to confirm. His manager then came by our table to tell us that we, the customers, should be aware that pizza is always served with mozz cheese. (Oh really astute one) 20 minutes later the manager returned with a pizza drowining in goat cheese and we were informed that we should be happy because we were getting ""a bang for our buck"". We felt so harassed by the wait staff because of this stupid $10 pizza that we actually feared they vandalized the food (yes, you know the feeling of wondering ""did that waiter spit in my dish""). We left confused by the entire experience. I would never never never never never go again and I will tell everyone I know to avoid this place like the plague.

"I can hardly believe how highly rated this restaurantwine bar is. I have been twice and both times was treated to high prices, poor and condescending service and mediocre food.Once I ordered a veggie plate specifically because the menu stated that it included haricot verts. When the plate came they were not on it. I questioned the server and she said they were ""out of season"", but had not bothered to tell me in advance that the menu item would not be as described. Against my better judgment I went back a second time with a wine tasting group. Some political thing was to take place in the restaurant hours later. It was being set up for so we were shunted to some tables we didn't want, service was abysmal and the food and wine were really overpriced for what we received. I will never go back.

"My friends and I went to Cheuvront's for AZ Restaurant Week and every single one of us was disappointed. The service was terrible; it took 20 minutes for our fourth (who arrived a few minutes late) just to get her water. He disappeared for 15 minute stretches and only asked if needed anything when we were done with our courses. The food was overpriced for the portions--and this is coming from a graduated culinary student who has had it drilled into her that smaller is better--and the flavors were bland. One person's bisque came to the table cold and my creme brulee tasted as if they'd forgotten the sugar. Not to mention that it was so loud we couldn't hear each other. All around disappointing.

"Several friends and I came here during Arizona Restaurant week, we made reservations, arrived on time and planned on having a good time. The place was half-empty and we didn't get service for water for atleast 10 minutes. We wanted to order a bottle of wine, but they ran out of the one we wanted...it was only 6pm. The waitress had a really hard time recommending another, and the one she said was similar was rather icky. (Nothing like the wine we wanted that we've had before). We weren't able to order for atleast another 30minutes and weren't served our first course for 30 minutes after that. We didn't start to eat until we had been there for an hour at minimum. In addition, the blackberry creme brulee also suddenly became ""out of stock,"" and we had to choose something else. This was all during one of the best promotional weeks for this restaurant. I would never come back here. Ever.

"A few months ago I wrote a very positive review of this place.  Starting about in September, however, something very odd and unpleasant happened to Cheuvront.  The lunch service became slow, to the point where I thought I'd been forgotten.  Worse, the food started to change in unpleasant ways.  Gone were the good ingredients and subtle flavorings.  Suddenly everything was layered on in huge blobs and weighted down with unnecessary spices.Specifically, I'm talking about the lunch pizzas I had for lunch at Cheuvront so many times before.  Last time I went, a few weeks ago, I suddenly noticed that they used nearly four times the cheese necessary.  Today, there was four times the cheese, at least two or three times the sauce, along with chunks of nearly raw garlic.Worse, the cheese on my pizza was cool and congealed, showing that it had been sitting around for a while before the wait staff deigned to bring it to me.I was embarrassed to have suggested to a colleague that we eat at Cheuvront today.  I don't know what happened to this restaurant, but at least the lunch service is a total loss.

"Well where to start... my friends and I were walking past when 2 men approached us and one said, ""Hi, I'm Jason Cheuvront,"" which we thought was really tacky.  Once in the restaurant a hostess asked us if we wanted a table and how many in our party; she then walked away and did not return, so we had to seat ourselves.  We ordered happy hour drinks, and the glass of wine I ordered tasted like vinegar and smelled spoiled.  When I told our server he said, ""I won't smell it because I don't like to tell customers that they are wrong."" I was so shocked by his response that I did not order another drink.  The server took the glass of wine back behind the bar, and we then saw the owners and bartenders trying the wine and rolling their eyes.  Later, the server returned and told me I could order any drink, not just something off the happy hour menu, (wasn't sure if it would be on the house or not) and then never returned to take my order. When we finally tracked down another server, I ordered a sangria.  The server gave me a blank stare and said they did not have sangria even though it was plainly listed on their drink menu.  Enough was enough!  We left cash on the table and left.

"Wanted to go try this place out for Restaurant Week. Stopped in and when we were greeted at the front we were told the earliest we could get in was at 9pm. There were many empty tables and there wasn't even a waiting list for people without reservations. The situation at the door just wasn't handled very well. Can't comment on the food but we'll eat at one of the other hundred restaurants in the metro area. We know we can get some food there.

"Snippy waitress. Ran out of bruschetta and caprece salad. Caesar salad was warm shredded lettuce (apparently including iceberg) and tomatoes with some sort of non garlic dressing that was barely able to be tasted. That is not a Caesar salad.  Flatbread came without being cut into manageable slices and crumbled all over the place. Was told the bruschetta would have been made on facacio  bread  if they had any. That is not bruschetta.  My companions ordered shared salad and flatbread which arrived without sharing plates.  The kitchen was slow and the wait staff insufferable. The chef is obviously very high on himself.

"I have a degree in hotel and restaurant management so you could probably say that i am a little more critical than most people when it comes to eating out.  Tonight my girlfriend and I went to Christo's.  Our server was horribly slow at taking our drink orders and a table that came in after us already had their salads before we had even placed our order.  The food was mediocre at best we got to go boxes because after an hour of sitting in the restaurant that apparently caters to close personal friends of Abe Lincoln that have nothing more to do than waste an evening at an overpriced restaurant to fill up on caesar salad that tastes like it was dipped in anchovy paste and wish that you hadn't ordered the veal genovese because it just looks like someone threw up on your plate you just want to get out of there.

"Awful canneloni served on a bath of poorly prepared heavy cream. Very 'unItalian', even the bread tastes stale and poorly prepared. The minestroni soup tasted like canned soup, just right for the strictly senior citizen clientele. My husband had a pasta with Italian sausage and chicken in a marinara sauce. The chunks of canned tomatoes were unappetizing. The one star is awarded for the only good item we ate, the Greek side salad. The waiter was totally goofy, rude and uninterested. He flopped the canneloni at the table with the statement, ""Two enchiladas."" Really First time but never again! Disgusting food, terrible service.

"I really don't even know where to start with this place.  I've lived in Central Phoenix for 8 years and have always heard about how great this place was.  That's the only reason I didn't turn around and walk out upon entering.  The decor in this place is cluttered, old, and feels dirty.  They sell most of their ""decorations"" and if you are looking for a basket from 1984 you will surely find one. The floors, the tables, the walls - everything just looks old and worn.  I don't find that particularly appetizing.  So I figured, this place must make one hell of a sandwich to keep such a high reputation, and placed my order.  While very nice, the staff is s...l...o...w...  I ordered the briesciutto.  I figured brie, prosciutto, sun dried tomatoes - can't mess that up, right  Wrong.  The French bread was hard as a rock and was way too much bread.  The sun dried tomatoes were huge, but overpowered everything else.  I couldn't taste the brie or the prosciutto.     For what I paid and what I've heard, I had expected much better.  I was very disappointed in the entire experience.My overall recommendation: just go across the parking lot to Einstein's.

"Our weekly Empowerment meeting creates around lunch. It seems we are forever looking for a place that has good prices and a quiet place for us to brainstorm and raise our energy. We have stumbled upon Duck and Decanter. Finding this restaurant is only half the battle, the other is where the heck the front door is. I felt I was intruding on the outside patrons, only to realize I had to meander through, taking a glimpse at what they were devouring to get to the front door, an added bonus I suppose. Opening the front door to a happily buzzing place seemed like quite a treat. To your right is small wine area, to the left were barrels and stuff. A bit confusing, but basically it is like walking into a deli shop of olden days. I had no idea what I was doing. I stood in line and squinted at the barely visible menu of an array of deli meats, smoked meats, salads and more. Of course being gluten intolerant one can hope she has hit the conscious jackpot..but not today...I will just have the insides..no bun! But wait! I see smoked duck and wait..I can order the sandwich of my choice and have it made into a salad. Well that is a great compromise! Of course to know me is to know I am gunna ask a lot of questions, my main concern, does the smoked duck use nitrites, nitrates or any of those other nasty carcinogens. Rather shocked by the question, the gentleman serving me has no idea and had no intentions of looking. Damn! I was really hoping for the duck! I quickly go with plan B as I weigh nitrites or high fructose corn syrup and soybean oil..with that it was the tuna salad. You can not pay for your meal in advance as the idea is to meander the store..so I did. there were barrels of tea and coffee ready to be ground at your request. I was not impressed with the coffee grinder on the floor-ewwww. There was also an espresso area but it was not operational. There are gadgets to buy for your kitchen, and packaged condiments and foods that I presume they make fresh there. There are fountain drinks , bottled drinks, good assortment of water and non alcoholic beer, and loads of sugary add ons within tempting reach right at the cash register-brilliant! And there is not tempting this fort Knox (well the rice cripsy treats looked..nooo must...resist...I get my food, pay and go up stairs. There are different levels and two places to sit outside, which makes this place even more interesting. I open my package and there right on top are two pieces of bread stuck to my tuna. I read the entry for the Entree salad and it said nothing about adding in the bread. I ordered the salad due to the fact I can not tolerate gluten. Too hungry to care, I peel off the bread and I dive into my food and I am shocked at how awful it is. What is that mushy stuff I think it was water chestnuts in my tuna salad. Who puts water chestnuts, (if that was what it was) in their tuna salad I was unimpressed with the fact that the tuna salad was put on a bed of spring lettuce (which is a thumbs up for this nutritionist), some sliced celery and string cheese. Cheese! Who eats cheese with their tuna The tuna itself was extremely dry and too salty for my liking, and I had a tough time getting it down, and eventually I got so turned off I did not finish it. There was no dressing and no taste.  I ended up not eating the salad either. What a waste of  $10.00 including guilt tip! At least the company I was with was fantastic! Some restaurants ask you if you have been to their establishment before so that they can have the opportunity to give you the best experience possible. I truly believe this is something Duck and Decanter could adopt. Maybe I was supposed to order dressing, I have no idea. Since I had never been there before and did not know what I was doing. I did ask someone else about the ingredients and she took the time to look and confirmed my suspicions-sigh. I can't wait until there is a conscious shift to what we are putting in our bodies and those who are Celiac or gluten intolerant can eat without anxiety! Is this a place for those who are Celiac or gluten intolerant NO there is not enough awareness of ingredients, and handling of food. Bathrooms yes weird..outside of the building, but clean. Would I return No but for the sake of my friends, which is way more important, I will and eat some where else first.

"So, I've been going to this place for years, not bc the food blows my mind, but rather it hits the spot. Plus, I love sitting on the patio drinking wine when the weather is nice with my best gal. Anyhow, my other best gal, my mom had never tried this spot. I  thought Duck would be great for a quick casual lunch. She's a vegetarian so we ordered the Where's the Beef sandwich to share. It took about 20 minutes to make the sandwich, which feels like an eternity when your hungry.When I glanced at the sandwich I thought perhaps they had added some portobello mushrooms to it. Turns out, the dark brown layer was actually rotten avocado. REALLY!!!! I mean come on! Avocado is like prime rib to vegetarians. How can you F this up It was truly nasty. It got me to thinking, if someone actually put this into the sandwich, what else would their low standards allow them to place into an unsuspecting victims sammie. It's not like they make them with blindfolds on. I was really grossed out.When I brought it to the manager's attention, she didn't seem that bothered by it. They remade half a sandwich for me, and that was that.It was annoying bc I left feeling that Duck & Decanter takes for granted the fact that loyal customers will stick with them no matter what. Well, not this one.Plus, that place needs a serious dusting. Yuck.

What is the point of this website if people can't write their opinion Obviously whoever is in charge of this restaurant's yelp site didn't want people to see how POORLY my children and I were treated at this establishment. A friend of mine and our 3 little boys (two of them babies) came into eat yesterday when a manager came to us and told us we needed to quiet it down. It was quite ridiculous and offensive, seeing that two of the children are ONE year. Yes sir, let me talk some sense into my baby and tell him that he is being rude. I bring my children out to eat quite often and have never had this issue, my kids are not in any way out of control or bratty.

"I was a fan of this place 10 years ago and moved out of state. I recently moved back and was excited to take my partner and out of town guests to this eatery!  It was awful, long wait, skimpy sandwich, loud music on patio, so loud and somewhat abrasive when the singer talked to the audience. I couldn't hear or talk to the person sitting right next to me.   This was the 29th and a Sunday brunch.  Disappointed, will not go back, especially since there are so many new and fantastic eateries in Phoenix!  You can't rely on a name, Duck and Decanter, your poor service, etc will catch up and you will not survive.  My advice to all who ask,  where is a good place to eat, I will say not Duck and Decanter!

"Food poisoning for two, please...I am really confused by all the 4-star and 5-star reviews for this place. The 4-star average Yelp rating was the reason my wife and I chose to dine here during our stay in Phoenix. Yelp, you really let us down this time.So I was on company business travel in Phoenix the week of March 12th and my wife was traveling with me. We had a French impulse that Tuesday night and tried to crash Petite Maison in Scottsdale, only to find out that reservations were required and there were no tables available. The following night, still craving French cuisine, we decided to stop in at Sophie's French Bistro in Phoenix.The first warning sign was that the place was entirely empty during peak dinner hours. However, encouraged by the strong reviews on Yelp, we decided to go ahead and order. We took advantage of a couple of happy hour specials and ordered the following...3 Cheese PlateChef's PateCalamariCrispy Duck BreastCreme BruleeThe food was average at best. My wife and I both tend to critique food as we eat it, and we both found ourselves commenting that the portions were small and the food was overpriced for what it was. Most of what we ate was bland and the pate had a very odd flavor and consistency.The fun started about 4 hours later when we were back in our hotel room. We both started experiencing various internal moaning and groaning, followed by the onset of stomach pain. No big deal, I thought... By shortly after midnight, we were each fighting for time in the bathroom, taking turns to vomit up everything we had eaten that night. I'll try to spare you the details, but this was the kind of violent and uncontrollable vomiting that I have only experienced perhaps once before in my entire life. Needless to say, diarrhea was also involved.After going through this for a good two hours, my wife and I were both thoroughly exhausted and dehydrated. My wife even told me she felt like she was dying, and said that she had never felt this bad before - not even during child birth. o.OSo by around 2:30am, my wife was begging for me to call an ambulance. For a while, neither of us could get up off the floor to reach the telephone. I eventually found a break in the vomiting and managed to sip down enough water to recover slightly. I carried my wife out to the car and asked the hotel receptionist for directions to the nearest hospital.We drove to John C. Lincoln Hospital on Dunlap, which I recommend if you ever get poisoned by Sophie's French Bistro. I managed to get there without hitting anything, which was remarkable since I could barely see straight and could barely function at all. Once inside, my wife completely collapsed and was unconscious briefly. The nurses and doctors rushed her into the ER and brought her back around. They gave her a shot of morphine and then hooked her up to an IV drip of fluids. As I waited, I continued to experience vomiting and tried to keep myself hydrated. Despite being in a hospital, I was determined not to check myself in for treatment, not wanting to add further medical bills.Sometime around 5:00am, my wife was ready to be discharged. The official diagnosis was acute food poisoning. We were never able to identify the specific meal at Sophie's which poisoned us, as we both shared the same courses and ate equal amounts each.However - and this is the kicker - when the doctors asked us where we had eaten dinner and we told them it was Sophie's, they remarked ""oh, that place!"". We learned that the ER at John C. Lincoln has seen 3 other cases of food poisoning caused by Sophie's. The hospital took our information for the purpose of compiling a complaint against Sophie's with the AZ Department of Health Services. They told us that once they have at least 10 confirmed cases, then they are required by law to report the incident as a disease outbreak.This all would have been nice to know before we chose to dine at this place. I can only assume that the other poisoning victims either don't use the internet, or are still laying in a pool of vomit somewhere, too weak to write a review.Please, please, PLEASE don't put yourself through the same hell that we went through that night. After this experience, we lost all desire to dine in Phoenix ever again. Thanks, Sophie's, for ruining our trip.For the record, we did have an excellent meal at CIBO Pizza the night before we were poisoned. I highly recommend CIBO. Great food, without food poisoning.

"The place was pretty deserted...I discovered  why. The inside has a slightly funky odor, like spoiled cheese and cheap wine. The owner was a sour faced jerk who demanded to know what I wanted. I'm assuming he was the owner because he had a European accent and his clothes were better than mine. And he had an aura of arrogance and authority.That's all it took for me to turn around and walk out the door. If all French bistros are like this one, then I'm steering clear of them in general. Sophie's really sucks.

"Visiting Postino Wine Cafe makes me feel like I am in another city... an urban, metro, pedestrian city such as San Francisco. Its casual, yet sophisticated and quite enjoyable. I recently visited Postino with two friends and had the Bruschetta -- we selected the Fresh Mozzarella with Tomato and Basil, the Smoked Salmon and the Roasted Peppers with Goat Cheese. Thumbs up on all of these yummy appetizers! The clientele is a hip, diverse crowd reflective of its gentrified, charming neighborhood of mid-century ranch homes, and yet just a hop from the Biltmore and Arcadia neighborhoods. Ah... Phoenix is growing up! Wish I knew more about wines to tell you more about that. It appeared to be a nice selection and there were bottles you can buy to take home as well. Parking is a challenge, however I will definitely be back.http:www.postinowinecafe.comUpdate: Postino's is one of many restaurantsbars in AZ that permits concealed weapons without permits and is noted on the Arizona State Rifle and Pistol Association in their CCW Cafe page: http:www.asrpa.comccwcafe.html For that reason I am reducing the previously 5-star rating to 1-star.

"I won't even venture to guess why so many people like this place. But a few notes: no, it is nothing like a European cafe; no, it is not an actual wine bar; yes the service absolutely sucks.We came here for a friend's birthday party. Her mother had arranged ahead of time for 10 of us to be there and to have wine brought to the tables and poured and some appetizers brought out while we were waiting for the guest of honor. But before that, let's start with parking. You can't park in the residential streets because you need a permit. Fine. I heard they had a valet and there's nothing on their website about parking so, whatever. I head to the valet who asks me if I am dining at Postino's or La Grande Orange. I say Postino's and he says ""Ok, that's $3."" I asked if they seriously were charging me for valet parking based on which restaurant I was going to and they wouldn't answer. I asked if there was an ATM since I had no cash and they told me there is one but it doesn't work. I got back in my car and drove around looking for a place to park for about 15 minutes. Fantastic.When I get there, about 6 girls from the party are standing at the front waiting for someone to notice them. Finally, a very unfriendly gentleman pointed to two tables and said ""Those are yours. Those other tables where people are eating are also yours but they're not done yet. We told them when they were seated they needed to be done in an hour but they're still there."" Ok, so now we only have two of our four tables. Great. Finally they seat us at our two tables. Another unfriendly staff member comes over and plunks down a few wine glasses and asks if we want a glass of temperanillo. She pours one of the girls a random taste and then walks away. Upon her return I asked if this was the wine we were supposed to have because it was a Malbec. She argued with me about that for a few minutes until I pointed to the label. She said ""Oh"" and walked away. I never did find out if we were supposed to have the Malbec.At this point, the other two tables had been cleared. No one brought any other glasses or put the tables together, so we did it. Also, no one opened the other bottles, and yes they were screwtop, but still. So I opened them. Finally, everyone else arrived. We still only had 4 wine glasses. After trying in vain for several minutes we finally managed to flag down the unfriendly woman and asked for more wine glasses to which she responded, rudely ""We don't have any more."" and walked away. I had to ask three different rude, uninterested staff members for wine glasses and managed to finally get another few but still, not everyone ended up with a glass. Seriously Anyway, the bruschetta came out. While the menu offers a lof of different ones, they are all so deplorably bland and under-seasoned that they felt unfinished. The fig, marscapone and prosciutto should have been good but the poor pig that gave its life was disgraced. Dry, flavorless. Most of the bread pieces weren't even cut all the way through so we were all man-handling the pieces to get them apart. The bread was obviously just grocery store bread and I doubt anything is truly hand-made. The issue is, the quality of their ingredients sucks. They obviously buy the cheapest grocery store crap they can and then mark it up. Everything, even the apples on one of the bruschettas were lacking in any real flavor when they should have been tart and crisp instead of dull and mealy. And as for a wine bar Seriously. A joke. They have a half of a sheet of paper, one side, as their wine list. No flights, no tastings. But for the audience it attracts who are easily impressed by over-priced glop and wine in a trendy area, they'll continue to do just fine. I will never be back.

"I try to like you Postinos, I really do but you make it so hard.  Came on a Tuesday for their 8 PM $20 Bottle of wine and bruschetta special and left disappointed and annoyed.The parking lot disaster strikes again!  LGO now put up signs saying 25 min parking for LGO customers only and has a lot monkey stationed to chase away people trying to park in those spaces.  I was told by the lot monkey that I could valet ($3 charge) or I could park 3 blocks away if I didn't want to pay the fee.  Keep in mind this is a Tuesday and I have to pay to park my car because the restaurant blocks off all the spaces.Once seated my friend and I tried to catch up for a moment when the server came over to take our drink orders.  Since we had just sat down we asked for some time to take a look at the menu.  Our server came back a few minutes later and asked if we were ready to order.  No suggestions on a wine, no questions if we had questions, just ""you ready to order""We ordered a bottle and bruschetta and our waiter disappeared.  For the rest of the night.  I watched him refill wine glasses at other tables, ours was brought by another server.  Other tables had their plates cleared when they were finished, ours sat in front of us until another server took them away.  Our server obviously didn't want our business because about an hour after we sat down he came back to the table and asked if we were interested in any dessert.  We said no and he immediately dropped the check on the table and left.  No offer of another round of drinks, just here is your check.The wine we had was amazing and was a steal at the price plus the bruschetta.  The bruschetta themselves were half assed.  3 of the 4 weren't even sliced all the way through but over all they were decent.Yet again Postinos shows they want my money but not my patronage.  I don't understand how I am the only one who keeps having horrible experiences here

"I totally 100% agree w Serianna T.I have felt the same way about the seating, and parking and mediocre foods... Postino and LGO are complete cluster F***s for anyone who plans on driving there. I also feel like the general atmosphere is trying so hard to be relaxed and casual that it is stressful for the guests.

"Ahh Postino Wine Bar... Or is it Postinos Or Postino Wine Cafe Whatever! I would definitely consider myself a Postino expert. Postino was a go to for countless dates of mine. I have been to all of the locations and my experience at this location has unfortunately changed. When I first stated going to this Postino I loved it! Me and my roommate would visit every Sunday religiously. We always got great service! Food was fantastic and timely. But it seems as if the the 40th street location is either under new management or just has new rude employees. I no longer go to this location because of a couple negative encounters with servers. I had no idea it was there business how many women I take on dates there. You would think the business would be appreciated. I was shocked when a server made a snide comment about my dating habits right in front of a lady friend. I would have been pretty pissed if that was an actual date. Very unprofessional staff at this location!I recommend going to the newer Central & Camelback location if you are planning on visiting Postino. Pros:- cheap tasty bruschetta- reasonable wine prices- decent beers on tap- crazy fast but borderline annoying water refills- short wait timesCons- rude servers- shallow menu- bad for taking dates

"Went yesterday for the first time. It gets one star because the food was yummy. Got the choose two- Nine Iron sandwich with Mediterranean salad. Very good. Lost a star because parking is horrible despite the free but really not free valet parking. Lost a star because I do not like eating up. Meaning the table was so low you have a lot of distance to the mouth and more opportunity to spill. Lost a star because I don't like eating in my living room. Why are restaurants now making their dining room a living room If you want to do the sofa and chair thing do it outside. Not fond of high tops either. Lost a star because they opened the garage door. We chose to sit inside for a reason. They opened it and all of a sudden it was 60 degrees.

"Be warned gluten.... Went for happy hour expecting to have GF food. Postinos said they could do gluten-free before we were seated.Come to find out they could only do olives truly gf once they found out it was a true allergy. We were told by several different people that many items were gluten free; such as the sandwiches, but upon further questions about the meats, cheeses, etcetera being GF, they took back their reassurances. Close call to being poisoned!

"This place is a joke if they think they compare to any sort of respectable wine bar. If this comment offends you, feel free to pull down your pants and start crying now. After looking over what I would consider the 'Cliffs Notes' version of a wine list (BS on calling yourself a wine cellar), we chose a bottle of the ONEHOPE Red Cab. I was happy to learn that half the proceeds went to the cure for Autism until i realized that the waitstaff could have used the money, as they all had some special needs of their own. In an attempt to move past the mediocre start to the evening we moved on to the food menu.  The TomatoBasilMozzarella bruschetta had no basil (wtf), the Orzo and Shrimp starter lacked the red onion it so desperately needed to be a success and who in their right mind serves their pizza on oversized crackers Just because you throw something 'fancy' on the menu like duck confit doesn't mean you have a license to lack on quality. Thankfully the music became the highlight of the evening. If it weren't for the 2-man, live band playing a lively rendition of MyGirl in the corner, I don't know if we would have survived the evening ;)

"I am the co-organizer of a Meetup.com group comprised of African women. My group organizer and me found a website listing 2013 dates for free wine tasting. I called the bar to confirm the days of the week and time for wine tasting about two months before the event was posted. The day of the event, I called as instructed before with the total number of attendees. There were fifteen in our group that day. Soon after arrival,  I asked the waitress when the wine tasting going to start. The waitress told me the days of the wine tasting were held during the week. Of course, a wine tasting was not schedule for the day the Group visited the My Wine Cellar.The owner, an Asian woman came over and shared with me and members of the group, ""...You should have called... did you find the information about the wine tasting on my website....."" This was the extent of the owner's response until I found the website with the information about the wine tasting on my smart phone. The owner looked at the website. I pointed out the information on this site was more recent in publication than The Wine Cellar website. She responded again with the same statements as before and walked away. The feedback from the group was consistent. Members of the group as well as myself were irritated at the owner indifference. The owner was aware of the information out there about her company language used... thus response, ""Did you find the information about the wine tasting on my website....."". The waitress was very helpful and apologized, the owner did not. The owner put the blame on me... ""You should have called. I have been an organizer of a Meetup group and I called before..."" I did.A member of the group went to the owner to share her dismay at the indifference. One of the owners replies from the conversation included, ""So tell me... what do you want for free..."" Yup! Nice! The owner sent over a bucket of wine with no glasses. We ended up using water glasses that were left at the table from when we were first seated. We were there for two hours making the best the situation. The average bill ranged from $15 to $60. The group will not come back to The Wine bar. This review will be posted everywhere it can be posted. By the way the food was okay and the drinks prices average.

"I really, really wanted to like this place. We've given it 3 shots but our experience has been consistent. The first time we stopped in for dinner on a busy evening and sat on the patio. We really enjoyed our wine and tapas meal but our server was incredibly inattentive and we had to chase her down every time we wanted anything. I brushed that off to a really busy night so we returned for a second visit. This time it wasn't that busy so we enjoyed a nice bottle of wine and food. Again, a really inattentive server. When we wanted to check out we literally had to go find her. 3rd try - stopped in for a glass of wine in the early evening. Unfortunately the 3rd visit was the worst. I asked the server if they had happy hour specials and she informed me that yes and we had just made it with 10 minutes left. When we were ready to order we couldn't find her anywhere so went to the bar hoping to make the happy hour deadline. She then came to the table and took our order. 30 seconds later she comes back telling us ""Sorry, you missed the cut-off for happy hour"".....yeah, we missed it because you never came back! Grrrr......We received our wine and waited for our food (we only ordered two really simple appetizers)...and waited....and waited. No one came by so we went up to the bar again to ask about our food. When our server came back she said sorry but our deep fryer broke today and we had to run out to Kohl's and buy a little fryer and that big table was ahead of you. Seriously It's bad enough that they are cooking with a Fry Daddy but never never tell your customers something like that.  After 40 full minutes we received our appetizers, our wine glasses empty. No, she didn't ask if we wanted another glass. She then came back to tell us that her shift was over but no worries, that other girl will take care of you. ""That other girl"" never came by....ever. We had to go up to the bar once again and ask for our check. I fully expected a discount because of the fiasco but no. Not even an apology. So I told them our experience and the manager came over. She said she was happy to take off one appetizer. Great. Except she talked a little too long about all the problems they were having in the kitchen today. So we waited for our revised bill....and waited....and waited. Are you kidding me We had to go up to the bar to get the check. It's a nice little wine bar with pretty good food but 3 strikes and you are out. We will not return here. Very unfortunate for us and them.

"A bit frustrated as we drove all the way over here to meet some friends. Our friends were at the bar waiting for us but there was a lady at the door not allowing us in because they someone was having a 'rehearsal dinner.' They put a sign on the front door, 'we've reached maximum capacity' and that was just tacky. If you're having a private party or special event, turn off the OPEN sign and put a sign up that says Private Event Tonight.

"I use to go here once or twice a week when it was a hole-in-wall pizza joint and the owner worked there everyday.  Really good pie and service. It had a perfect pizza joint atmosphere too. Then they got really popular, expanded, hired more help, churched the the place up and raised the prices. I stopped going when I had two back to back experiences with bad food and bad service. The last time I went there was for a large pie and my bill was $40. Now  Costco's pizza is better and a whole lot less expensive.

"Alright, what am I reviewing here I wish I was reviewing the decor, which is sleek and very cool. The service which was great, the wine which in this area is incomparable....but I'm not reviewing any of that, I'm reviewing the shrimp scampi pizza, and the linguini with white clam sauce, one of which gave me the rumblies in my tummy, which would not go away until I ""moved"" them out. So yes this review comes from the bowels of my hear...well no, just my bowels. You made them very unhappy. I give you 10 stars for the decor and the wine bar itself, but on the seafood, my bowels give you -9. Insert mad face here...the bowels, not me. It actually tasted pretty good going down.

"This used to be a favorite place of mine. The service standards have gone downhill quite a bit. One example is I waited 10 minutes for a refill on iced tea, at the bar. The food is still outstanding, but I think I will take my hard earned money to Sal's Gilbert Pizza. You have truly let me down Pesto's.

"Never again.  terrible service, average pizza, ho hum wine list.  Took forever to get a glass of wine, never heard from the server after she dropped the pizza on the table.  AND the bill was unbelievably high for the quality of the food.  Server never asked us if we wanted another glass of wine or offered us dessert.  Don't go - There's nothing to like about this place.

"I am not one to complain about my food but my clam pasta dish was so salty when the waitress asked me how everything was I had to say something. She was very nice and offered me another dish but I declined. Then the owner came over and seemed pissed I complained about the food and then when she asked my wife why she did not want to take her calamari home she told her it was kinda bland but not to worry about it she got  even more pissed. Then the owner said ""well I brought you a cannolli I hope it is not to salty or bland for you"" and walked away. My wife and I where open mouthed, I will never return after being treated like that. If you do NOT want to hear how the food was from the customer then don't ask. I also think the owner was drinking and maybe that's why she was so mean. I run a business of my own and if I ever heard of one of my employees talking to a customer like that I would fire them on the spot.

"Attended a private wedding reception on Saturday afternoonevening.  BAD EXPERIENCE!! (with the alcohol part)  I don't know what was charged to the wedding couple but it was a rip-off.  Money was given for open bar (a limited amount) and a certain amount was supposed to be held for the wedding party. (about 12)  Lots of guests arrived before the wedding party and the bartenders had pretty much burned through the bar tab limit BEFORE the wedding party arrived!  Brand drinks were cash bar and my wife and I have our preferences so I paid out of pocket for ALL of our drinks (should have helped with the rest of the guests...BUT)  Anyway, the bar closed off the 'tab' way too early.... I think they just double-billed and ripped us off.  At my arrival, I ordered 2 drinks and was charged $18.50 (plus tip)..... 45 minutes later I ordered two more OF THE SAME DRINKS.... CHARGE: $19!!  45 minutes after after that... I ordered the same 2 drinks AGAIN.... charge: $21.50 (before tip) Now.... howwhy did the price increase from $18.50 to $21.50 in the course of an hour and a half Unless it was a rip off  (several complaints heard about weak or NO ALCOHOL mixed drinks at $9 apiece) The dance floor was ok.  The conversation nooks were good, but I don't like to be taken advantage of.  Complaining at a wedding reception makes you look like a jerk.  Soooo, I'm telling you now.... I will never go there based on this first and last exposure to this  place.  You'd think they'd try to impress folks at a special occasion like this so those of us might go back on our own.  Instead.... why would I go EXPECTING to get screwed

"Thanks sunset club for putting me through hell.  My friend and I decided to stop in after Tyber was beat.  The first thing that sucked was the cover was expensive for such a small club ($20).  The DJ was probably the only good thing in here. We decided to get some drinks and had fun dancing and mingling with some ladies, but at the end of the night is where hell hit. I went to close out my tab and my tab was $97 for 3 beers.  I told the bartender she must have made a mistake. She goes, oh its not a mistake.  Some black guy was using your card and purchased 5 bottles of champagne and this tab.  The card got declined ( thank god somehow) after he tried to swipe it for the 5th time in an hour and he left. Basically the bartender gave my debit card to another guy! The manager came out and and the bartender explained then that she handed my card to another guy and he was using it all night.  I told her to cancel out all the charges because the liability falls on you.  She said no.  I ended up calling the cops and when she spoke to the cops her story changed. She said that the bartender never gave my card to him and that he must have been using my name.  The cops then told me to dispute with the card company because it wasnt getting anywhere.  3 months later my case is finally closed and I have my $500 back.  Eff this place.

"Very disappointed.  They no longer have shows in the big theatre where the big stage is.  Instead, bands perform in a large space adjacent to the large and torn down theatre. There's a bar where you can buy overpriced drinks.  Beers were $5.  There's no place to sit to watch the bands. Everybody stands.  The men's bathroom reeked of urine.  The current management doesn't get it.  People heartily supported this place when the big theater was in operation.  We drove from 45 miles away and were utterly disappointed. The acoustics in the new space are awful.  The band sounded muffled.  Fortunately, the Dog Bar was a block away and it was easy to comfort our disappointment with some canine friends.

"Greedy monks. All I can sayRequires a minimum of $50 per person for ""donations."" On major holidays they won't even supply plates and utensils for the people to eat the food. They YELL at you. I grabbed a paper plate from somewhere and this woman snatched it back and gave me a stink eye. Monks are always seen at casinos gambling. I used to work at Coach Inc. (purse store) they would go in and shop all the time. Now I saw them at apple buying 2 iPads with our donation money. Screw this corrupt place and their corrupted monks. They don't even follow the rules of Buddhism. This place is a joke.

"Excellent cheese selection.Beautiful homemade pasta and sauces...I can't say enough about how good every single sauce I have tried is, served with their perfect pasta. I've had to edit my review of Pasta & Provisions for one simple reason. Their store is so unorganized, and their staff so lazy and unmotivated that it is a chore to try to shop there.I can't remember the last time I went to their store that all of the items that I purchased made it home in my bag. They will randomly leave out at least one item every trip.I don't know if this is an effort to increase their profits by stealing from their customers, or if their front counter staff are just that incompetent. But, even with a concerted effort, I still end up at home unpacking my bag, wondering how exactly that I don't have the bread I purchased, or the cheeses, or the ham... or whatever it is that they have charged me for that they didn't put in the bag.Don't try to call to complain either! There is NEVER any management or owner there, and you will talk with a high school aged person, who doesn't know and doesn't care.

"I was so excited about finding a place in Charlotte that sells fresh pasta and sauces.   We were greated with questions about where we parked our car and if we were coming in the store or restaurant next door.  Walked inside to be greated with head banging music that made me want to stab my ears out.  Found a freezer full of sausage with the sell as date of 424 (three days ago) frightening.   Go to the counter to find no fresh ravioli (all frozen) also all frozen Capavetti and Gnocchi.  All types of sauces are also frozen, except one. The kid at the counter is explaining to be how frozen ravioli is better.  Whatever.  The display had a sign for three types of Focacci,  I asked for 2 of the 3 no luck.   I bought the rosemary Focacci and it's sold warm and it's not bad.   I also decided to try a frozen Florantine ravioli and frozen Gnocchi.   They packed the warm bread in the bag on top of the frozen pasta.   Unbelievable.   I will report back on the quality of the half defrosted pasta after I cook it.  Very disappointed in this place.

"Was sold a vacuum sealed bag of grains in a brew kit chock full of insects. When I called ( admittedly 3 months later) the owner said it was my fault I had not used the grains soon enough because the insect eggs were already in the grains. Really    I didn't argue because I had waited, but when I asked him over he phone if he would prepare me another bag as I was driving down to the store,  he gave me a long sarcastic sigh and told me I would have to wait because he couldn't  drop everything and deal with my problem!When I got the store 5 minutes later, no customers were there and the owner wouldn't show his coward face. One of the more helpful employees mix up my bag and I paid him and that is the last money they will ever get out of me.

Does the account number on the check match the account number on the screen  Why should it, those computers are always making mistakes.Now that we have verified that all the information is correct, we can process the payment.  The customer will be so happy that we didn't have to bother them with any silly questions.******I am sad to say that this is an actual occurrence.

"What has happened to the East Liberty Home Depot  It used to be my ""go-to"" place for everything DIY, but no longer.  I stopped by yesterday to pick up about nine items, all of them basic home improvement supplies: cabinet handles, tension rods, quarter round molding, etc.  I came away with NONE of it.  Everything we wanted was OUT OF STOCK!  When I asked if I could order it and have it delivered to the store (to save the shipping costs) I was told that the items I wanted were not ""qualified"" for delivery to the store.  ""When will the items be restocked""  ""Don't know.""  ""Would it be possible to get the items delivered from another store in the region""  ""No, that 'messes with' our inventory controls.""  Oh, but I was told I could haul my sorry butt out to Monroeville where the stock of everything I wanted was plentiful.  Really The staff I dealt with could not have cared less about helping me.  Maybe because it was a holiday (New Year's Eve).  Dunno.  Don't care.  Customer service should not ebb and flow based on the daydate.  The East Liberty HD used to have shelves full of product and plenty of choices.  And the staff was helpful and eager to engage with customers.  No longer.  It appears that the company has given up on the location and is letting it die a slow and painful (for its customers) death.  VERY disappointing to me.

"I used to live in the area and would always patronize and recommend this business.  However with the last experience I will have to rethink that. My aunt and uncle ordered a gift basket for my grandmother for her birthday. When it was delivered it looked beautiful.  However once opened not so much.  Inside it was filled with....Dollar General brand goods. When I stopped down to tell them the owner and another worker told me what do you expect. If it was a busy season we would have gotten stuff from the strip. So moral of the tale. If you want to pay a whole lot of money for stuff from the Dollar Store you know where to go. To make it even more special the owner will provide a blank stare and a warm welcoming attitude that clearly shows she does not care.

"I've gone to Rollier's a lot over the years whenever I needed a personal touch - something you can't get at places like Home Depot.  Last week I went in with a busted window screen frame.  I wanted to replace it, and Rollier's has built replacement screens for me in the past.  For some reason, this time, MT in plumbing was determined to repair my frame instead of sell me a new one.  He told me that my frame hardware was actually thinner than what he had to sell and it wouldn't fit.  (Later I determined that not to be true - its the same size.)  He said instead he could put a brace across the frame.  OK I said.  I'm always open to saving $50+.  Well that brace added at least 18"" thickness to the frame.  Now it won't fit.  If he was concerned that a new frame would not fit, why would he think this very thick brace would  I had to remove that brace to get the frame back on the window.  So he wasted my time, probably over 2 gallons of $4gallon gas, and took $25.67 from me.   So much for the personal touch.  I think I will stick for the impersonal honesty of Home Depot for now on.

"Poor horrible quality! Half of the things are at the end of their shelf life and some are even beyond that- basically some of the things are already gone bad that they are selling. Good luck returning things as the old lady will go psycho on you and start screaming...haha what a joke! I feel pity for them and anyone who might get an experience like I did when i tried to return honey that they sold me which was already bad, probably due to poor temperature control they have in their shop. In summers they rely on air coolers and you can imagine AZ 110 degree days. You would feel like you just walked in a oven....The old lady (owner) is rude and has no etiquettes of how to deal with a customer....I would recommend never walk into that shop or learn from your own bad experience. I wasted my time, money and had bad experience that is going to stick with me for quite some time. Feel bad for other single owners as she is representing them in the worst possible way. For the first time I realized some of the good things that big chains offer. Sorry for being so verbose...but she made us and my wife real upset!

But it was my turn to pay for lunch, so I couldn't tell them to stuff their forty-seven bucks and walk out. This place is in the middle of BFE, with nowhere else to eat except the desert, and I don't care for cactus or rocks...so I sucked it upand did the only thing I could do under the circumstances.I sat there eating my lunch....fixating on how I'd just blasted through one fifth of my unemployment check on a fucking turkey sandwich.

"Hello,And I hope this review does exactly what I intend for it to do. Get the principals of this joke for a restaurant,  who ever they are,  to read it and wake up. Obviously they must be eating the dog food they have been fed by others who rave about this place.Let's start at the beginning, went for lunch, walked in, saw people at tables so waited to see if an employee would be directing us. NOPE!! nothing of the sorts, walked up to an outdoor menu over a entrance, again what do I do next People inside look at you but don't ask to help you. We had our dog with us, so I asked my girlfriend to go in and see what she can find out. She walked to the counter and again no one would help. Can I order Then a person replied and pointed ""you start down there"" Okay great, were getting somewhere. She placed an order for a salad (pre-made crushed into a small container) a chicken salad sandwich and a lemonade. she came out and handed me the salad and drinks and said ' let's find a table, I have to go over to another area to wait for the sandwich""  I sat down at a table with our dog outdoors next to  32nd street (This is a farm) and she went to get the sandwich.  OH the daymare has just started. After about 20 minutes, she sent me a text and said,"" I haven't left you, still waiting"" This is Chicken Salad People!!! slap it on the bread add some lettuce and tomatoes and it's ready to go. Here's where it gets really good, several people who arrived after us are getting their food from the mystery window by the red umbrella. My girlfriend has now been standing there 30 minutes waiting, she taps on the window and asks "" is there a problem with the chicken salad.""  ""I'll check""  the window closes and 10 minutes later the window opens revealing the sandwich.  Now I would say this is possibly a one off scenario except right before she received our sandwich another person who had been waiting said he was on 37 minutes, and then another person came up while she was receiving her sandwich and said ""how long does it take to get a tuna sandwich"" he had been waiting 30 minutes.We eat what I would say is ordinary fresh food, nothing to write home about, and because I found the concept of standing and waiting 40 minutes to get an average sandwich so ridiculous, I stopped back in to express myself and politely said  ""This is our first time here and your service was awful and we will never return""Their response, exactly like the whole experience started. NOTHING.And although we typically know what items cost before we eat anywhere, so initially the price seemed okay but this place is definitely OVERPRICED.

"Run, don't walk, away from Carmel Family Physicians!I've been a patient of CFP for about 3 years.  I've never really been happy, but as I've been looking to leave the area, I hadn't pursued another doctor until now.  By far the biggest problem they have is their phonesupport staff.I certainly don't expect CFP to diagnose me over the phone, but if I contact them for a follow up on an appointment I had, it's like pulling teeth to get a call back.  Calls typically take multiple business days to be returned - if they are at all.  This includes the time that I was in pain to the point I was spending 12 the day in bed.  Or the time I was traveling and forgot my prescription, and asked for a small quantity to be prescribed as I was 2000 miles away from the only bottle I had.  I've even called and spoken with management about not getting timely callbacks, but nothing has changed after months!Their patient referral service isn't any better.  I've been called and ""told"" by their staff when my referred appointment was - without any input from me on what fits my schedule.  I've tried asking them for the name of the doctor so I can make my own appointment, only to be told they don't have that and only the referral person does.  Or the time I was in pain making it impossible to leave bed, and the only doctor they could refer me to didn't have any appointments for 1.5 months - and they had no other suggestions on where to go.  The final straw was when I inquired about a preventive medicine for me.  The response I was given amounted to ""I've heard of that, but I don't know enough about it to be comfortable prescribing it.""  There was no willingness for the doctor to research and follow up to me.  He couldn't even recommend a specialist who was familiar with it - and this wasn't an experimental treatment - this was a relatively new, but manufacturer-recognized use of a 10+ year old medicine.I don't think I've ever felt that CFP was customer-focused.  Rather, when I go there, I feel like I am viewed as a ""necessary evil"" for them to collect their money.  Don't go here - you will regret it.

"I am shocked over these reviews. I'm going to have to assume its family or something. I was an unfortunate victim of this group of GPs for years. Because of the long list of the things I needed to see Dr. Lyndo for (no longer there) I felt like I couldn't go anywhere else.  I honestly felt trapped.This is the wonderful help i've gotten.Dr Daveys sat outside the examining room talking on the phone about his upcoming vacation for well over 15 minutes while I listened. It had only been an hour wait getting in to examination room.The receptionist are the biggest bunch of rude obnoxious.......they have just about done everything but give me the finger. I can't tell you how many times my insurance company didn't ante up so they will call you up to the front of the waiting area and in front of EVERYONE ask about it and ask quite rudely. Then tell me they ""tried"" to call  so I deserve being called up to the front of the class. So embarrassing, especially when your sick. They even called me up when my husband (who had a different insurance plan) had not paid. AND told me I couldn't see the DR because of it! Thats after I had waited fifteen minutes already. I have no idea what I was supposed to do. Go beat up his insurance companyThen there was the time I was prescribed medication that sent me to the ER. Wait no hold on there was the TWO times that medication was prescribed to me that sent me to the ER.And the time they told my son he had loose joints when in fact he had scoliosis. Where you get loose joints from curvature of the spine is anyone's guess. And then when Dr. Bauer accused me of being a smoker, when I told her I wasn't. She told me I was lying....because you know thats what I do. Lie to GP's....Its a bit of a sinful delight for me. I always hope it gets me improved care......oh wait. The long waits where always enjoyable. If I got out of there in less than a hour it would have seemed nothing short of a miracle. You better plan on a lonnnnnng wait. They are making vacation plans after all. I could go on for days. This place is awful. **AWFUL***  Please, go somewhere, anywhere else.  The homeless guy on the corner would probably give you better care. He'd be cheaper thats for sure!

"Absolutely the worst service I have even had in my entire life.  I recently moved here from out of state and was referred to Dr. O'Clair by a coworker.  On my way to the appointment, my GPS took me in a round about way and I knew I would be late so I called ahead. The staff told me that it was not a problem.  I finally got to the office at 4:15 and was asked to sit down. After waiting for another 10 minutes, I was called up to the desk and told that I was MORE than 15 minutes late and had to reschedule my appointment. My appointment was at 4:00, so apparently they cannot tell time.  I explained that I called ahead, got lost and that I was a student who also worked part time so it was very hard for me to reschedule and  the doctor actually refused to see me. The staff was incredibly rude and should have told me not to come in the first place. I left the office in tears out of frustration and embarrassment from the way I was treated. It is clear that Dr. O'Clair has no respect for her patients...as if we have never waited 15 minutes for a doctor before.

"Haven't been to the doctor in 5 or 6 years, so I thought I would go and get checked out.  My insurance covers preventative care 100% and I have a large deductible for sick visits.  I went, had no health complaints, and the nurse told me I was the healthiest person she had seen all day.The practice then billed a sick visit code to my insurance, which applied $130 to my deductible.  I called the billing number, explained the situation, and asked that they bill the prevantative visit code to my insurance.  The billing person told me the doctors pick the code, not the billing people, but he would check with the doctor and call me back the next day.He never called.  I left two voicemails for the billing guy, which he never returned.I appealed to my insurance, who denied because the doctor used a sick visit code.Sooo, my doctor is still sending me bills for the prevantative visit that is covered 100% by my insurance.  The office is yet to explain the ""problem of medium to high severity"" described is the CPT code.  The only diagnosis billed is V70.0, adult well visit.This post is probably more about the billing dept, but still makes me mad.

"They charge an annual administrative fee that is not covered by insurance.  Basically, it's like a credit card annual fee.  This year 2012 it's $60.  I'm not one to pay annual fees at my bank, on credit cards, and definitely don't want to start at my doctors office :(  It's up to you though.

"Well the administration fee is true and now I will not be going back.  You have got to be kidding me.  Like someone stated earlier, I pay a copay every time I go in there and they bill my insurance for anything additional they do.  This is total BS.  I thought I was going to the doctor not a gym.  The Doctors are good there, but it is soooo slow.  If you have a 10am appointment, don't expect to get in before at least 10:30am.I called and I was told this fee was to offset the cost of the Lab, EMR and Patient Portal cost.  I'm not sure what Lab they are referring to because every time I have blood drawn they send it off to some place called LabCorp.  Isn't this the cost of doing business  So should I start deducting a set amount for the employees that work for me for the cost of internet and the payroll system we use  I don't think so.

"I've been a patient of Dr. Wyse for several years. I have always booked my appointments first thing in the morning to avoid waiting in the 'little white room' too long. After the third time of waiting over an hour after arriving at 7:30 in the morning and nothing more than a ""i'm very booked"" as an apology, I've decided it's best to move on and find a new family doctor. There are some rare services or individuals that are worth the extra wait. This, unfortunately, is not one of them. I find it very arrogant when anyone feels their time is more important than yours.

"I have used yelp to find doctors in the past. I found a wonderful doctor through Yelp who unfortunately closed his practice. :(  I can't say strongly enough, use this Yelp review and find another doctor.  I wish I had read the reviews on this practice before I went for my first appointment. It would have saved me a lot of unnecessary stress.

"I was referred to this practice by a colleague of mine. I was very excited to find a ""one stop shop"" family practice where lab and x-ray's can be done in the office, to avoid the troubles of having to go to a lab and wait for the results, then go back into the office. Dr. Sobel is a very personal man. I have no qualms with him. However, my first visit, Jessica, was quite rude and remained so with every visit.  Although I had a scheduled appointment, I waited in the lobby for about 30 plus mins before being walked back, only to wait another 15-20 mins before Dr. Larry would see me. At first I thought it was just an anomaly. However, it was like that every visit, and the office staff was not forthcoming about running behind schedule, and very unapologetic. Yesterday's experience took me over the edge. My appt was at 3:40p.m., I did not get called back into the office until after 4:45p.m. LITERALLY! I had checked in with ""Jessica"" a couple of times to inquire as to why it was taking so long, she said my ""chart was up there and will be called in order"", stating, ""this is Dr. Larry"".  However, I noted some people were called in earlier than I that came in later. I was finally seated in an exam room and waited until 5:14 p.m. before coming out and asking what the deal was. I asked if Dr. Sobel was being over booked or this is how late he runs all the time. They said, ""It's Dr. Sobel"". ""He spends a lot of time with his patient's"". Although that may be a good thing, it should not be at the expense of the next patient.  it is my professional opinion, that if he spends a lot of time with his patient's, then they should schedule accordingly to allow room for that time, instead of making patient's wait an hour and a half to be seen. This kind of management is totally unprofessional and unacceptable. Of note, Dr. Larry Sobel overheard my questioning, and while visiting with another patient, and said...""You can leave if you want"". I left and will not be back again.The courtesy from his staff up front should've been, Dr. Larry is running an hour behind...and allow me the option to reschedule.

Never happy with the staff every time I've gone and this what the icing on the cake.

"Unless it's changed, be forewarned, the staff is unfriendly or rude, depending on your ethnicity, and you can wait up to 1 hour and a half before you finally see the doctor. Although Dr. Larry can be insightful, the staff at the front desk and the wait time, in which they are unapologetic for and do not schedule accordingly, are not worth my time.

"NOTE: The ""Poor"" reviewrating is only for John C. Lincoln Health Network - Saguaro Family Practice facility and staff and NOT for Dr. Mora whom our entire family loves. Dr. Mora is our family doctor. Dr. Mora is incredibly knowledgeable, and getting an appointment to see him is very easy. When you meet Dr. Mora, he always greets you with a hand-shake and takes the time to sit down and actually talk to you about your healthcare needs. It is important to note that Dr. Mora has moved his practice location recently. Dr. Mora used to be with John C. Lincoln Health Network - Saguaro Family Practice group located at 18404 North Tatum Boulevard , Phoenix, AZ 85032, (602) 992-1900. This John C. Lincoln group was atrocious! With the exception of Dr. Mora and his Medical Assistant Erica, the rest of the staff there were terribly rude. Not to mention the office was always filthy which did not make me feel very comfortable going there. (Also you should know that if you call the John C. Lincoln office where Dr. Mora used to work, they will NOT tell you that Dr. Mora has moved. Instead they will try and make you see one of their other doctors there, and I would not recommend any other doctor there to see.) So, I couldn't be happier that Dr. Mora has moved! Dr. Mora now works for Scottsdale Healthcare Primary Care Paradise Valley, 5010 E. Shea Blvd., Suite D100, Scottsdale, AZ 85254, (480) 882-7420. This new location is the kind of doctor office you feel comfortable going to. It is very clean and the staff are very courteous and extremely helpful. If you are new to the valley or looking to change doctors, please consider going to see Dr. Mora at his new practice location. You will not find a better doctor in the valley than Dr. Mora!

"I have been a patient here for my over 6 years, however the many of the old doctors have retired, and their spots have been filled with qualified but uncaring doctors.I made an appointment with the hospital several weeks prior to look at my arm which I believed to be fractured or splintered at the bone.  Two days before my appointment a itchy bacterial rash spread across my back.  On appointment day I was told that I would have to choose between getting a prescription for the infection spreading across my back or them looking at my arm.  Of course the rash took precedence at the time, so 5 minutes and one small little piece of paper after my appointment started I was shuffled out the door--arm still in extreme pain, unacknowledged and ignored by the doctor.Word of advice: If scheduling an appointment here, do NOT schedule with Dr. Luis M Irizarry.  He doesn't care about anything but herding cattle in and out the door so he can make as much money as possible in a given day.

"Just moved to Phoenix, needed a physical for my insurance company for the new year - only required blood pressure, height, weight and cholesterol.  Dr. Walter Kmiecik not only required me to schedule a follow up visit in order to get the form completed (two office visits for one form) but he ordered every single blood test imaginable which cost me $400 in lab work not required by my insurance company.  Then, to top it off, in the follow up appointment he proceeded to act genuinely disappointed when he found that my health was excellent and he couldnt bilk me for more ""medical care"" I didn't need.   This is a crooked, dishonest practice and I would not recommend anyone patronizing them, particularly Dr. Walter Kmiecik.

"Where's the management My husband decided to take me there for a suprise. We arrvied there around 2 pm on a Sunday to a very empty parking lot. We arrived inside to find a large party. There was no direction for someone who has never been there. On top of that, the party had stragglers filter in, so of course they nonchalantly cut in line because they were there for the party. It should not work that way. We found a mix of 2 lines where we had no idea where we were supposed to be. After standing in line for an hour, the couple in front of us approached the counter to find out there was a 2 hour wait for a race. We didn't even wait to get to the counter before we said enough of this. There was no management around and found the laziness of the employees. We were disappointed in this place, but it's not really like one complaints going to hurt this. I just hope they learn how to be more effective at their operations and their customer service. You can train employees how to facilitate operations and when groups are known to come in, have them have a specific point of contact so the rest of us don't have to suffer for because we're not in their group.

I asked about what This person explained 2 separate issues, first another sales person had sold the last seat for the class that I had already made all the travel arrangements for. Second was that the Hotel WAS NOT to be included in the price due to the ""gift certificates"", this is when I was informed that ""they are gift certificates, we don't make any money on them!!"" I was not happy, as stated, I tried to secure the class seat with a credit card the week prior to making travel arrangements. I was told that the person would ""try and figure out a way to fix it."" I canceled all travel and was contacted it a few days by the sales person. I was told that I was going to be able to attend the scheduled date AND upgraded to a Corvette! The main reason for pulling the trigger on the class was because I has recently bought a 2011 Camaro SS and wanted to drive that car. I made that clear from the first contact regarding scheduling a class seat. There is more but frankly I don't feel like going back over all of it..... After not being able to offer ANYTHING to compensate me for ALL OF THEIR ERRORS, I decided to confront the General Sales Manager with a copy of all electronic correspondence regarding ALL of the issues from the beginning. In the middle of the main entrance of the facility AND IN FRONT OF AN EMPLOYEE I was told ""I'm not getting into a battle of emails."" Then slammed the door as they left, leaving me to answer to the employee When stated "" What Just Happened"" I explained that the sales manager was busy.... After gaining my composure, I went and found the same person and asked to see Mr. Bondurant. I was told that he was not on the property and would not return for the day. I TOLD this person I would be expecting a phone call from Mr. Bondurant ASAP due to the flight I had reserved for home I could not wait.""WAIT FOR IT...."" The next day I receive a phone call from the legend Bob Bondurant, the first words from his mouth were ""I'M PRETTY PISSED OFF RIGHT NOW,"" I WAS    FLOORED TO SAY THE LEAST......     After several different people chimed in on the speaker phone, I just gave in. After spending thousands of dollars and going to a ""Bucket List Item"", I had no come back for a person I had looked up to for decades. I had upset Him... Well the dust has settled and I thought it was time to speak my own opinion to this tragedy. THERE IS SO MUCH MORE TO THIS EVENT THAT I HAVE NOT LISTED. The irony to this whole thing is that due to my job I attend MANY events that the Bondurant's do as well. I look foreword to seeing them very soon.Cheers,

"I received a gift certificate valued at $2500 and booking a date was a hassle. I understand you have to book 3 months in advance and I'm ok with that. After calling and waiting to be re-directed to the ""right person"" 4 times, I was sent to a voice mail where I left a message and expected a call back. No return call. This went on for weeks. The gift certificate has an expiration date and i wasn't able to get a hold of ""the right person"" through the phone. What a waste of a gift.

"I took my family here for a birthday party for a friends child. Overall-the kids had a blast. It was very cold and windy so I didn't see my kids wristbands until their hour and a half was up and we went inside. When I went to take the wristband off my 3 year old daughter I discovered that the girl had put it on so tight that it literally cut and bruised her wrist. It took 3 of us to get it off. Needless to say, I was pretty upset. I took my daughter up front where about 10 employees were standing in a circle chatting. I showed them her wrist and one girl asked who did it. I didn't remember so I told them whose party we were attending. The girl, I believe her name was Missy, said it was her and in a very unconcerned tone said "" sorry about that."" My friend went up several minutes later and spoke to them again, including the manager. She said she got the same reaction-not a lot of concern or sympathy. I called and spoke with both owners, Ken and Jerry. Both apologized but didn't seem too concerned. I realize they couldn't change what happened. However, knowing a 3 year old was left with cuts and bruises from a wristband because of one of their employees, I expected a little more concern and empathy. If I had done this to a child, I would feel so awful and do whatever I could to make the child and her parents feel better and know I was remorseful. I really felt like the employee and the owners were annoyed that I was bringing it to their attention. I don't feel they had any remorse whatsoever.
",0
"Had just purchased $80 worth of wrist bands for the rides. Before I could get on a ride with my baby an unsupervised child pushed me & baby out the way. Security was not concerned with me almost falling with a baby but more focused on a profanity that I said. Do not want to spend my money anywhere that isn't concerned about my child's safety.

"The workers here are really rude and mean. When ordering food, the cashier did not know what she was doing asked another coworker and called her ""fcking stupid."" My little 8 year old cousin asked to get her 284 tickets she won from a game but the workers refused and just gave her four tokens back...how rude! She worked hard for this tickets! This is suppose to be a family oriented place but turns out it ain't! NEVER COMING BACK, tbh.

"It's a pretty fun place when not completely  packed. But, i came here today to celebrate my brothers birthday, and the place was practically empty aside from our small group. And they didn't bother to turn on the music , nor did they even open the rides, blaming the weather , no rain. Aside from the girls who brought us our drinks and pizza, the rest of the staff was brand spanking new and far from friendly or talkative. They have a scan Qr that seems you get free tokens upon downloading their App. So I did just that, and apparently they have to give you another code to scan to unlock that, which they couldn't find! I saw they had another code there too for a free slice of pizza and a drink , so I scanned the one code they did have, and when I asked the New girl if I could redeem this one while I was at it, her manager which she called over again , who was very rude and accusing me of trying to use a code twice. Luckily the other girl there who let me scan and unlock the pizza code said I had just done it. He reluctantly gave the green for it. This place is poorly managed and gives off a very dead vibe. You'd think they'd be nicer to their only paying costumes. I won't be coming back again.

"****DO NOT GOTO THIS PLACE!!!****I came here to celebrate a bachelor party with a group of 9 guys and we signed up for the mini grand prix (3 races).  In the first race, 2 karts broke down, 1 kart went only half speed, and my own kart had a sticky gas pedal with a broken steering wheel brace.  Most of the karts didn't have functioning seat belts either.So after the first race they tell our group that they only have 5 functioning karts left and that we'd have to split our group up, even though I made a reservation in advance and they guaranteed us we'd all be able to race together.  You'd think they'd have some backup karts  Anyways, we demanded a refund right there and then but the managers AND owners absolutely refused to talk to me, even over the phone!  They told their own staff that the invoice for the reservation stated ""NO REFUNDS"", but they never sent me an invoice.  I called the day before to remind them to send me the invoice again but they failed to do so.  For the next 2 hours our group argued with the administrative staff who claimed they could do nothing to help us without manager consent.  I had the admin there pull up their copy of the invoice that was never emailed to me, and even their copy said nothing about ""NO REFUNDS"".The staff there kept calling their managers, and eventually even the managers stopped picking up their phone calls!  How shady is thatBottom line: STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!

"This place sucks.  The kart I had went about 10 mph, not the claimed ""50 mph"" on their website.  The kart was so slow I was able to drive around the entire track full throttle and one handed while maintaining my line.  people were lapping me and it was pretty disappointing.  What made it more disappointing was that they said there was nothing they could do because only 4 or 5 karts were operational so some of us were stuck using karts with known problems.  They wouldn't even give me a refund after this ordeal.  I DO NOT recommend this place.  highly unprofessional and unsatisfied.
",0
"Just awful, personnel were helpful, but the service was terrible. Owner is not responsible at all. He lacks ownership qualities when it comes to dealing with people was not respondent . Also note that there is no refund even though they don't tell you beforehand. Cars are liable to break down at anytime without notice and there cars about five years old. Would highly suggest not to even give this place a try your better off going elsewhere.

"If you know anything about Go-Karting, do NOT go there. For one, the staff was very rude, don't acknowledge you upon arrival, not even the manager. The rules were not enforced at all. They put you in a room where they just say watch this video where people just walked out to the track just to ignore it. Nobody makes sure you watch the video, just leave you in a room that you can easily walk out. On the track, there was just one guy, not caring at all that was happening on the track not knowing what he was supposed to do. Flags weren't used when trying to pass, he walked off at times mid-race more focused on a girl.  He used the YELLOW flag which means CAUTION to end the race instead of the CHECKERED. My sister spun out and I passed her 4 laps before he came back and realized she was out of the race. Did I mention the Go-Karts were horrible This is my 5th go-kart place and by far the worst I've been to. If you have kart experience, DO NOT come here!

"We went this last weekend, bought it through groupon.And I have to say my family felt like we were imposing on them. I called to see if there needed to be reservation and the gal that answered was very short. And it almost sounded like she was trying to discourage us to go.Once we arrived, we walked into a small lobby and the same gal that answered the phone was the  receptionist and she didn't bother to look up in greeting or greet us. Rather she was quite rude and said ""What!"" she wasn't very anything except rude. spoke under her breath and yelled at people. So, beware of the receptionist with two surface piercing on her collar bone. We weren't given any direction with anything. Just kind of wondered through. We had to wait 3 hours for our first lap and they seem to have forgotten our party. One of the employee was smoking while working and walked out to help move a go kart that was stuck with his cigarette in hand. my dad and my boyfriend didn't have a seat belt, well there was straps but no where to click them into. No safety enforced, no instruction, and no customer service. Overall, it was horrible. We paid for three races and a year membership. We only did two and the only reason we did the second was we went up and asked why its taking them another 2 hours to get our second race in. And when we inquired about the year membership, no one knew what that was. And no one cared really.

"Worst gokart experience of my life. The lady at the front is nice, cool. But after that is completely unprofessional.  They leave you in a room to watch a short instructional video which is complete SHIT. They state the obvious like ok red is stop green is go. Dont press them at the same time blah blah.  They also tell you about what flags mean which is usefully, IF THEY ACTUALLY USE THEM.  The management inside at the track is horrible, the entire time i was there they were on their cell phones or playing with their man tits.  I watched two races go by, and as people had spun out, waited patiently with their hands raised, waiting for assistance, the track workers sat there with their hand down their pants on their phone. The customer sat there waiting for two laps..... As for the rest, be prepared for uneven cars, lack of flag uses.  Bumping Go for it, they dont give a shit. Slow drivers Waste your time behind them, they dont care. Gutless karts This is your place. Anyone who has ever been to a gokart place knows this place sucks. Never going again.

"3 REASONS TO AVOID THIS PLACE1.  The website says, ""Fast Lap races are a true ten minutes on the track!""  --  This is a lie.  We timed all 3 races and each was 6.5 minutes on the button.  What a rip off.2.  The website says, ""The Karts are equipped with Honda 200cc engines which can reach speeds up to 50 mph.""  --  This is a lie.  The karts there are all old and beat to - well, they're bad. Except for 3 of them that actually ripped around that nasty old warehouse at speeds up to 50 mph.Biggest Lie Coming Up3.  The website says, ""Our building's are equipted with state of the art professionally engineered exhaust system's that change the air in our building every 4 to 5 minutes."" -- This is a lie like none other!  If by state of the art, you mean 4 garage doors that are open, then yes, your professionally engineered exhaust system is top notch.  My buddy and I had SERIOUS issues with our throats buring after being in that warehouse for over an hour (Kona Grill's happy hour helped wash down the 4 stroke exhaust that had coated our esophagus - thx Kona).The on track staff is terrbily unprofessional.  The protective jump-suits and gloves are all worn with holes and missing zippersvelcro.  I'll never go back there, and that's coming from a guy with a stack of ""Buy One Race, Get One Free"" cards.Sigh

"This place sucks! We showed up and were told the wait would be an hour and a half. Since there were 20 of us, we were told we could return in 2.5 hours and race. Guaranteed! We found the nearest bar and upon return, we're told it would be another 1.5 hour wait. Lame! So we left and they lost out on $1000!  The girl at the desk sucks on getting and keeping business for this place! Make sure you have reservations and still plan on waiting 2 hours!
",0
"If I could give zero stars, I would. We waited for a LOOOOOONG time and were told we would have to wait another hour if we wanted to race. I should've know better when we showed up and a family was grumbling as they were walking out. Turns out the same thing happened to them. I can't comment on the carts because we decided we had spent enough of our vacation waiting so we left. I will say that the neighborhood is horrible and I wouldn't want my kids anywhere near there unsupervised. Save your money and spend it somewhere that knows what customer service is.

"Would never go here ... very unorganized ... i went in with a group with groupons to get on the track. I understand that we cannot make reservations for a groupon, but the idiot lady told me that we would wait 2 hours and we can get on. We did wait 2 hours then she said another hour .. We were visiting vegas not there to sit in their garage for 3 hours. We even tried to compromise and say alright then just give us one of the three races we are entitled to. One of the worst experiences i ever had. I usually never rate a business a one because things happen, but this lady just made me frustrated. I hope the owner reads this and fires her because she is hurting your business.

"This review is based on their mini-golf and that alone. Everything else looked pretty useless as well but the mini-golf was an absolute joke. They had 3 courses to choose from and all three were very poorly designed and run down like the place has been around for 20+ years. If you want a real mini-golf experience I suggest going to Castles and Coasters.

"Really bad experience.  We prepaid for several batting cage TIS and were told that we could use some the next day if we needed to.  My 9 year old was hit by a wild pitch and we left.  We returned the next day in spite of the mishap and were told by Jason that we could not use our Prepaid tickets from the day before.Their operations director was not available to,speak to me...Sharee Swander.The place is very run down, many of the games don't work and the overall environment is very dirty so bring your gloves to keep away from the germs.We also learned that someone had been seriously burned at the go kart track.Ugh!

"Wow, this place has really gone downhill. This used to be a well maintained, fun place to go when I was in high school. We revisited last week and it was a totally different experience.Batting cages were fun, nets over the cages were torn, so hopefully you're not parked on the other side of them! $1.50 for 18 pitches. Driving range looked like it was in decent condition, but we didn't partake.Now come the negatives--the mini-golf course was a joke. Holes in fake boulders, missing turf, cement lumps, no water, no decorations, no nothin! Horrible! By about hole 5, we were over it and were trying to find our way off the course. We go back to the window, to see if we can do something to make up for the crappiness that was just experienced. Manager comes to the window and has a horrendous attitude! Seriously, we didn't ask for refunds, we asked if we could do something else, to make up for the shoddy course. Not even an option, he was rude and demanded receipts and cards--refunds given (and appreciated).Bathrooms were also pretty disgusting. Certainly won't be going back.

"Well, I'd give no stars, however it won't let me.  No where on the website did it indicate a closure at 4 pm today, 121212. When we arrived, an employee told us that they were closing on short notice, and then said the sign had been up for a week.As tourists visiting from out of town, I would expect a notification on the website.  I am disappointed ( my five year old sorely so) that we were unable to do go karts with him.My advice to the management: please post closures on your website.  There are five year olds that count on that information.  Thank you.

"I had an extremely unpleasant experience at my recent visit to Pole Poistion raceway. My boyfriend and I have been looking forward to our trip to Las Vegas for a long time, Pole Position being one of our top priorities.Unfortunately the faculty were less than friendly, especially the boys running the track area. There were 4 people ejected from my race for accidentally running into barriers. These cars are extremely powerful and fast, and for someone who has never driven one before, it is easy to get out of control. Being a beginner myself, I was the first person to crash, and was threatened to be ejected, and spoken to like I was a dumb child who had never driven a car before. This was demoralizing, not to mention, embarrassing, being that these boys yelling at me we're younger than myself.After my crash, I could hear the boys running the track area saying that their groups of racers were 'stupid' today. Listen boys, if you don't like your job, get a new one. I felt it would have helped to do a slow practice run around the track before each race, being that there are several accident prone areas that come up quickly to someone like me who has never raced the track before.My disappointment in Pole Position has caused me to recommend  NOT going there, and I, myself, my boyfriend, and our friend who went with us will not return either.

"I was visiting Vegas with some friends when I checked this place out. I've been to quite a few go karting places and this was one of the worst. The track is too small for 12-13 karts at the same time. Also, the race managers are not consistent about who they stop for crashing into other karts or the walls...it seems that ""regulars"" get the preference. Give this place a miss.

"This place would be awesome if it would regulate guest who do not follow rules. At the beginning they give you instructions. Problem is especially for those who abuse the pull to the side passing rule are not removed. This company prosecutes customers who are their to have fun and race hard.

Find another place to race because if you have any interest in having fun expect the employees to ignore those who refuse to abide by the rules that make this place fun.

"Time and time again is place seems to have inconsistencies with their policies. When we showed up today, we saw the ""text club"" advertisement. I texted the club and got an offer for a free race. As soon as you take it up to redeem, they tell you it's not good today because it's a weekend. There's nothing in the text that says it's not valid on weekends (see photo of the text below).

"I read the other review and was shocked because my experience was very different. Yes, the temple is clean and open for business but polite and open the priest was not!  I would say people from other faiths sure don't feel welcome when it's only the priest present.  The current temple priest who performed my wedding (I married an Hindu) was RUDE, Rude, rude (had I known this was how it was going to go down I would have used the priest from Bharatiya Ekta Mandir of Arizona).  Sadly we only met in-person (my fiance had several phone conversations the months leading up to out wedding) with the priest the week before our wedding and it was perfectly obvious that he disliked me and my lack of Hindi.  I attempted to ask question to better understand the ceremony but that just got me scowls and grumbles.  The day of our wedding the priest was not ready and was acting as if he had forgotten about the ceremony andor the deposit we made.  Finally, after the ceremony when it was time to sign the marriage certificate he asked (actually demanded) an additional $300 to sign the certificate.  Of course we agreed- what were we to do  I am pretty sure that would be called extortion and why hadn't he simply told us before the ceremony  I am guessing because he is a thief!

"This place is overpriced and the service is not good at all.  When we where there children were riding bikes in the lot near the tables.  One almost hit our child.  Another customer said that if the owner had been there she would have not allowed the bikes to be there.  The cone was large to say the least but the taste left something to be desired.  Not the best neighborhood either with a bar nearby.  Our children were exposed to language that would have made a sailor blush.  We will not be back.  Also they will accept a credit card but not a debit card  Please get up with the times.

The soup had the consistency of milk, and not much flavor.  It's no where close to ""cream of"" anything.   The cheese on the sandwich was so thin that I pried it open just to ensure myself that they hadn't only given me 2 pieces of plain bread.

She ended up passing me off to a guy who put acrylics on my nails. I won't be going back EVER!!  What a joke!!

"I used to love this place and had been a regular client for nearly 2 years. However, they have forever lost my business. Went in for gel manicurepedicure. Took forever and I had to rush out to get to another commitment. Later that evening I was called and told that they made a mistake and had undercharged me. The girl went silent  waiting for my response. I was shocked that they were calling to ask me to come back. I explained that I was leaving to go out of town the next day and she asked where I currently was and if I could come back that night. Could not believe the nerve! When I got back from town I received an additional call. When you make the mistake you eat the cost. I can't think of anything more tacky than telling an existing client who has spent hundreds of dollars at your business to come back and pay. HORRIBLE business practice.  Never going back and will tell others not to waste their time or money at a business that treats clients this way.

"Round and short! It is not that complicated. I was unfortunately very disappointed. They tried to get me in and out in 10 minutes, like really   They tried to just and file my nails and not cut them. After she was done and asked if I liked. I asked if she was going to shorten my nails and she started clipping them with a cuticle cutter. Basically I would never come back and would not recommend anyone to go here.

"I went there because of the high reviews on Yelp. I'm hoping next time someone sees this.RUN AWAAYYYYYYY. This place blows. I wanted to get a full set of acrylics with pink tips, and I explained this and pointed out the tip on the display so the technician knew EXACTLY what I wanted. I had gone with my friend, and we were bouncing around future nail ideas, and the technician decides to listen to only PART of our conversation, and just starts doing something else to my nails based on PART of what he heard eavesdropping, without even asking me.Before I realized what he was doing, he ended up cutting my cuticle so badly we had to use the human version of ""Quik-Stop"" on my cuticle to stop the BLEEDING, it was cut so bad. He did this while using the tool that looks like sharp pliers to remove dead cuticle skin. I don't get my nails done a lot, so I didn't know he wasn't doing tips anymore like I asked. He tried to give me a full manicure with a gel coating over the whole nail, no tips, without even asking me. He got far enough that I had to just have him take off the mess he made so I could just leave since I had work later. He tried to get me to stay and he tried to tell me that after he filed off the gel coat he had applied and then properly got the tips on, it takes 40 minutes to an hour AFTER THAT to put a gel coat on. I understand if the whole procedure; filing, putting on tips, putting on gel coats... that can take 40 minutes to an hour. Just a top gel coat NOT that long of a procedure. He took off the mess he made and I left. I had work to get to, and its rare I get a day off where I have time to do this. He wasted my time, he didn't ever communicate with me, and he took stupid liberties that cost us both. I would not EVER go back.

"The reason for the one star rating is the way they treat their employees (and customers).  One woman wanted to pay with her credit card. They gave her some grief about it, then took it, but kept $1 out of the tip to pay for the credit card transaction!  Then the ownermanager (who was doing my nails at the time) pulled out her bill to show the customer how much she gets charged per credit card transaction.  The customer was like, uh, ok, don't need show and tell here really.  The owner kept saying how this is America, nothing is free, the customer should know that.  Then once that customer left, the owner continued ranting to me and showing me the bill.  I'm not sure which shocked me more--that she fought with the customer so much, or short shifted her employee because the customer used a credit card.  Either way, they could have given me the best manicure ever (they didn't) and I sitll wouldn't go back.  Too much bad juju here.

"This place was AWFUL. I was using the groupon so I had to call to make a reservation for my friend and I. As soon as I told the receptionist that I would be using the groupon, she tried to hang up on me. I told her she hadn't asked for my name yet, and she hurriedly asked what it was and hung up. Fast forward 2 weeks later and big surprise, she had not written my name or my friend's name down for our reservation. Luckily, it wasn't too busy and she had my friend and I sit in her chairs. Worst mistake ever. She started off very friendly; however, I noticed after 2 coats of white gel nail polish that the color on my nails did not resemble the color that i had picked that was on the sample nail set. As soon as I told her this, she told me that the sample nails were already white and that's why the nail polish did not look the same on my nails. False advertising much She then tried to talk me out of having white nails because it would ""look bad"". After trying to convince her that I indeed wanted white nails, she hurriedly slapped on a few coats of white nail polish and went on to do my friend's nails. Worst quality ever. There were bubbles in my polish and a piece of random hair got stuck in the polish. She seemed very annoyed that I asked her to take the random hair out and fix my nail. When she asked my friend what color she wanted for her nails, my friend chose a white gel polish with sparkles, but asked the lady if the color was going to look the same as the sample (not wanting to go through the same hassle I went through). The lady responded by telling her that it was my fault that I wasn't satisfied with the color on my nails originally and that I was wrong. She then proceeded to wrap my friend's nails in foil and use the electric nail filer to take my friend's old nail polish off. She said she would have to CHARGE HER $3 FOR REMOVING HER NAIL POLISH. Her nail polish wasn't even gel or shellac, it was REGULAR NAIL POLISH for goodness sakes! As she was doing her nails, this lady kept muttering, ""Oh my God"" underneath her breath and did the WORST JOB EVER on both of our nails. We would have just gotten up and walked out except we had already purchased our groupon. This was the worst nail experience I've ever had. DO NOT GO TO MAGEN NAIL.

"I used to go to Magen nail salon with my old roommate and thought it was okay (nothing great, but not terrible).  The nail salon is definitely outdated and in use of a renovation, but I could look over that.  The last time I went to Magen's was the last.  I had to have her shorten my nails twice because she didn't go it right the first time.  No biggie.  I did have a hang nail on one toe that she decided she needed to rip out.  It was pretty painful and definitely drew blood.  No apology.  The best part of this all is that my toe was inflamed and really tender for over two weeks.  Very unprofessional and I will never be back.

"Unfortunately, I had a really terrible experience at this salon. I was excited to try a new place for a great price (with a gel manicure groupon) however when I got to the salon, the lady redeemed my groupon on my phone and then immediately claimed no such thing happened. I saw her press the button with my very eyes and genuinely thought this was a bad joke. After I showed her she redeemed it she started arguing with me saying I need to pay again, that my groupon was invalid, and basically accusing me of stealing. I was horrified. She then proceeded to turn to  her coworkers and very obviously talk about me.   It was the most appalling customer service I have ever seen. She went on to make me pay full price for my manicure even though I had a legitimate groupon. I would have left immediately had my friend (who also had a groupon) was not already inside. My friend was serviced by a different gentleman and did not have any  problems. She also simply showed her phone to the person, pressed redeem and went on to get a manicure in peace. We were both extremely appalled at their behavior and the terrible treatment of a new customer.  I am never going back.

"Ok, I'm writing this review after going to this place about 4 times. It is conveniently located near my house so having just moved here I thought id give it a shot since my regular nail place was in Tempe Marketplace and I felt lazy to go there that day. First time, I got a pedi and full set and had no issues. I did notice the quality was lower than the job they had done at my other place but I was ok with it. That particular day they were busy and I think her son and bf were both helping out. It's a family business which I think is great. Second time was a fill and pedi. She seemed to be n a rush and my nails were all sloppy and the clear coat wasn't covering the whole nail, some nails weren't even and  just a sloppy job. She asked me who had done my nails... I told her she had (the owner).Third time, I went in... Same thing... The girl doing my pedi n French tip couldn't get it right.... They were all uneven and almost looked like they used whiteout for the tips. Messy. When the owner started doing my nails she noticed I kept looking at my toes and she offered to take a look after my nails were done. Well. Again, she saw the sloppy work from the previous time and AGAIN asked me who had done my nails... I told her it was her.  She finished and again.... Same thing... Nails not even... Clear coat not covering entire nail and bumps all over. I hate complaining so I just asked she looked at my toes which she did and had the girl redo them... I felt bad. I came back a couple days later cause I broke a nail and I mentioned to her about the clear coat and I showed her... And she fixed it. She also fixed my broke nail and it looked weird cause she did it (again) like always in a hurry and it was not as wide as the other nails. Whatever I left. I went back yesterday (111813) and she meets me at door saying ""oh we too busy"" it's only three of them working.... And I was like ""ok"" (sounded like she was telling me to go!!) I said it's ok I can wait....  Well I should've left!!!! I decided to get my toenails red... That's how bad I didn't want the girl to try doing the French tip! I never paint my toe nails red!! Ever!!! Then (the owner) started looking at my nails and she AGAIN asked me who had done them cause they didn't look good and asked why that broken nail SHE had fixed wasn't as wide as the others!!!!!!! I told her it was herself and she shut up. She honestly seems to be very very lazy and ALWAYS ALWAYS in a hurry. I'm not the type of person that complains but I don't like telling u how to do your job either cause I don't like others telling me how to do mine. But this time... I had had it. I asked her to fix several things... And then she puts the clear coat... And tells me to put my hands n the dryer thingy... Once my nails were done.. I pull them out and she files the edges a bit... And she damages one of the nails n the side taking off the clear coat... I tell her and she said ""oh u did it when u out ur hand down"" SHE WAS STILL HOLDING MY HAND!!!  And then I asked her about three other nails not fully covered with clear coat.  She reapplied and after 2 mins n the dryer thing she said I was done. I looked at my nails and she could see I was upset.  Because she just reapplied clear on too of the other clear that wasn't even dry.. There's bumps and u can see the ridges of the little brush....  I was supposed to get my eyebrows done but i was scared she would just wax it all off... So I told her never mind. As I'm paying she sees I'm not happy cause I keep looking at my nails and she says... ""U ok I fix for u"" I said ""don't worry about it""... I paid.. Left no tip and walked out. I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt but not anymore.Her work is very VERY VERY SLOPPY.... She is ALWAYS is a hurry and ALWAYS understaffed. I would never recommend this place to anyone cause they will be very unhappy with her work. I wished she had more pride n what she does. Being n the customer service field I know that when I'm with a customer... That's my only customer and I concentrate n them and only them. To rush and have a bad product or service is just not good business. If u go there, be ready to wait at least 30 minutes before being seen.

"DANGER!DANGER! ZERO CONCERN FOR CLIENT SAFETY! State board needs to be warned of this place. This place deserves negative stars. They burned the top and side of my foot with callous remover! I have abrasions on my foot that are still there a week later. I am unable to wear shoes or even flip flops because of the pain. The side of my foot also blistered up. They use unsafe practices, and then tried to blame me for having sensitive skin. I went to nail school, and have used various callous removers safely, on myself and others. I do not have sensitive skin.

"I really really hate leaving bad reviews but sometimes they are well-deserved.  The only positive thing I can say is that the ladies who work here are nice.  What was not nice is the completely jacked up gel nails I got when I stopped here on a whim when my regular lady at Luxury Nails was booked.  The bed of each of my nails had crazy white streaks all over when she was finished. When I pointed it out and asked what the heck it was, she acted like there was nothing there.  It was really noticeable so I don't know why she thought this was the best way to handle it.Then the entire staff came over and examined my nails and the lady who seemed like the owner explained that it was my crappy real nails.  Yes.  I have crappy real nails, which is why I get gel in the first place!  But I have never had this happen and I've had gel nails for months.  The suggestion was for me to have each of my nails buffed down to paper thin status and re-apply the gel.  This was done with only some improvement.  I left with my nails looking like complete garbage.  They are not even filed right, so even if I was going to buy the argument that this little situation is somehow the fault of my genetics, it does not explain not even filing the ends properly.  Do NOT go here for gel nails!

"This shop does not even warrant a rating. I called on a Monday morning. Explained to the guy on the phone that I was looking for a new nail lady. I made an appointment with the owner Jennifer on Tuesday evening for a gel manicure. When I arrived on time she comes out then passes me off to someone else. Said she was too busy. Which she had no clients and was just sitting there. I explained my previous bad experience at another salon and she said Victoria would take good care of me. Victoria was nice and My nails looked decent when I left. not 24hrs passed and three nails chipped. Then I went back Wednesday night and showed Jennifer the nails she said she would fix then passed me to another lady who proceeded to drill my nail to remove all the gel. I told her to stop and explained it was soak off gel. The lady did not understand. Jennifer identified the commotion then came over. I explained the drill and she told the girl. I was so frustrated at this point and Jennifer finally agreed to correct and work on me. I told her to forget it and I would do it myself. All my nails broke and chipped. I was so disappointed with the experience I had. I am a loyal customer and just wanted quality service. I will never patronize this store ever and would advise anyone seeking quality to look else where.

"I hate writing bad reviews but I wasn't very impressed with this place for the prices they charge. :( All was not lost though since I had printed out a coupon from their website for 20% off. The pedicure stations don't have massage chairs and I didn't think my manicure was as clean and nice as it could have been. The lady who did my nails was super nice but I don't think I'll be returning to Total Bliss unless it's for a different kind of service.

"Meh. I went here for an appointment with Anastasia for gel and glitter. I waited patiently and ended up with an appointment with a completely different person than what I was told I was going to see. I asked her I wanted gel with glitter and she had no idea what I was talking about. She said she can do gel polish with glitter in it but not any type of loose glitter with gel. The lady they gave me only does regular acrylic nails and was even too afraid to do the glitter as she didn't know what she was doing. Finally another lady said that she can do it but that i would need to wait a moment until she's finished with the appointment. I waited a half an hour and finally saw the lady. I did not realize that she was pushing me in between her appointment and she did it very quickly, maybe lasted about 20 minutes. I have never had my nails done that only takes 20 minutes. She ended up using a shellac gel instead of an actual gel builder. And it was very clumpy and uneven, to were you could see a dip in the middle of each of my nails. The only reason I'm giving it any stars is that the owner was very apologetic and tried to accommodate the situation, but I was disappointed. Also, I had went there with a spa finder gift card. I had $10 left. instead of just taking the money off of that card and giving me the card to go somewhere else, the receptionist traded it for a total bliss card. This now, forces me to have to go back to them just use the rest of the card.

"This was the worst, least professional spa service I've ever received. The girl waxing my brows talked at me the entire time, so much so that I wondered whether or not she could possibly be focusing on what she was doing. After 15 minutes, spewing out of a partial life story and some pretty horrific gum smacking inches from my face (all on HER parth, ha), my brows were ""done."" They were decently shaped (nothing special) but the clean up was atrocious. I had errant hairs that I had to request my esthetician pluck and she did (while I stood up). However, when I got home, I still had to clean up myself. Bad, bad, bad and it cost twice as much as any perfectly decent salon wax. I wish I'd had something even NEAR the experience other yelpers have had.

"After having experiences from Laura and Lisa from the Brow Lady and awesome customer experience from both of them, I am now sad to say nothing here is the same as it was before. On my last visit, I was scheduled with Sharmeita (someone who had only been hired two days prior to my brow wax). While she did an amazing job with my eyebrows, she lacked in customer service. She pretty much did everything wrong you could do while in a customer service position. She gossiped about the people there, the company drama, and the company itself. She even told me the rude things she would say to a customer if they asked a ""stupid"" question. I would have been extremely happy if my waxer would have good customer service skills, but unfortunately not and I will NEVER come back to this company (AND I GAVE THIS PLACE SEVERAL CHANCES TO REDEEM ITSELF AFTER LISA AND LAURA LEFT). Pleaseeee take heed if you are considering coming here, there are much much much better places in Scottsdale that will treat you better than this place now. I will definitely be following Lisa to her own shop now.

"Ungood!!! I went in for a follow up brow wax; 1st one wShar was ok. No big complaints, no rave reviews. My 2nd encounter wShar was a brow clean-up & then I got talked into a facial... Bad Move!!!Shar was pretty condescending & didn't particularly provide a relaxing atmosphere. But the worst was my facial was interrupted by the front desk girl. Shar excused herself, came back a few minutes later (very apologetically) telling me all the supplies were in the room we were in. She gathered a few things, continued to apologize & assured me she'd be right back.  Ten mins later, the front desk girl came in to offer me water & apologize for Shar's absence; she also assured me Shar would be back within two minutes. Fifteen minutes after that, with no sign of Shar returning, I gathered my things & left.  I was clear that I would not be paying for a facial that was not complete & the front desk girl was apologetic & polite. She also offered me a free facial the next time I came in. I politely informed her that I would NEVER be coming back. Bottom line... go elsewhere!!!

"I was very curious about eyelash extensions so I purchased a groupon for a ""flirt set"" at The Brow Lady. The shop is small and it looks like they do a range of services like nails and waxing as well. I agree with Shar B. about the front desk staff. I wasn't greeted in a friendly manner upon entering either, just hustled into the back room.First of all, I really wish their website gave some details and information on the do's and dont's of having these lashes if you've never gotten them before. If you live in a humid climate (or plan on traveling to a humid climate), or do anything like swimming or hot yoga, then skip them. Here I was lying on the table telling my eyelash lady that I was about to leave for a trip to southeast Asia (I was hoping to do the eyelashes and forgo packing makeup) and she tells me ""well I'll be surprised if they last a week"". Huh So I said ""what do I do if I go swimming"" and she says ""dry them immediately with a hairdryer"". Of note, there are no electrical outlets in the remote jungle of Laos, and no, I wasn't  planning on bringing a hairdryer. As she was applying I was already feeling cheated in paying for this once I heard they wouldn't last, but then she commented that she finished in record time....30 min. I thought ok, how long does it normally take Their brochure and website says 1 12 hrs. So now, I was feeling cheated again, like I didn't get the full treatment because I came in with a groupon. Well she was right about them falling off. As I sweated my way through yoga and then enjoyed swimming, etc on my trip they became scarce. I eventually had to pull the remaining few off which wasn't fun. They might be worth it for a really important occasion like your wedding or something, but don't plan on them lasting through your honeymoon.

"Let me start off by saying I've been here once before for eyebrows and they didn't turn out so well. I ended up with scabs on both my eyebrows for two weeks (not too pretty). Now let me start my review on my nails... They made it a bit difficult for me to make an appointment, but since I was leaving town they could squeeze me in. I got there, was seated pretty quickly, and then chose my color. I decided to go with gels, I've done them before so I knew the process fairly well. There was absolutely no room in their ""nail salon"" section. I didn't feel as if my girl did my nails well what-so-ever. I feel bad to name her, because in all honestly she was extremely sweet just had no idea how to do proper gels or a standard pedicure. My gels were soft, and had indents in them. Gels are supposed to be hard so that kind of thing doesn't happen. Now my pedicure... It was awful! She didn't know how to do an even coat. I do not understand. I do a much better job. So I called the manager, Nikki I believe was her name. All she did was make excuses for the girl saying oh maybe it was bad lighting or a bad curing machine for the gels. Seriously I would never go back there to see any nail tech. They offered to do my nails again but honestly it was so uncomfortable in there and everyone had to keep moving around each other. Save your money and find an actual nail salon where they have some massage chairs and space!

"At this moment, I am very frustrated with this business. I booked a gel manicure and a pedicure appointment for today at 4:30 PM. When I showed up on time for my appointment, the two girls at the front let me know that they were ""just about to email me"" because they were running behind. I get it. This is the nature Of the service industry. I completely understand if a business gets busy and begins to fall behind. However, I am sure that they realized at some point (at minimum half an hour or so) before my appointment, that they were running behind. To reach out to me at the exact time of my appointment is pretty rude, since by that time, customers (like me) are generally already at the business's location ready for their appointment. I was also frustrated, because the receptionist also said that she was just about to ""email me."" This made no sense to me, as they already had my cell phone number, which is a much more reliable way to contact someone (especially when you're calling them at the exact time of their appointment, when they are usually parking or walking in; not checking email). I was extra disappointed because I was doing my nails for my anniversary and had a hair appointment and spray tan scheduled right after (meaning no flexibility in the schedule). The girls were very sweet and apologetic, but the lack of professionalism around simply picking up the phone and calling me as soon as they realized that they were falling behind is pretty inexcusable.

"Saw this place on Groupon. My call was answered immediately by the receptionist who was friendly and scheduled an appointment for the next morning-a  Saturday.  I had a full set of eyelashes put on by Valencia. They looked very nice-she finished the whole set in about 30 minutes. Previously I've had full sets take 1.5+ hours. Here's the problem: That night my eyes were red and irritated. The next morning (Sunday) I woke up with my eyes very swollen, red and irritated. I called ""The Brow Lady"" and left a message-no response within 2days. On Tuesday, with my eyes still red and swollen, I went there around 1pm-the salon was closed with a sign that said they would be back at 4pm. I called and left another message saying that I'd had a bad reaction to the lashes and needed them removed. No response- to this day-3 weeks later. BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE :(

"Despite all the bad reviews I read, I desperately needed a manicure and decided to come here. Big mistake.The guy that was doing my nails clearly had no idea what he was doing. I had just had a manicure the week before so I really didn't have a lot of cleaning up to do. The guy went cuticle crazy, kept pushing them as hard as he could it seemed. Then he clipped off part of my nail bed that didn't need to be, it absolutely killed and started bleeding profusely. To stop the blood, he put that blue liquid on it and then proceeded to rub as hard as he could with a paper towel, causing the cut to bleed even more. It didn't stop bleeding for the rest of the appointment, causing my manicure to have some blood mixed in with the nail color on the ring finger nail.Then the next day, I was washing dishing and the nail polish came off on 2 of my fingers. I had a gel manicure, it's supposed to last TWO weeks... it didn't even last a DAY!Never again. Do yourself a favor and do not visit this place. Spend your money somewhere that is worth it!

"A NOTE TO THE OWNER:Your employee, the scrawny, balding man, should be fired. He was yelling at me and saying extremely rude things instead of fixing the nails to make the customer happy. I've never been treated this way by any company that I've ever done business with. I urge you to take a few moments to read about what happened from the customer's point of view, as I'm sure that you may hear about it but from a different light that is favorable to the scrawny, balding man.MY REVIEW: They shouldn't even get ONE STAR. The scrawny man with the receding hair that works there is the ultimate cause of this poor review.Sit back and enjoy this story...This was my very first time at this place and I was actually excited because the interior was pretty nice.I went in to touch up my gel polish and get a pedicure. I get French on both, and I've gotten it done enough times to know that the white part should not have BUBBLES or CRATERS in it! So I kindly asked him to fix the white part before we put it under the UV light again. So he did, and we put it under the light, when I took them out...there they were...craters, bubbles, missing white parts, streaks...(how do you post pics on here) I swear it looked like I did it myself. He said it's supposed to look like that.Instead of fixing them, he yelled at me...I mean...he YELLED AT ME worse than my own father ever has. He was so rude, and the things he said to me were jaw dropping! I honestly was in shock and could not believe my ears! Now, I know that people say that there are two sides to every story, but I promise you that I wasn't happy with the white part and asked him to fix it and he flipped out and started taking it off! As a customer...I've never ever been talked to, oh I'm sorry, YELLED AT, like that in my entire life. I told him, ""I've never been treated this way in my life. You're being very rude to a first time customer!"" He said, ""Ive never had a customer tell me how to do my job!""I said, I'm just asking you to fix the white, LOOK can't you see the dots Does this honestly look okay to you"" Then he started to file it all offf.I was like ""what are you doing, just fix the white!"" He said, ""No I'm gonna take it off and you can just leave""I said, ""What No, I came here to get my nails done and I just don't want the french white part to have bubbles or dots on it.""He yelled, ""I've been doing this 20 years, how old are you (I don't know what my age has to do with it, but I suppose he was trying to say that he's been doing this longer than I've been living."" (for the record I'm 28 and not an immature teenager bashing this place) Anyway, so the yelling at me continued and at this point I begin to yell back because I was not going to take the verbal abuse or mistreatment any longer. I've never experienced such an episode.He had the UV thing on my lap, I tried to hand it to him and I said please get this off of me, and he slid his seat away and was telling me to drop it so it can break! Seriously! drop itThen I said, ""I want to talk to the owner of this place. You are so rude and should not be treating customers this way!""He YELLED at the top of his lungs like he wanted to hit me...""NO! YOU ARE NOT GOING TO TALK TO THE OWNER, YOU DEAL WITH ME I'M THE BOSS NOW!!"" I was like WHAT IN THE WORLD IS YOUR PROBLEM I just wanted you to fix the white part of my nails!Then he said, ""pay for the pedicure and get out of here and we will be happy if you never come back!"" (can you believe this guy!)I don't know how this next part even happened (and this literally JUST HAPPENED) but he said he was going to call the cops, I was like good, please do, or better yet, I will. So the cops came. (yes, seriously)I told them and SHOWED them my hands of how poor of a job he did and the way he treated me. The cops obviously can't do anything about this situation so it was dumb even having them come. The guy didn't even have anything to say but, ""She is trying to tell me how to do my job"" It's like whatever happened to trying to get the nails like the customer likes them Especially a new customerAnyway, so I paid them for the pedicure and left with the nails you're about to see...I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE AT ALL. NOT EVEN IF THEY OFFER A FREE MANICURE AND PEDICURE. THEY DO A SLOPPY JOB.THEY ARE PURELY MEAN AND RUDE TO THEIR CUSTOMERS.The guy seriously yelled at me for at least 10 minutes, maybe more. I have never been so disrespected in my life.I was literally crying because of this man! If you were there, your ears would have perked up and you would have been so shocked to hear the things he was saying and THE WAY he was saying them.I don't think I'm even painting the picture of how evil he is as best as I could. I wish I could recall all of the insanely rude things that he lashed out at me with.Oh, and they don't take credit cards by the way...they have a lovely ATM machine for your convenience (please take note of my sarcasm)

"I just found out that the scrawny, balding, little man is the owner!!! Wow! I remember asking him why they didn't take credit cards and he said it was because the owner didn't want to since it costs more. What a coward.I told my friend about my experience and she also had a horrifying experience there with the work they did and their customer service. I hope they go out of business for mistreating customers. How do they still have customersBy the way, when I got home and took a closer look at my pedicure...I realized that it looked like a 5 year old did that colors outside the lines.

"If I could leave 0 stars I would. I went in for a simple polish change and had the worst experience I've ever had at a salon. A kid could have painted my nails better. Such a waste of money. I would never come back to this sad excuse for a nail salon

"I was so hopeful! Especially since it's in the same parking lot as TJMaxx!  I need a salon that I can come to regularly.I came in for a pedicure and once she couldn't talk me into more than the basic one, I got the least amount of attention. Especially when it came to scrubbing my calluses. Since I wasn't buying another $10 worth if callus remover she didn't scrub for more than literally 7 seconds per foot. I was wearing a long skirt that she actually let dangle in the water. Won't be back ;(

"OMG. One of THE WORST nail salons I have EVER been to. First off, I explained to my nail girl (forgot to get her name) twice what I wanted because she did not bring back the correct colors so she clearly did not understand. I got the response ""I know"" in an EXTREMELY rude tone. So I thought maybe she would get the other colors later. Nope. She started to paint all my nails the wrong color, so I stopped her and explained again. She did not apologize or anything. The ENTIRE time she was doing my nails she spoke to her co workers, all of whom were walking around the salon with no shoes on. Unprofessional Secondly, the customer service over all was horrible. No one was friendly AT ALL. Lastly, MY NAILS LOOK HORRIBLE!!! There is nail polish all over my cuticles and sides of nails. The polish is uneven, and the design, even after showing her three times, was STILL DONE WRONG. Not sure how to attach a photo over wise I would. I will never go back here, even with the great coupons I have. If I could give this place zero stars I would.
",0
"Actually doesn't even deserve one star.  The whole time they asked if I wanted this and that extra.  I did give in and got $33 pedicure which includes callus remover.  I got home and my feet look exactly the same.  They also charged $3 for shiny buff which looks like CRAPPPPPPPP.  Oh and at the end my bill being $83 they tell me they need cash or check or I can use their ATM for $1 charge.  After a little while she then decides it is ok to use my card.  I am so disappointed with this place, especially taking my mom here for Mother's Day.  The one lady also had nerve to say that I should pay and I am rich.  WOW!!  Thankfully I am employed and am able to pay but cant imagine if I couldn't.  Anyway,  PLEASE PLEASE don't waste your time nor money here.  They can care less what your nails look like.

"Don't go to this salon.  They not only did a terrible job but they were rude and charged a lot for the service they provided.  The place looked ok when you first walk in but once you sit in the chair you notice their trays are dirty and they don't use clean sterile tools.  The male tech that did my pedicure didn't speak English, didn't clean out the nail bed to prepare it to be painted and painted the nails getting the polish on the skin.  This place was a waste of time and money.  I'm very surprised the health department didn't shut them down yet
",0
"I know better than to not read reviews before I go into a business. However, I came here out of convenience when the normal salon I go to was closed. My pedicure was mediocre at best.  She was not meticulous in getting polish on the entire nail. She also did not clean up the skin where she had gotten polish on it close to the nail. I will definitely not be back. It's a nice facility with clean equipment, but the professionalism is not there for me.

"So sad to say, I have to change my rating from 5 stars to 1.  I had been a faithful customer of Katie's for years, at least 3 or 4!  She told me she wasn't going to be doing nails anymore because she had developed carpal tunnel.  I was heartbroken.  But she told me she was training the others in her shop to be able to do nails like her so I figured I would continue to go there.  Next appt I needed, I called and scheduled and said it doesn't matter with who because Katie isn't doing nails anymore, right  I was then told that Katie is still doing nails but she was full that day.  Very hurtful!  I always tipped her VERY well and was always willing to work with her schedule.  But needless to say, I don't go there anymore, haven't been there since I ended up cancelling that appt and going elsewhere.

"I am a longtime customer of this spa, but after it turned over to new management, I have to say I will never be back.  I got a gel mani that lasted LESS THAN 2 weeks.

"HOLY SH*T!! I have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life!! I've been here quite a few times but today's visit has convinced me never to come back. Okay so I walk in , there are about 5 women getting pedicures and NONE getting manicures. Of course, I want a full set. The employees were kind of slow on getting me a nail tech...and oh my gosh, I have the worst luck because my nail tech was a horror. So let me explain....Okay, so first impression when he sits down in front of me: This guy looks like he has the flu. He was sweating and his eyes were drooping and he looked like he was about to vomit every other second. BUT if he wasn't sick, I have NO IDEA what the hell he was doing in the back of the shop. As he applied the acrylics on my nails, he was shaking frantically and kept violently tapping my fingers everytime I moved them. I kept patient and calm until his palm started sweating. I wasn't okay with his body fluids all up in my fingernails so I asked ""Are you okay"" And he didn't respond. Awkward....so after a while, he asked me where I lived and I said ""Scottsdale"" and he says ""I thought you would have said south Phoenix, like with the crips and bloods"", then chuckled. LISTEN, I am not one to start confrontation by any means so I forced myself to stay calm until he was finished my nails. I paid him the $35 and left. He looked rather angry that I did not leave him a tip.I do not recommend this nail salon. I am very disappointed in the way the staff has treated me today and I think that I will travel to Tempe to have a decent nail experience.

"I have gone to this club in the past and have enjoyed the experience.   I recently decided to revisit this club and had a bad experience .  I saw a dancer that caught my eye. I offered her a drink and a dance. After her canoodling me  I gave in and said i'll take  one ( 30 dollar)  dance.After some pleasant conversation over the drink( I treated her to),  the dance began .  After four minutes the song was over and I reached in my pocket to give her the 30 + 5 dollars for a tip, when she explained I actually owed her 60 dollars  because it was 2 songs.  By my count it was one dance. Apparently she decided to count the 5 minutes of  time we spent talking over the drinks i bought her as part of the dance as well.   I thought she was kidding and gave her the $ 35. This  beautiful little angel suddenly became a crazy little devil. She called her manager and made me out to be some kind of lunatic lowlife cheapskate.   I politely explained the situation to the  manager but he insisted i pay up which i promptly did .  After wards i made a quick exit.   There was no mistaken that I was being blatantly scammed here.  I was in the club for less then 10 minutes and hadn't even finished my first beer, and was not drunk in the least.   Unless you don't mind being scammed by a dancer, and paying 60 dollars for a 4 minute dance I would  steer clear from this establishment .  A night I was hoping to relax over a beer and a beautiful dancer cost me 80 dollars for less then 10 minutes of harassment and aggravation.  It appears to be a pretty good club and i couldn't say if they regularly scam the patrons,  but  they sure as hell scammed me.  On principle I'll avoid this place  and I'll tell my friends to go elsewhere as well. The are  a ton of clubs in the area with gorgeous girls  that even have signs on the table that you will never pay for a dancer's time or for  her simply talking to you.You've  been warned .Jay

"This place is a craphole. My friends and I have gone for a 2 AM breakfast a couple of times (I know that seems weird but it's cheaper than eating at the diner that caters the breakfast!) and the people working there are absolute dicks. The girl at the front door acts like she's the hottest thing since sliced bread. The girls that walk around are bit*hes unless you're throwing wads of money out. I jokingly told one of the girls that my friend wanted a lap dance and within 5 minutes he came back really mad. He said she danced and he handed her $30 and she said ""NO! It's $60!""  That's crazy considering the girls don't even look very good! Maybe I'm biased because I'm not a strip club kind of guy but this place is a bad way to end a good night

"Picture it, if you will.  Little old me, drinking at the Bikini Lounge from 2 in the afternoon until midnight with 3 friends.  Drinking, drinking, drinking.  So after 10+ hours of living solely off of beer, there can surely be no better idea than going to a strip club.  RightSo we pack up and head on over.  A high cover (sorry, for the life of me I don't remember how much) and a 2 drink minimum (which I do realize is standard) later, we're immersed in black light.  As my eyes adjust, I start to see that this is really not the crowd I expected to see in a strip club.  There is ZERO energy.  No talking.  No laughing.  Nothing but rows of guys sitting and looking blankly at the dancers.We found some empty chairs in the back, and settled in there, and I was able to turn my attention to the girls.  Ok, look:  I know they can't all be Elizabeth Berkley (may the Lord keep her feisty Nomi Malone safe and warm forever).  But I didn't expect this apathy.  Bored looking women taking their short turns on the small round main stage, and more bored looking women walking around offering lapdances in vain.  The thing about stripping is this:  I thought the point was that you could make a lot of money.  But we were there at midnight on a Saturday night, and these girls were getting NOTHING.  In the hour we were there, I saw ONE man put money in a girl's pants on stage... and I watched, and it was a one dollar bill.  Seriously.I sat there with my 3 friends (2 men, one other woman), all of us in a row, all of us suddenly sober, staring with our eyes and mouths wide open.  I could feel my male friends' good mood deflate (ha!  don't be dirty), as my girl friend and I felt like gender traitors just by being there.I thought these kind of places were supposed to be rowdy and fun.  Was I expecting too much  It was the most depressing experience.   I sort of feel bad even writing this, because nobody involved with that joint can be happy, I'm sure.  But I figured I owe it to all you Yelp gentleman (and the ladies, too...who am I to presume) to steer you away from this one.

"I think Max, Eric & Jason summed this place up pretty well. I dont think I'd ever get a dance here. It was Friday about 10pm-ish we were there about an hour I did not see one attractive girl come out. In fact this was the worst line up I have ever seen...EVAR!! I wont nit pick about the girls I saw but I will not be returning either. Ladies if your feeling down about a little weight gain go here.....hell who am I kidding even i it's a lot of weight gain, do your self esteem a favor and start your night here!!

"This is THE WORST strip club I have ever been to. I have been to a lot of seedy clubs as well. I've been to clubs where every chick is coked out of her mind to the point where she can't even dance, clubs where chicks are dancing around while the other strippers are watching their babies, even places where girls say they have been raped by club owners. Nothing, and I mean NOTHING is as bad as this club. The New York City bouncer out front was a nice guy, and thats where it stopped. The girls here are downright disgusting. These girls don't even look good enough to work the counter at MVD. The place is also crawling with undesirables at all times of the day and night. Their drinks are about $7 for a captain and coke, there were no girls dancing when we were there, the three girls who were working were basically asking if we wanted dances and when I said no, then rolled their eyes and walked away. Well, maybe these girls could dance on stage and THEN ask for a private dance... I want to see what you're made of first.The dress code out front, the disgusting women, the attitude from bartenders, and the overall grossness of this place earn it a one star. It would be negative one if it were an option. Hi LIter, Bombshells, and even Cheetah's are a ton better than this place. They are cheaper, have better talent, and are very friendly places. Even the overpriced Bourbon Street would be a better bet than this.

"On name alone we HAD to check this place out, just for kicks.Ouch!Bandaids indeed; this place hurts and not in a good way. And you might want to spritz that with some iodine for good measure.I've got no qualms with talent, don't get me wrong; the female form is a beautiful thing to behold in all of its varied curve-tastic shape and form. A woman is a woman is a beautiful woman, and I'm a sucker. By default, naked womanhood warrants an automatic 3-star baseline from me, but the slummy and desperate atmosphere in this dive is a soulsuck for all that dare enter.The squat brick building sits all by its lonesome under a tacky illuminated ""Bandaids Show Lounge"" sign, the surrounding parking lot emanating with ""damn, I'mma get mugged out here"" uncertainty and darkness.Once inside (yes, you go in through a sketchy looking front door that looks as welcoming as the sketchy looking service door), you're met by security and carded; the girls headed for the bar while another friend and myself were subjected to a [sub-standard*] pat down - *sub-standard: the folding knife clipped and visible in my front pocket (CA law) went unnoticed.  A printed ""no sideways caps, no baggysaggy jeans, no long tees"" dress code posted by the door should have been a red flag. Classy!After getting a few beers from the pretty bartender (she was actually really, really good-looking - hottest girl on staff, setting false precedent for what the stage talent would look like), we made our way past shady regulars at the bar with their necks crook'd to the lounge, finding a couple of tables near, but not next to, the center stage.Most of us sat talking and laughing with each other, occasionally glancing at the stage just to see what's up and watching the depraved humanity of the other patrons in the place, mostly empty on a Friday night...... the out-of-towner business man in the dark corner, getting dances from any girl that would come his way.... the mouth-breather waiting with stalker-ish anticipation for a dance with one of the, er, more amply-bossomed strippers.... the table of youngins, dressed exactly how the posted dress code prohibited.Girl after girl (a couple of ""a'ight"" girls, most ""everyday"" girls, and at least one ""is that a girl"" girls) came to the stage, gyrated to cliche strip club music - some exhibiting-gymnast calibre pole skills and limberness - then cruised the showroom floor, peddling their wares with a repeated-to-monotone-perfection ""...would you like a dance  ...would you like a dance"" propositioning. Sales Basics 101: Always Be Closing, rightNone of us partook in the festivities, but two friends in an adjoining party did.  One, quite simply because he was bored and someone paid for it.  The other, a recent migrant from war-torn and fundamentalist Afghanistan, got one of the [few] Barbie-esque dancers who would keep him entranced and occupied for 4-5 songs... and about $100.After a quick 30 minutes, we'd thought we'd seen the whole rotation of ""meh"" talent and skeevy behavior.  And that's when we saw it......the epitome of tacky divey strip club attire......the summation of the Bandaids experience......that's when we saw it... ...The HOOD-KINI*!It was time to leave... quickly.

"1990's this place was the best club around.  Now it's the worst. I mean sure there are a few boobies to look at but that's about it.  The girls don't talk to anyone and ask if you want a table dance.  I checked around the room a few times and other than the three dancers on the three stages THERE WERE NO OTHER GIRLS TO BE SEEN IN THE PLACE, (well other than the ones in our party, but they weren't dancing).We tried asking the servers to bring us some dancers, and nothing.  We tried to make it rain money on the dancers and told them to come back and nothing!  This was a ""busy"" Saturday night so you would think the dancers would on their A game, but nothing. If I'm gonna go to a titty bar I at least want that stripper perfume sent on me next time!  I going to check out Band-Aids next time

"I didn't spend quite enough time in here to give this a totally legit review, but when me and my friend walked in, it was darker than most clubs inside, the place was very small and very packed with creepers, and the girls didn't take their tops off. They just wore what looked like bikinis. I just think if you go to a strip club, they should show you their boobs. Maybe they do and we just didn't stay long enough to see it, but until I see different this place gets a 1.

"As a veteran of the strip club scene and former dancer at Heartbreakers, now Bombshells, I'm sending out a big ""Shame on you!"" to the management at Bombshells! We rented a party bus for my best friends bachelor party and were told Bombshells was one of the clubs on the V.I.P. list. I called the club to alert of our arrival time to make sure we could get in. The person I spoke to was quite rude over the phone, but said they make decisions regarding admittance on a case by case basis. I told him we were a large group, would buy drinks, and as a former dancer, all my friends are schooled to pay the dancers well! When we got there, we were met at the door and told we would have to pay full cover and that they wouldn't do anything special for our bachelor. Lucky for us, our driver got a tip to go the the Hi-Liter, which turned out the be the best ever!! So, again, shame on you Bombshells! And to the girls who missed out on lots of money that night... go work at a real club! Peace

"I went to a strip club in Mexico once and had a memorable experience. One that I've tried to replicate for many years after.The stripper, who was very cute and also very proud of her lactating skills, would for all of a buck hastily whip out one of her tits on demand, squeeze it, and shoot a stream of milk at you. She reminded me of drunk me, peeing in a parking lot someplace...waving my stream around until I've spelled out my name.  People...now that's entertainment!As compared with the Candy Store, where some dumb-as-a-bag-of-hammers stripper who's all too willing to spend a few thousand bucks on breast implants while badly in need of dental implants, snubs you because the black-light illumination is prominently displaying  the pee stain on your cargo shorts. The Candy Store.Nice boobs.Bad grilles.And girls with no fundamental lactating  squirting abilities, which they should possess since most are single moms. A disappointment on every level.

"Visited this club while on a trip to AZ for a Niners game; from LA. Not a very diverse or diversity friendly club my boyfriend and I and another couple (who all happen to be African American) we followed around by the security and the $100 bill we paid for drinks and tips with was passed around several times to validate it's validity. A few dancers did an excellent job with pole dancing and tricks but the music wasn't really good (not that we needed to hear rap or hip hop) mostly old rock music and no name house music.

I usually don't write a bad review, and if there is something wrong I prefer to tell it to the owner, but this place was so bad that I feel like whoever is in charge of this place is just disrespectful.It was a saturday night we got there at 11:00 pm there were maybe 15 people in the club,which looked weird to me because the club is very impressive. It took more than 30 min for the waiters to come to our table, no girls came to out table for the whole time that we've been there, beside to the fact that there were no more than 5 dancers.We left after about 45 min that club without even finish our drinks, and went to another club.

It was very busy, we had to wait a little for seats. After we got settled, we enjoyed the girls on stage for a while, but we were there for almost two hours and not one girl approached us for a dance! We finally got the attention of one who took us to the booths in the back. $40 for a ""couples"" dance. one song, and I got pretty much completely left out of it (so much for couples part) She didn't even try very hard either.We immediately left and went to Sapphire and had the time of our lives.

"This is an overdue review for one of the worst experiences ever in Vegas!So a pack of us are in Sin City for ""Frozen Fury"" to watch the Kings play Colorado.  Emotions were riding high since the Kings won and was going to be my buddy's first time at a Strip Club!We stroll in grab seats and enjoy the festivities.  Hot chicks everywhere so I slowly drift off into Candyland...ahhhhhh.  Little did I know that the wolves were slowly working on one young pup.  A dancer came over and whispered into the ""Pup"" ears and off he went to the VIP room.3-6-8 Songs later...I ask...""Where's Puperoni"".  Of course, the others in the pack ignored me.   Songs continue....chi chis are bouncing....."" Hey C...where is your boy"".  C gets up and heads to the VIP room.  Bouncer stops him from entering and tells him he cant go in.  By then, our group heads to see what's up.At some point, the Dancer was able to get the ""Pup's"" credit card and racked up a bill for $990 and took him for $170 in cash.  WTF!  Okay, now maybe it was at least 10 songs with full nudity, but how do rack up $1000 for lap dances  BullSh*t!My buddy's pup signed the credit card receipt so there was nothing to contest except that our young apprentice got taken.  Little ""Sparky"" has a crappy job making $9 an hour, so this $1000+ lesson should be around for quite a while.  I had a great time, venue was cool but do the ""Little Darlings"" at Little Darlings have to feed on the young.  I was also taught that ""you get more bees with honey"".  I guess not.  Not sure if I would ever go back.  If you provide a wild and exciting time, the boys will come, however, this was all shady.  Definitely rubbed me the wrong way.  You only get one star cause I can't give you less...but then again you already took what you could.Advice, watch your young or leave the pups at home.  There are tons of other places to go in Vegas.  Next time, I will recommend to stay in CA and call up the girls from Ashley Entertainment.

"After finding out that most strip clubs in Vegas were 21+ (Yes, in Cali almost all strip clubs are 18+ due to alcohol laws) my gf and I had no choice but to come to this lovely hole in the wall. 30 dollars cover charge, not bad for Vegas you know So I keep an open mind and take a step in..  The real problem for me was that  there wasn't really any ""stripping"" per say. The strippers would come out in their bathing suits.. then go to the back, take it off then come out completely naked. WTF Isn't stripping supposed to be sexy Stripping done right is an art, but all these girls would do was come out naked and do the SAME moves. They would shake their asses around repeatedly and of course all the horn dogs would drool and think its the best thing on earth. Yawn.There were also questionable role playing and dancing.There was an act of grim reaper.. Yes she came out in a grim reaper outfit (with the blade and all) I was confused and started laughing. There's nothing sexy about a grim reaper... Why not have a dominatrix or something that's more appealing There was also a strange part where they layed a blanket out and poured candle wax on their bodies.. Kinky Nope.... for some reason it was just gross. They were so unattractive, physically and personality wise. There were also 3 strippers that made a huge fuss on stage. They were wildly waving their arms around at each other because nobody tipped them while they were on their poles. They were all mad and they even went up to a guy and started yelling when he gave them two dollars. Then she proceeded to flip him off. Errr... people pay you to STRIP not to be a bitch. If you would just do your job and do it WELL, people would freaking tip you. Period. Overall, the girls were all around 6's. They were out of shape (stretch marks, pooches and tatts everywhere), unenthusiastic and looked miserable! I swear, some of them looked like they would rather go to jury duty then to be dancing at that club.. I don't know where this establishment got these ""dancers"" but for Vegas I was thoroughly disappointed. When I come back again in a few weeks (when I turn 21) hopefully I'll visit a real Vegas strip club such as Spearmint Rhino or Treasures.Save your money for quality guys!

"We went for a bachelor party for a friend. Extremely sketchy but it was super cheap.  Some of the dancers threatened to throw us out because my friend didn't give them $40 for a dance, when we saw him hand them two $20s.  Also, when we were just sitting and smoking hookah and having a good time, girls would come over and get angry at us for not getting a dance. It was awkward and sketchy and ridiculous.  Never again.

"On my drunken conquest to visit my very first all nude strip club, our cab driver suggested this place. We pulled into the parking lot, saddled up with our driver, and at 5:45am, we were told the place was closing at 6am and that they were not allowing any more clients for the evening. BOO!

"I will never go to this place again, and I recommend the many otherclubs for anyone looking for a good time while in Vegas. I was charged double the posted rate for a dance by a dancer namedCya. When I brought the overcharging to a managers attention,instead of refunding my money they gave me entry passes to the club.  Ihope Cya gets fired for being fraudulent and lying to management about what shecharges customers.  Dances are $20 per song, I was charged $40 per song for topless only.Again, I will not be returning to this club as longas Cya is employed there and I suggest everyone do the same.  Saveyour money and go to a better club.

"Took my just turned 18 year old cousin to here while we were in town. We did this package that included VIP seating, unlimited hookah, a picture for the celebrant and admission for 10 people for $250.I had already spoken with someone over the phone and they said it would be ok for us to get the package. And when we got there, they acted like ""what package!"" We ended up talking to the manager and when we showed the money, they remembered that they did have this package. We walked thru the metal detectors and were seated on three couches up front near the stage. It was almost 1am and there were a handful of people. I guess it was couples night and there were a handful of couples tryna get they're ""freak on"" I guess. When they came to ask what flavor hookah we wanted, they said they only had two flavors left. So we got those two flavors, mint & fruit punch. And when picture time came, the stupid waitress didn't even know how to work the camera. And all they did was print the picture and  tape it to a card.So to the good part! There was NO good part. Little Darlings is FULLY NUDE, but the bodies are bangin'. Small boobies, some cute girls and the dancers ARE LAZY AS F%K!! Only a couple got on the pole to do some tricks. Most of them were just walking around stage and rolling around on the floor. It didn't take them long to take their strings of clothes off. I thought dancing was supposed to be an ""art form"", but I guess do what you gotta do for those dollar$.Unless, we came on a bad night or the wrong time, I would NEVER come back here again. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone either.

"This is embarrassing to write about but it's that important for everyone to know this place is a huge scam!  First you have to pay $33 cover for out of towners which is expensive since other clubs have free admission and a limo ride. Not to be mean but the girls are not as hot as other places, which my group immediately noticed. Also I WANT TO WARN EVERYONE that 2 of my friends got hustled here so be very wary of anything extra they offer.  If you come, avoid anything extra but the smart thing is DONT COME HERE

"I really like this place.  The Children shows are awesome so when I heard of the adult shows I thought it would be brilliant.  I WAS WRONG...I had actually spoken to the staff prior to attending the show, they told me something along the lines of it was for adults, not for the easily offended, but nothing xxx.  I was miss informed... I'm not easily offended.  I am also a fan of stand up comedy.I am not sure where to start.  I guess they feel that since its for adults they should say s**t every other word.  The first half had sketches that were decent at best, some entertaining.  I laughed once or twice.  Some of the puppeteers were really good at animating their puppets.  All and all 1st half was eh 2-3 out of 5.Well then there was intermission and the second half began.   Oh boy where to begin where to begin.  It was so slow and boring.... The Tucson Puppet Works should really look into another hobby.  The puppets were poorly made.  It was just bad.  I think I heard maybe one or two people laugh during the entire thing.  For about 4 minutes it was just puppets having sex.  It was boring.  Team America Puppets having sex funny, this, well this was crap.  I kept hoping it wold be over and the new sketch would start.  It kept going and going... I finally stole a program from the person sitting next to us.  When I saw that the Tucson Puppet Works had the entire second half of the show, we stood up and walked out.  Children Shows Awesome! Adult Slams... I guess the best way to describe it would be Painful. Extremely PAINFUL!

"Ugh...where to begin...this was such a waste of time. My friends and I attended a Friday night adult puppet show, just curious to see what it would be like. I am glad it was only $8. I felt like apologizing to everyone afterward  because the entire show was so disappointing.The jokes were not witty, the skits were disorganized and one of them just sad, no one laughed the entire time. For example, one of the skits was about a gay pirate. What is funny about this How is this an adult theme Just because he is gay it is an adult theme Another skit involved a jilted Cinderella-type character who was angry that her Prince Charming left her for a man. Again, it's adult-themed because he's gay Ok... just not funny. Another low-point in the show was the improv skit, where they asked the audience for a topic and just went with it. The only word I can think of to express what happened is ""cringe-worthy."" So, what did I expect from an adult puppet show Well, FUNNY jokes that I have not heard before, and weren't funny just because they're gross. I expected intelligent humor, maybe innuendo and some wit. I don't mind cursing or sexual humor at all, just wanted it to not be so...lame.

"For the adult puppet slam:We were excited to go.....and we wanted this to be a riotous and fun night.....but.....Just. Not. Good. Seriously bush league, a hodge-podge of barely talented people claiming artistry or humor. Only mildly entertaining for a few (very) brief moments.  That was pretty much the consensus amongst the four of us.

"I am extremely disappointed.  I planned my whole Sunday around this area, since we wanted to see the puppet show.  The twins were talking about it all morning long.  We went to lunch, and then the twins said "" puppet"", it was still a little early so we stopped by to get to sweets to take home.  We got there at 1:15p.m.  They told us to be there by 1:30 since then is when they open the doors and it is first come first serve.  There were two families before us.  The place seemed a little cleaner than last time we were there.  We got in and sat in the carpet (which is the closest for the kids).  The seats are now a little farther away, so I had to sit also on the floor to the side by my twins.  I don't like to leave them unsupervised yet (yes, I am a little bit of a helicopter, they are 4 after all).  The show was supposed to start at 2:00p.m.  The cute little brothers in front of us were asking us the time every five minutes.  When it was 2 they got all excited, but nothing.  10 minutes went by and nothing.  20, nothing, I had to whip out my iPhone and give it to my little girl to have her watch some netflix to keep her calm, my hubby did the same with our little boy, for a while we had a crowd surrounding our kids around the phones.  Finally at 2:30, after sitting in the hard floor for an hour they tell us they are going to start, so they begin with their schtick and ""rules"", this started to go on and on, it seems like they are frustrated comedians trying their material on this audience.  After 15 minutes I had to leave, because my kids could not take it any more.  I cannot blame them.  They were very good for one hour and 15 minutes of doing nothing but sitting on a hard floor.  I am glad it was a Groupon and not full price, I didn't even ask for a refund, because I am never, ever, ever coming back.

"The staff is extremely Rude. The blonde older lady was Nasty to us and our kids.  We finally had to snap back when she was mean to our kids. We drove 2 hrs with our family it cost us over $50.00 to get in. Caught the last show, it wasn't a puppet show. Just old props and singing. My kids were disappointed. They are under 5 and also expected a puppet show. I will Never recommend this place. Is this what Pheonix has to offer Horrible money grabbers!! don't talk to ppls kids diguisting ""Ever"" lady. Or the Parents.  Save your money ppl and catch a movie.

"My family of 4 (3 and 5 yr old) wanted to love this place, but it was a waste of money!!!  We want our $60 back!! First of all, they claim to have the largest conservatory in America.  Yes, by blueprint this may be true, but when you walk in it does not look like a rainforest in anyway and you only see one or two types of butterflies.  Please make way to Houston's butterfly conservatory (Texas).  That is a real rainforest carrying all kinda of butterflies from around the world.  Also, there was no information to be found on walls about anything you saw.  They give these cards to the children to ask a volunteer for a ""fun fact"" and we only passed 2 volunteers! There was no one available to tell you what you were looking at.  No signage of explanations of any sort.  How is this educational Please please do not waste your money.  You are better off watching YouTube videos or going to the library for information. Also, they had ants and bees.  Same thing no descriptions.  We walk into this tiny aquarium with maybe 3 fish tanks with 2 fish in them.  We saw one lady who asked if we were going to do some petting.. Um ok and proceeds to give us hand sanitizer. First of all what are we petting We put our hands in the water to pet what looks like a stingray No signage!!! No one is there to tell us anything!!! So disappointing.. Again, why is this educational The fish in the tank has a white piece of paper on the wall that looked like they had just printed it earlier that morning with the name of the fish.  That's it!! No other information about where the fish is from.. Nothing.  My husband made a comment.. Hey we eat that fish.  You can get that at the Asian market. Lol oh and when we waited to see the movie, a man came in and had to read off a piece of paper his welcome message which had nothing to do with the movie.  just about where the exits were.  Lol nothing to see here.  The only cool thing my kids got was a butterfly and caterpillar balloon that was not made by them (Willie's creations) because it was the grand opening weekend.  Also, the 3d flight of the butterflies movie was great for the kids, but not worth $60. I don't think so.  Save your money and go to desert botanical.  At least there are people who can give you information. Oh and need to add... It took us 35 min (not including movie) to see everything.  We had planned for this to be at least a 2 hr adventure for the price we were paying!!

"Worst experience ever! It's super expensive and the staff is NOT friendly!! $60 for 1 adult and 2 children's for 30 min and that's include 10 min for a movie!! Again worst experience ever!!! So disappointed ! I don't recommend it whatsoever !!!

"I went on September 1st and I have to say I was miserable.  It was over 65.00 for two adults and a 5yr and 8yr old.  We waited in a long line front from the begining and then went to see a movie.  The movie was good and we did like that but everything else was poor.  This place is beautiful on the outside but a poor set up on the inside.  Hot and humid and the butterfly exhibit though beautiful had dead ends in each section, It would of been more functional to keep it going with the walk way so it was not so congested. Also the ant exhibit was horrible and the fish tanks were really no big deal.  We live in Arizona so we know what scorpions are.  Just think the fee to get in was way to much for what you were given.  The cafeteria cost 13.00 for two bags of candy and two juice boxes and then you leave thru the gift store which every kid was complaining as they wanted a toy or somthing.  Clever on the store part but not fair to the parents.  We bought a plastic butterfly ring and with tax as 4.91 for a 10 cent ring. I will never go back and I bet this will be closed down before to long.   Sorry but have to be honest.

"Do not go with young kids!  Expensive, bad food, small rooms, poor customer service and not stroller friendly.  They make you sit thru a 15 minute movie which was miserable with my little ones.  The food was terrible and overpriced.  People were literally returning rotten fruit in front of me and the cashier would l t take anything off the shelves.  The staff were rude - we got yelled at in the atrium because my toddler had a butterfly land on her and she went nuts I'm talking screaming ballistic.  We could t find a staff to help us so we took the butterfly off of her to get her to stop yelling and immediately a staff appears out of nowhere and is yelling at us for touching it.  I was not impressed with the customer service and was told we couldn't skip the movie even with 3 toddlers who just would not sit still and bothered the people around us.

"Caution consumers! Specifically this poor review belongs to the Mirror Maze part of Butterfly Wonderland. As annual members of Butterfly Wonderland they sent both me and my girlfriend an email that says this...""As a member of Butterfly Wonderland we are extending a sneak peak at the newest must see in Scottsdale. Just print out this email and you will RECEIVE ONE COMPLIMENTARY WALK-THROUGH PASS.""  Seems simple enough but it was at best a bait and switch and more accurately an outright lie.  Adding to the nastiness was a  discourteous staff that found pleasure in being very abrupt about telling us the offer was a mistake which they had no intention of honoring and was good only for a quick single walk through of only their laser area of the venue.  We had two choices.  Pay $9.95 plus tax  per person for each of us and our two children (6 and 4 years old) or we were free to leave. I paid the $43 bucks and we walked through the mirror maze. This Mirror Maze part is not worth the extra fee! My advice is to wait for the carnival to come to town.  The Mirror Maze you'll find in a carnival funhouse will be more entertaining and the carnie staff likely more courteous.

"Dang I wish I knew this was on Yelp. I would save the time and money.I am a hardcore JFK fan. my license plate is JFK! and boy was I disappointed.Everything is a replica, items are scattered in a huge meeting event room, it looks so amateurish I felt like it was disrespectful to the 35th president. Even if it was free admission I'd still be disappointed and upset. I could have done a better job doing it in my living room. Shame on you Tropicana!

"AHHH I checked yelp for this immediately after walking in. Biggest joke by far. I wanted to take pictures to show how absurd the display and over all appearance of this place was, but didn't want to spend any extra time in there, trying to get a refund. It was sparse, everything was a duplicated version, apparently chairs from other presidents and other First Ladies dresses were in there. Nothing what I thought it would be. I would give a higher review for the supervisor that refunded me the 3 tickets I bought for locals, totaling $71. I would have been disappointed even if it was free. Oh well.

"Terrible.$25 a person (plus a $4) fee on top of each ticket. When we got to the ticket ""booth,"" (it was actually a dining table with a table cloth draped over it), the ticket machine wouldn't work. Two people were ahead of us and we still were waiting 20 minutes to buy tickets. Finally (a plus here) a nice couple gave us their extra tickets for free: Thank-you (and boy am I glad I didn't have to pay).Other than the cars, and about 5 wee things, nothing is either real or even related to JFK. It was set up like a primary school science project in a giant, vacant room. The posters with ""facts"" were full of misspellings and even had some questionable accuracy.I spent time in there hoping that I'd stumble upon some gem, but alas it was awful.The icing on the cake was when I fellow decided to cross the rope line to sit at one of JFK cars. HE SHOULD NOT HAVE DONE THIS, AND I DO NOT  CONDONE IT. HOWEVER, the man working at the ""gift area,"" who I assume is also the curator and security guard Began yelling an screaming at this person. He then continued on to call the man ""stupid"" and uttered swear words to himself. Then he did nothing. He allowed this ""offender"" to continue on looking unsupervised. Then I witnessed him talking to another female that appeared to be working the exhibit as well. He spoke loudly using the F-word so that everybody at the exhibit could hear. Finally he expressed that he was less concerned about the car and more about getting the picture back from the ""offender."" What the HellI left shortly after that. I feel like the Tropicana did not do their research on this particular exhibit. I feel that the whole thing was purely for profit and that no legitimate interest or research on JFK was presented.VERY DISSAPOINTED. Glad I didn't pay. To the couple that handed us the free tickets Thank-you in more ways than one!

"My heart is broken.  The Derby machine has been removed for repairs.  They didn't say when it would be back and I have a hunch it is gone for good. The last vestige of the Las Vegas that I love is gone... :'(  Bobby D was right at the end of Casino.. ""Corporations ruined it...  the good ' ol days...  today it's all gone.""  The slot person said it was removed for repairs but I know it was moved because of dollars per square foot or the percentage of the take or the profits per hour or whatever these people use to gouge every last penny of profits.  I am sure they are bringing in a digital version instead.The last known to me derby machine has been sent to storage.  This is not about the removal of a game, this is about the end of an era.  Las Vegas has officially jumped the shark.  The last icon of the real Las Vegas is gone.(as of 12-16-2012)in the event they bring this back, please post.

"Aerogelic Ballooning didn't cancel our reservation for our ride until 16 hour prior.  We had no opportunity to rebook this event in a timely manner.  I had purchased this as a gift for my parents who flew into town specifically for this event.  They stated we can upgrade to a private flight for only $699!  Not accomodating at all with the situation and they SHOULD have canceled in a resonable manner as noted on their policy.  Policy is for US to cancel 72 hours in advance or they will charge us a fee.

"I know it's a long review, but I think you'll enjoy it:This was a couple years ago, but the issues aren't anything that would have changed so I decided to write a review anyway so other people might know what they're getting into.Bf at the time bought the ride for my bday. He paid full price & thought it was a private ride for 2. We ended up in a tiny balloon basket with a pilot & 2 young Asian girls. Lucky for him, he loved Asian girls...a LOT. I am not Asian. You can understand why this was an issue for me. I did not enjoy my bf smashing against 2 hot young Asian chicks in a basket for my birthday. Not the company's fault, but would be nice if they had informed him that there would be other people on our romantic champagne ride. He kept apologizing to me for this but it didn't help.To make it worse, the girls kept complaining about having gotten up early & talking about how they only went on the ride bc their dad paid 12 price for the ride via Groupon. Nothing like knowing my bf spend the equivalent of more than half his menial paycheck on a gift when the other people paid half price. Again, I know it's not the company's fault that some people don't look at Groupon, but it was just another negative on our trip.The pilot was...ok. Ex bf mentioned that I fly airplanes and from that point on the balloon pilot was very condescending toward me.Aside from the questionable company, the ride was strange as well. There is no real launch site. We got up at like 3:30 or 4 a.m. on my bday, drove to a location where we met the crew, then rode around in a van while they tried to figure out where we would launch. I don't know anything about hot air balloons, but driving around for a couple hours was pretty annoying. Guess it's how hot air ballooning goes So...expect that.Guess what you do after you wake up early and drive around with the crew and the hot Asian girls for a long time You put together their hot air balloon! That's right...it's a very Tom Sawyer kind of trick where they're like ""Hey, you're going to ACTUALLY help us built the balloon you're gonna fly in! It's so fun!"" Uhhh...It's not fun. It's work. And the little Asian girls were Scottsdale snobs and refused to help so...for my bday, I got to assemble a hot air balloon at the crack of dawn while one Asian girl stood and watched rolling her eyes and complaining and the other slept in the van bc these 18 year old girls partied too hard the night before. Ugh...The flight itself was fine. Uncomfortable for me bc of the weird situation being squished into a tiny basket with my boyfriend's Asian fantasy girls.I have never been in a hot air balloon before or after this, but the ""landing"" was pretty much a crash. We hit tree tops on the way down. We were told to brace for impact, and the touchdown was very violent. Dust and rocks flying everywhere while the ground crew tried to catch the ropes and help us to stop without tipping over.The ""champagne breakfast"" was the crew throwing out a basket of packaged muffins on a tailgate...think Otis Spunkmeyer style and some Sunny Delight with the option of champagne to mix with the Sunny D. Well...for the two of us who were over 21. Fantasy Asian chicks were like 18 so no ghetto Sunny D mimosas for them. They got in the van and slept while the crew packed up the balloon.So...it wasn't what he thought, wasn't what I thought, and we paid double the price of the other customers. It kinda sucked. Except for the Asian girls...their daddy bought them the ride and they got to sleep a lot and get checked out by my bf the whole time, so I guess it was ok for them. Hopefully they'll write a nicer review.

"I agree with Jason B, the service here SUCKS!!  You have to flag down the wait staff and tell them what you need, they are NOT helpful.  The food was good, when I got it.  I came here with a group of 14.  Most of our party already had dessert, while I still even hadn't gotten my salad.  I was the last one sitting at the table when everyone got up, still eating my food.  This was not a pleasant experience.  The waiter was EXTREMELY forgetful and had to be told several times that I didn't have my food.  I feel that my meal should have been comped, because the way things were handled, I AM NEVER GOING BACK!!

"Stopped in here for a late lunch as I saw this place had high recommendations.  It took some time to get waited on.  There was only 2 tables with people eating and another group of several persons were leaving.  The staff were inconsiderate and just kept standing and talking and taking photos with these people who were on their way out.  I wanted something that was not hot and spicy so I ordered the chicken sandwich.  Waitress asked me if I wanted mushrooms and cheese on it so I asked if the mushrooms were fresh.,  She said they were so I told her to put them on.  One bite into the sandwich and I knew they were not fresh mushrooms bur canned. I sat there for some time waiting for someone to ask me how everything was but nobody ever checked back with me.  I got up and left.  As I was leaving I mentioned to the gal at the counter how disappointed I was and she acted like she didn't hear me and asked me if I was walking out without paying.  I told her I was not going to pay for something I could not eat and should have been told that the mushrooms were canned and not freshVery disappointing food and waste of my time.The area this place is located in is not a very good area and I would advise people to not go after dark.

"If I could give this place no stars, I would. The staff was absolutely the rudest set of people imaginable.  The server, who had the sloppiness of a self dressed 3 year old there who claims to be new and doesn't know the menu, also claims to be the manager. Go figure. We sat down at 715 and walked out by 9, that's how long it took for our meal. I ordered 5 pieces of byrek and the waitress brought it up on herself to only bring out 3 because she said it was too much food for the amount of people I had.......ummmmm okay. So I said that I still wanted the original order of my 5 total and then she said they didn't have any more. So basically lied to my face about it. Amongst the other issues that happened that evening, I got my salad at the end of the meal,  after I got my check by the way! So I proceeded to explain that I didn't want the salad because we were already leaving and she refused to take it off of my check even though I literally received it after I got my check, i figured fine I'll deal with it. Then she charged me for all 5 pieces of byrek when I only received 3. She solved this issue by telling me I ordered 5 so that's what she charged me for, even though I only received 3. I also ordered a $9 plate and she charged me $10 for it. Basically she was so incompetent that she couldn't look at the menu and charge me the prices that were right there in front of her face.When she refused to just take a second look at my check so I could show her that i clearly had gotten over charged , she handed me a business card and told me to call her another day because she was done talking to me about what the issue was. Luckily I had cash so i paid her for exactly what i had ordered.The whole scenario of a Bosnian themed place is mediocre,  it looks dirty and not well kept. They had sesame street, wrapping paper table cloths, who the hell uses wrapping paper as a table cloth. The table was dirty when we sat down, mind you we were the only table they had initially. There was an employee drinking beer while he was working. This place was a disaster. It's extremely pitiful because the food wasn't half bad but i can not tell you how horrible these employees were especially the waitress who could not even comprehend a 9 key register and spoke 25% of the English language. She should seriously be in the back of the store so you wouldn't have to see that horrible wretched face of hers. I'm in the same line of work, and if I ever treated someone who came to my restaurant with that kind of utter disrespect I would fire myself! !

"Is it just me or do restaurants in Montreal just like to take their sweet timeArriving after 8 with a party of 12, we were told that it was a busy night but things shouldn't be much later than usual.. fair enough.After our server skipped passed us many many times assuming that we were waiting for some people when we had told him we weren't waiting.... we put in our food.I ordered a green salad  $6 and there was NOTHING in it except greens that seemed like it had come from a boxed salad from Costco. I had asked for a large portion but he indicated that it was quite big, forming  a ball. Too bad this ball was pretty much full of air as the greens had no extras - cucumber, onion, tomato... JUST GREENS.While our table was split into 2 groups of 6, the consistency of service was terrible. Table 1 got appies, and approximately 5 minutes after, table 2's main course had come out.... which is understandable because they must've been super hungry (probably after 9). As we were finish our appies, our server said that he didn't want to rush us and asked if we would like our main courses to be put in. We were so hungry - of course yes. We thought he was going to bring out our main courses.... but NO. he had not even punched the order into the kitchen yet! ......... it was probably another 40 minutes before Table 1's mains came out, and by then Table 2 is already eating dessert. We were so hungry to the point that we were not even hungry anymore. When we called the waiter over, he looked so nervous and had no answers for us as he hurried back into the kitchen in the hopes to get us something to eat.. let me say that all our food options were either raw, rare, or lightly seared. Not sure what took so long.The mains came out probably 10:30. We were not hungry anymore. My salmon tartare with avocado and lemon oil was sub par. It was 2 3 avocado puree and the lemon oil tasted like water. Although other people thought the food was good, I could have really had a good meal elsewhere without the wait time.Not going to write anymore. There's nothing more to say. The thought of thinking about this makes me sad.

"If you are in the mood for rude service, from a manager nonetheless, then this is the place for you. We had a party of 12 come here for dinner. We ordered food (not that great), appetizers and plenty of drinks. On their menu, it clearly says that drinks with double alcohol are $8, which we thought was quite the deal. So two friends of mine had two drinks, with double alcohol each. Totalling 4. Still with me Good. So when the bill came, you'd think the two drinks per person would be $16 each. No. They neglect to tell you that it's $8 per alcohol shot, not the entire drink. So those two drinks ended up costing a hefty $32 per person! When this was brought up to the waitress, she brought over the manager who was a rude little french troll. He was sarcastic, loud and didn't know what it meant to please the customer. After explaining why we were charged that much, he just wouldn't listen to our explanation of how deceiving their menu is when it comes to that drink special. It just didn't get into his thick skull. At one point, sarcastically he said ""what do you want me to do, call the owner at home and have him come explain this to you"". Fellow yelper Lourdes W. gave him a piece of her mind saying how rude he was being and that he had no tact. He needed to address his customer's concerns in a respectful manner and appease us since we spent quite alot of money with a party of 12. This shut him up and we decided to just pay the bill and leave. For sure my friend will be calling their credit card to contest the charge. Say what you want about America and it's customer service skills, but something like this would have never happened in the states. Our economy may be in the gutter and our crime rate may be increasing but pleasing the customer at restaurants is something that is always honored wherever you go. Stay away from this dump.

"Me and my lady went here new year's day because there were not too many places open.  We got seated right away, but then waited 20 minutes until someone aknowledged us.  Couldn't even flag anyone down because they stuck us in the corner.  This was same for 2 other couples that got seated near us.Finally ordered drinks and food...30 minutes later food came; it was not appealing at all and way overpriced.  Burger was gray all the way through and hard.  salad was drenched with dressing.  Everyone sitting in our vacinity were aggravated and some got up and left.I asked for the bill; it took another 15 minutes to get that.  Then I waited for the waitress to come back to make change so that I didn't have to leave her a tip.Here's a tip for anyone considering going to Boccacino's... Don't bother.If I can stop one person from eating here, then this review was a success!

"Wow does Yelp offer 0 stars. I didn't get a chance to even see the food but based on the other reviews I am probably not missing much. This is my first time in Montreal I flew up for the weekend from Virginia. I had a 3 am flight and arrived here around noon and was extremely hungry. After walking around I noticed this place and walked in. My girlfriend and I walked into a busy atmosphere and a couple of guys behind us walked in as well. The hostess was working on getting a table for a woman in front of us and completely took off before acknowledging we had walked in. Then to make room I walked closer to the hostess desk and another woman walked up and the d-bags behind me started speaking French and the woman wrote them down. They didn't even tell the woman I was there first.  So then she proceeds to not know how to speak English which is be of the two languages of this country. While the real hostess was being useless this woman misspelled my name as she was taking my information and I told her I was here before those two guys and she said no I wasn't. What a piss poor manager place and I dare the manager or owner to contact me so I can tell him how rude is staff is at the door. If you are traveling avoid this place like the plague. I'm sure Montreal has plenty to offer and even though so d-bags have already ruined my experience here even though us Americans can be rude we still know our place and don't treat tourist like sh*t.

"Was my fourth visit to their outside deck conveniently located in the center of the city. Saturday evening at 7:00pm, Service was non-existent , the reason was the wait staff was drinking and partying inside, outside on the deck and on the sidewalk! Drinking beer and doing ""shots"" at the tables with other patrons !! Doing shots from table to table. They were rude and loud and obviously drunk. I waited for a menu, waited for a long time for dinner to be served. Our waitress said she would check on our meal, but we watched her and she never did. Finally it arrived, standard fare nothing special. But the drunken non caring wait staff was apalling!!

"I went in for breakfast, as they were one of the few open this early on a weekend morning. Walking in, the ambience is very nice. However, this is as much compliments I can give. I ordered a standard breakfast (eggs, toast, sausages, and potatoes). First off, service is slow. It took around 15 minutes to get my food, and it was not busy this early in the morning. The toast was burnt. The eggs were still a bit raw. The hash browns were just a pile of grease. The sausages were bland. All the while, no one offered a refill of my coffee. Lastly, the price I paid for this is absolutely overpriced. Honestly, I would much prefer going to IKEA, spending a dollar for breakfast and expecting mediocre, instead of my experience here.

"Remarkably unprofessional!  From the moment you walk in, at least one of the receptionists is pleasant, another is a complete loud mouth, and the things that come out of her mouth are absolutely rude and ridiculous.Thanks to ""loud mouth"", I've learned (in detail) that the Director of Nursing at this facility is having an affair with one of the male staff members.  Can you imagine waiting to greet your loved one and learning about such shenanigans  All from your seat in reception!This, combined with very poor bed-side mannerisms, and the fact that I've met this DON (and she is HORRIBLY unfriendly) told me that the facility is not fit to care for my mother, and we pulled her out after just a few months!Please do your loved ones a favor, do not send them to this sham!

"My father was a resident in this nursing home for almost two years.  The care he received was inconsistent and disappointing, to say the least.  I found that some staff members were professional and caring, but the majority of the CNAs who interact with the patients on a daily basis were unprofessional and severely lacking in bedside manners. I strongly recommend exploring other facilities if you are in need of care for yourself or a loved one.  There are places out there with caring, competent staff members that far exceed TLC in quality.  This place has so-so reviews on medicare.gov.  They may be able to check basic boxes, but when it comes to personalized attention and compassion, they have a long way to go.

"Very unprofessional and sketchy staff - all the other yelp reviews will confirm this.You know a nursing home is bad when you call to get information on your family member who is receiving care and the rudeilliterate nurse you get a hold of refuses to identify themselves - won't even give you their first name.  What kind of nursing home hires people like thatLater we found out my family member ended up hospitalized due to dehydration.  They refused to assist my family get information about his care after he was ""discharged"" - that was the word they kept throwing around even to my family member while he was still there waiting for an ambulance.If you are considering placing a family member in this facility, read these reviews and also this news story: http:www.8newsnow.comstory23140454nursing

"Don't know wherehow to start this review - I will start with, if you can find ANY other place to send your family members for care, it would be in your best interest to do so.  My moms insurance company gave her no choice to go here.  Repeatedly I arrive to visit her and she is in a wet diaper and has been for a very long time due to the smell. I lost my cool and a nice person (wish I could remember her name, great smile, not a nurse, someone with authority) told me should would find someone to help.  She stopped a man in the hall and he gave her instructions to find a nurse.  Later I found out this man was the ADMINISTRATOR and he passed my need for help onto someone else.  In a nutshell, don't bother making a complaint the director of nursing will NOT return phone calls. Her name is Donna and the nurse who told me her name told me not to tell anyone that she told me her name as she would be fired. I could go on but it makes me more angry to think about it. Positves, clean facility, allows healthy pets to visit, decent food. Cons, unhappy nurses, poor care, no one who can help will listen at the management level.

"I am giving this place zero stars.  My grandmother was sent to this hell hole, to build and regain strength. After being at TLC for almost 10 days,  my grandma had been vomiting large amount of green vomit for days, Her blood pressure was finally checked and it was so low, they rushed her to Er. My grandma is now laying in ICU, with the worst Pneumonia one can have. All of this is caused by lack of staff members doing what they are paid to do. ( Care for the patients) When my grandma arrived at the ER, photos were taken of her bed sores, and amounts of green vomit. My grandma was severely dehydrated, mal nourished , and know where near where  the recovery she should have been.According to several staff members at the hospital my grandma is currently at, say that TLC is well known for all of their neglect. I will go to my grave fighting to have TLC's doors closed and pray that all staff members get what they deserve when they need care someday.I am aware that when we get older, we will pass. There is no reason to take years away from anyone, due to laziness. This place has messed with the wrong family this time.

"After being admitted to this facility my elderly friend received a few days treatment and then was constantly badgered to sign into a hospice facility called Solari. She was told by TLC that she could stay there up to 100 days. Then suddenly, after less than 2 weeks she was told she had to leave...period, no notice. Once again the Solari rep showed up only this time she stated that she could only stay 2 days in Solari. Moved her the following day. TLC on site social worker was usually no where to be found and never returned her calls or the many pages the receptionist made for her stating ""I know she's here, I don't know why she's not responding"".Avoid this place at any costs!

"My father passed away early this week at the Silver Ridge Healthcare Center after a 9 year bout with cancer. It was his dying wish not to pass at home while he was in home hospice care so when the medical staff tending to him announced that he only had hours left, arrangements were made to have him transferred to a hospice based facility. I hope and pray that if you (the reader) are ever faced with sending a family member or friend to a facility like this - that you have other options because Silver Ridge is one of the worst facilities I've encountered after years of working in Healthcare. I waited a few days to post this so it wouldn't seem like an emotional response to my father's passing - I truly hope that no one ever has to experience what I experienced here.To start off - I could have raised hell but that wasn't my purpose for being there. I was there, with my family to be with my father in his last remaining hours. But, from the moment I stepped foot into the facility, I encountered the most cold, uncaring and unprofessional staff ever. I intentionally used the word ""encountered"" because not one person ever approached my family. Not one asked if we needed anything. Not one offered any explanation of the procedures and or rules of the facility. Not one gave us the time of day when coming by to check his vitals or drop off equipment, which incidentally, was never used. It was so bad that when the transport team arrived to transfer my father to his assigned bedroom - one of them had to go and hunt down a tree so they could connect the oxygen lines. When I finally wanted to know what the hell was going on, I find three of their staff just sitting at the station having a non work related conversation. There were problems with the meds that my father was prescribed but it wasn't entirely the facility's fault - but no one on their staff, took the initiative to try to remedy the situation. Meds at facility are brought in via a mobile pharmacy team however, all facilities have systems in place for meds they need stat and this place was not exception. After a brief conversation with the admitting nurse, and some pointed accusations about how inept their staff was coming across - she managed to contact the right people to pull the meds from their Pyxis machine that had the meds my father was prescribed, in stock. Almost two hours after my father was placed. At one point, one of the nurses came in to take my father's vitals. Both my sister and I were sitting bedside and not only didn't she even greet us or explain what she was doing - when asked what his stats were, she didn't even answer - she only turned the monitor so I could see the readout. The patient next door - didn't speak English. I don't know what language he spoke however, the staff on the third shift, had zero patience for dealing with him. At one point, one of the nurses was arguing with him because of the language barrier. I don't understand how someone in Healthcare doesn't know how to use the free translation services offered to help prevent circumstances like what I witnessed that night. It's a matter of a making a toll free call. I could go on about this place however, there were some things you would just have to see for yourself. For example, the unsanitary restrooms - where soiled adult diapers were overflowing from the trash cans onto the floor. There were also some spills that weren't cleaned from the patients who had the pleasure of roaming the halls. I will close on this - when my father passed, not one word was said to my family by the staff. It's not like there wasn't time nor opportunity. Waiting for the mortuary service to pick him up took about 90 minutes. Even the transport driver was sympathetic enough to offer condolences. I remained silent about what I witnessed first hand at first. This isn't the only arena I intend on voicing my concerns. I over see hospital operations on a much larger level than this facility but the term ""Healthcare"" should be universal everywhere. Until the facility's management address the issues here, I'd recommend you avoid this place if you need to place a loved one there for care.

"Update:I find it absolutely amazing that a person can pass away at their facility - then one day short of 7 weeks later, someone from that facility is calling for the deceased, asking to speak with them regarding paperwork that needs to be completed. That's definitely a textbook procedure of making sure the family of the deceased isn't reminded of the passing - Also just goes to show how uninvolved the clinicalnursing staff was with my dad's brief stay and passing at this facility. Seeing as no one from that facility gave me nor my family any attention - that they would miss that someone actually passed away, or who it was. I'd save a copy of the voice mail and send it to the facility administrators or the risk management team - however, with the attitudes and behavior I witnessed from their staff there that night - and now with the voice mail I just listened to - I'm sure they wouldn't care.I'm moving on and putting this all behind me after this review. I'd suggest that you just keep moving on if you ever find this place as an option for care - for yourself, anyone you know or love and even your enemies.

"SNR is a somewhat older facility but we went with this one given the staggeringly bad reviews the other one got. My grandma in law fell from being weak from a UTI and had to be transferred to a rehabilitation to recover and get stronger.  It seemed really great at first but it was the luck of the draw we got a really lovely RN and CNA team the first few days and then the shifts changed. Overall the care for someone who can't ask for help as well as others was inadequate.  There were some wonderful people along the way that we really liked and we expressed so much gratitude to them for their kindness. Then there was the polar opposite that have yelled at us for requests that I feel were reasonable. One lady go mad at being told to be more gentle with grandma as she fell and being turned so quickly hurts. One got mad at being asked an hour later if she got the ice water and can change grandma before leaving. When we've been there for 12 hours and want to go home and said so when making the request, I would hope to get stuff in a reasonable time, not an hour later ask to be yelled at that not everything can happen at a snap of demands. World doesn't revolve around us. Some things can't be helped, I'm not unreasonable. I've heard complaints down the hall of how spread thin people can be. Too many people assigned to a person - I sympathize and not OK with how the bottom dollar comes into play with quality care. It fucks staff and patients. If you can speak for yourself and press your button, then you'll be fine. If you can speak for yourself also be considerate of how much time you take for your trivial BS. One of our neighbors was a princess and spent so much time demanding and berating the staff that maybe if they didn't get beatdown they would care more, and have more time for what matters.I think though even in that, prioritize. When someone has a UTI and is too weak to get up, don't leave them in their waste all night. Grandma got some serious rashes from this....and things didn't change with some people. It's totally not OK that it takes us being posted up at the rehab to make sure she was being cared for.The weekend director was wonderful and when she was around, my MIL got somewhere with asking for some better priority treatment of the rashes and to get grandma on IVs and better meds. The physical therapist did all they can daily. Their case worker is a very sweet woman that lead us down to hospice as a option.At the end of it, we saw she was in pain and giving up on us. The person who came in declined and didn't want this anymore. We made the decision to bring her to hospice for adequate care. Our thought process is they would take better care of her there, and discharge her to at home comfort care. I think her spirit was broken, she didn't want to go on and she left us 48 hours after leaving this facility and was thanking us for getting her out after the hospice immediately did in 11 minutes what didn't happen here for 11 days. There they bathed her, made her comfortable the moment she arrived. Of course the maybes play into my head. If we had better care from the start, I think she would have been better off...

"Functional Performance is a clean and well equipped physical therapy clinic in Tempe. The staff are friendly, but they are overloaded with patients and give you very little attention. The owner is pretty arrogant and is very flirtatious with some of the female clients. He barely listened to me when I came in and had me continue doing exercises that I told him were causing me pain until I ended up with a bad injury from the physical therapy. Months later I am still injured and never received so much as an apology. I would never recommend Functional Performance to anyone.

"Shelly is a good therapist, very professional. I totally recommend her. On the other hand, Derek (who is the owner) does not take enough time to find out about his patients' condition and give them an appropriate treatment. I got a bad injury while receiving PT under his supervision, and his excuse was that he had a lot of patients at that time and that me coming to PT at that hour was not the best idea... why did they schedule me and all those other patients in the first place if the therapist can't deal with that All I got from him was an apology and an even worse injury.

"Avoid Sante like the plague!!  They do not care about their patients and are only interested in your money.  My grandma has COPD and went to Sante after having been hospitalized a few days to ""build back up her strength"" well the complete opposite happened.  They lied to us and did not inform us that no one on staff knew how to use a bipap machine; therefore, after being there a couple of days her Co2 levels rose and her oxygen levels declined sending her right back to the hospital.  After she was back doing well and could be released from the hospital once again, Sante apologized for the incident and assured us that they would now know how to properly work it and care for her.  We mistakenly once again had her go there.  She was doing great; however, they were not able to work the bipap yet again and did nothing to get another machine or anything.  After being there a week and off the bipap my grandma went downhill overnight.  We told them that she needed to go to the hospital; however, they did not take us seriously.  They did not allow my grandma to go to the hospital as she was asking to go along with us.  They told her that she did not want to go to the hospital because you know what happens there.  Well they neglected to even call 911 even when in the middle of the night her oxygen levels dropped into the 60's.  Nothing got done until my dad went by the next morning and immediately told them to call the ambulance.  They listened only because they thought that he was a dr.  They were clueless and didn't even know who the dr.'s were just as they are clueless when it comes to providing care.  All that they were good for was popping pills down my grandma's throat.  All thanks to Sante my grandma is worse off now than before and is fighting for her life this very moment.  I highly suggest avoiding Sante at all costs.  They lie, don't care properly for their patients, and are only money hungry.  If you love your loved one do not allow them to so much as set a foot in this facility!!

"I now understand where the name comes from. Yesterday I went into Dick's to buy my daughter some shirts. As we were checking out I noticed a bin that was full of bags that had sports watches and body bands to monitor vital signs. I started going through them to find a watch that would meet my workout needs. Most of the bags that contained these watches were missing something. Not a problem because the outside clearly noted what was wrong with the package. It said things like "" missing manual or dead battery"" I found a watch that was missing a manual. I went online and looked up the watch and it had what i was looking for. I purchased the watch as is and took it home. After trying to sync the watch to the body strap monitor for an hour, I went online and found that the watch that i have takes an analog strap and the one that was in this bag was digital. I went back to the store today to swap out the wrong band for the correct on. I was told that i had to speak to Nicole the store manager. I was directed to Nicole who was assisting another customer. After standing patiently waiting for Nicole while the customer and Nicole discussed trading in his older wife for two younger ones, I got annoyed. I went back to the counter to find a different manager. I was told that Nicole is it. I waited some more. After waiting for Nicole for 15 minutes and listening to conversation that had nothing to do with products or services she asked how she could help me. I explained the situation and showed her the online picture of what i was supposed to receive with my purchase and she told me that they take everything out of the original package and put them into the bags that they sell these in.   i pointed out that as people look through the bag,   watches are being mixed up. I showed her Timex watches with Polar band and bags with two watches and no bands. Some watches had no bags at all and were sitting in the bottom of the bin with other loose manuals and straps. After going through each bag, I could not find the correct band. Someone is walking around with a digital watch with an analog band. I asked if i could purchase a more expensive watch and just pay the difference. Nicole said no. I get ""as is"" but I purchased it because the issue that was advertised on the packaging was it was missing the manual. It did not say that the accessories in the packaging do not match and the watch can not be used for anything except time and date.Now I have to pay for a new band as well as pay for shipping which is going to be more expensive than buying the watch at the original retail price. Thank you for horrible customer service and a useless watch.Pissed of Morrison Family YMCA Soccer Dad

"I've been to several Dick's sporting good stores and this one is by far one of the worst. A few years ago I took my mountain bike to them for a basic service. Upon picking it up I realized that my high end pedals had been switched with some of the ones they use on their floor. I brought this up to the staff's attention who didn't hesitate in saying that I was wrong and they don't do that. I asked to speak to the manager an nobody was there from the management staff. I asked them to go review their security footage and they said they didn't want to do that either. I took this issue up their corporate ladder and all they did was apologized.I since stopped frequenting them. Sadly due to lack of options from a similar retailer in the areaI had to visit this location again recently, I had a backpack on as I rode there in my motorcycle. I walked in the store and started headed to the department I was needing, I was stopped by a rather unpleasant employee who told me I could not be in the store with a backpack due to recent theft issues. I told her that I had been in other dick's sporting goods and was never made aware of such rule. I also informed her that there was no signage stating that as I walked in the store. She continued to state that I could either give them my backpack or I could leave the store!!!!I told her that neither option worked and that she could inform her security staff to watch me on camera or have someone follow me around as I did not feel comfortable giving them my backpack which had my valuables in it.This brand has high prices and the staff isn't very knowledgeable nor very pleasant. They are definitely missing the point of retail on so many levels it's pathetic.I wish there were other options of stores similar to them in the area.

"Today, I had a terrible experience at Monona's Village Pedaler. i arrived at 10am as the shop opened. I needed to simply pump up a tire on my nephew's bike. I had trouble getting to the air value due to a spoke that was a little to snug to the value. Very simple issue....I walked in and there was a white lady getting her bike fixed. Another white lady and a white gentleman came in after me. The first lady bike was serviced. I was clearly next. The guy working there looked past me and serviced the white lady before me! It was clear that I was next, but he didn't serve me. I patiently waiting thinking something was strange. He then asked me what I needed. I explained and we walked to the pump. He started to pump the air into the value, stopped 12 way through, and went to help the white gentleman. He just left me standing there. He got a set of tires for the man and left me wondering what I had done. I walked back in the shop wondering what was going on. I stood next to the gentleman. As the worker charged the man's credit card in the front of the store, the customer looked at me and apologized for the man working. He thanked me for my patience and went along. Again, we went to the pump and the worker finished pumping up the front tire. I proceeded to ask him if he would squeeze the back tire to see if it needed air too. He refused to do it, telling me that I 'should know how to do it.' He told me that 'this is a simply life skill that I should already know how to do'. Huh I said, 'In your professional opinion, would you suggest that I add more air to the tire'. He replied with a short, crisp, snotty attitude, ""you feel the front tire and it (the back tire) needs air, do it"". Wow!!!!!...and he walked back in the store, leaving me by myself. I'm serious, I stood there shocked and wondering what was happening.I am an African American professional who wanted to take my nephew on his first Monona-lake bike ride. I didn't deserve service like this. If you don't support discriminatory business, stay away from this shop! He didn't need to treat me with such disregard. They don't deserve your money. Stay away and tell your friends to not support this shop.

"I was purchasing a book for a class that I was unsure about staying in. While checking out, I asked the sales clerk what the return policy was and she completely ignored me. I asked a second time and she acted like I wasn't there and continued ringing me up. My friend, who was with me in line, sees slips of paper behind the register with the return policy on it and takes one since it was obvious that the cashier was not going to speak to us and points out that the return deadline for all text books was a few weeks away. I complete the transaction and leave. After I drop the class and try to return the unused book two days later, I'm told that the item is nonreturnable. The manager pointed out the fine print in the return policy that listed many types of books that were nonreturnable. There were many paragraphs of text on their return policy and the part that listed the deadline for book returns was no where near the part that stated my book was nonreturnable. I pointed out that the cashier completely ignored my question about the return policy and the manger, beaming with pride, tells me that they train their employees to not answer any questions about their return policy! I don't need to explain how absurd that is. He goes on to explain that they ""[...] expect our customers to know how to read."" What does TIS expect us to know how to read, the lengthy return policy that is not provided to the purchaser until *after* they check out unless they simply reach around the register and take one There are very good reasons why they don't provide the policy to customers--even when asked. Besides being able to sell books to students unsure about staying in their classes--if even a small number of customers took the time to read the lengthy return policy before they check out, the line would be hours long rather than the mere 45 minutes that it took for us. TIS is as sleazy as they come. Save some money and order online!

"I wish I could give 0 stars. Two days ago I purchased an iClicker here for $57.50 including tax. This afternoon I attempted to return the unopened product with the original receipt. I was told they could offer me $19.00 for it, as it was considered a ""textbook"" (for the record, an iClicker is an electronic device made of plastic and metal, and made up of 0% paper) and therefore not eligible for return after August, despite the fact that I had purchased it in September and not during August at all. The cashier who checked me out at the time of purchase also did not inform me that I would not be able to return it. In short, HORRIBLE customer service and I feel they take advantage of basically broke college students. Thanks for nothing TIS and I will be telling everyone I know not to shop here.

After all aren't we the customers  The prices are outrageous...AND finally - i had 2 dresses that I entrusted to them for adjustments. Let's say - they are both COMPLETELY unusable. Why well, my butt is nearly exposed on one of the dresses. (not exaggerating). And the other - is terrible.....I would not recommend them to anyone... very very truly disappointed as I could use a good honest knowledgeable helpful tailor. seamstress....

"To start, I have seen this shop many times, as I frequent two great restaurants next door.  A few months ago, my fiance and I stopped into the store to get an idea on a suit for me for our up coming wedding.  We first met the son, who was very nice and knowledgeable.  I recently returned to the shop when it was time to finally purchase a suit as our wedding is getting close.  I was helped by Maragita, and sold a nice suit. She initially gave me a good deal, and I felt satisfied with the experience.  LET ME TELL YOU HOW THINGS CHANGED ONCE THEY'VE GOT YOUR MONEY!!!!! The suite was ordered from the manufacturer, and arrived about ten days later. When I went to pick it up, I tried it on for any necessary alterations.  I was quoted an extra $115 to make it fit.  Now I understand all suits need some alterations, but this was major work needed.  I took the suit, to get some comparison quotes to fit it, which were cheaper.  I decided to return to the shop to see if the would work with me in coming to an arrangement since I was not happy with the way the experience was going.  A $200 suit, now was costing me $315, when i was under the impression that any alterations were included.  I expressed my displeasure with Margarita, who became very defensive.  I explained that I felt lead a stray in buying the suit since I tried the pants on in front of her and she knew how much alterations the would need.  I understand that alterations are time consuming and people aren't going to work for free.   I suggested a 50% discount and offered to pay $65, to meet me in the middle.  She did not accept this, and was unwilling to work with me at all in satisfying my displeasure.  She even had the attitude that it was some how my fault for not knowing how these things work.  I informed her that she wasn't really doing much to keep me business, and she stated that she had many happy customers and didn't need my return business.  CUSTOMER SERVICE AND SATISFACTION IS NOT A CONCERN FOR THIS STORE.  MARGARITA HAD NO INTEREST IN TRYING TO WIN MY REPEAT BUSINESS. ONCE THEY HAVE YOUR MONEY, YOU'RE OWN YOUR OWN. I WOULD NOT SUGGEST THIS SHOP TO ANYONE!!!!

"Let me start this review by saying, if I could give this place a negative 5 star rating I would. This store and it's owner are the biggest ripoff I've seen in many years. You go here to get suit's for the biggest day of your life. You set up the groomsmen party and discuss pricing. Everything is supposed to be all set for pick up right before your big day right Wrong!! The day before my wedding,  we go in to pick up the suit's and when we go to pay for the rental's, the owner Mikka does a bait and switch. We were quoted a price of 84$ for kids 12 and under and 125$ for anyone older. The owner and sales associate both claim they never said that. Now I'm in a rock and a hard place. I felt helpless, knowing I didn't have anymore time to go anywhere else. The owner Mikka was shaking in disgust that I would even challenge her. Now keep in mind, I had 10 men and 4 boys in my party.( 2 little boy's aged 2 and a 9 and 12 year old) I asked her again ""why was she trying to charge full price for children"" She then said "" the lower price was for size 12 and under not age."" So I was forced to pay the full price and left. Felling helplessness,  I reached out to my CC company, who to no avail told me there hands were tied because it was a verbal agreement not a written one.So at the end of the day, I'm left with this bill and a taste so bad in my mouth about this store and the owner. Buyer beware. Go to another store, one that will honor there verbal agreements. I will never shop with this store again and I recommend you do the same.

"Save your money!!!  You get quoted one price and get charged way more, happened not just once but twice!!!  Not worth it...

"Stitched at first impression is like meeting that perfect guy who claims to be self-made.  Successful businessman who built his company from scratch and single-handedly remembers all the details.  Well, then it turns out that the kid's really a trust-fund baby who has a housekeeper, an assistant, a cook to help him and yet he's still barely holding himself together.I was impressed with Stitched too when I first laid eyes on the store.  That prime real estate at the Cosmo, those smooth-talking salespeople, the sprinkle of designer labels, and of course, that man cave in the back with the shiny leather couches and the Scotch cabinet.The Mr. has been wanting a bespoke suit for a while now and Stitched came close to his heart's desire.  After all, they showed us Ermenegildo Zegna cloth, poured us espresso, and talked fast.  I have a keen eye for shopping and luxury goods but being that this was an experience for the Mr., I asked my OCD self to take a vacation so he can shop in peace.  That was a mistake.We purchased a suit, a jacket, and 2 pairs of pants, all together ringing the bill up to almost a hefty chunk of money, the alterations themselves about being 50 times more than I've ever paid.   After missing the first delivery date of the clothes (both of the pants were the wrong length and width as well as the jacket), here we are after barely 3 wears of the clothes and the alterations are coming apart.  It is a worst tailor job that I've ever seen, the hemming haphazardly finished and many shortcuts in sewing taken.  I can pay about 5% as much and take them somewhere else to have a better job.Go to Stitched if you're buying something that they've bought from another place (like cufflinks or pocket handkerchiefs), if you don't mind paying more and already have your bottle of Scotch parked in their cabinet.  Don't let that designer fabric selection fool you, the in-house construction will be very inferior.  And in the end, what good is luxury bricks if the build of the house is terrible!

"Called this place when I realized last minute that my maid of honor dress no longer fit and needed to be taken out. The tailor told me over the phone it wouldn't be a problem and would cost $45. Got to the store, tried the dress on, and the guy said he could change the zipper back to a corset back for $75. I agreed, as I was leaving town for the wedding in 3 days and was desperate. I changed out of the dress and all of the sudden it was now going to cost $175 to alter the dress. Really Could he have made it anymore obvious that he was trying to take advantage of me since he knew I was leaving in a few days and needed the dress Again, I agreed, out of desperation. Then, some other guy walks over, talks to the tailor in another language before laughing, walking out, and the tailor telling me he can no longer fix the dress because he doesn't have enough time and he's too busy. Are you kidding meAvoid this place. They are shady and think they can jerk around their customers just because they are in the Cosmo. Newsflash, the Cosmo is barely surviving, which means this place will sooner or later be shut down, too.

"Don't waste your money.  Bought an $1,800 suite here last September and it's already falling apart in less than 1 year.  It's LITERALLY FALLING APART.  The fabric is worn in the crotch and the seams are showing severe signs of wear and tear.  I've never had it dry cleaned and have only wore it 3-4 times per month in the last 10 months.I was initially reluctant to purchase from Stiched in the first place because of their shady reviews regarding their tailoring.  When I addressed these issues to their staff prior to my purchase the sales man used phrases like ""we have new tailors"", ""those are old reviews"", and ""we now have the best tailors on the strip"". Don't be fooled!  When trying to come to an amicable resolution with the manager 10 months later, he too said ""I'm sorry and we stand behind our product"".  This was B.S. because he didn't care about resolving this issue in a reasonable manner.  Shame on you Stiched.  I've had suits from the Men's Wearhouse that have lasted much longer. The only resolution that the manager offered was that he'd sell me another pair of pants (that won't match the existing jacket) at a discounted price.  I'm sorry but this is completely unacceptable.  I will never buy from Stiched again nor would I recommend you gamble with their product.

"Have been going to the Pennsylvania Macaroni Company for years. Love their fresh pasta and great selection of cheeses. Always great service, however today was the exception. Rudest woman at the cheese counter. Then went to get the fresh pasta and the woman behind the counter was downright nasty. She was covering the pasta at 4:00, they close at 4:30 and I asked her if it was to late to get pasta. She rolled her eyes at me and said uh yeah-we are putting it away right now. A simple yes or no would have been nice. I said ok thanks anyway. Then she must have reconsidered and said well did you want something In a very rude voice. Needless to say I walked away. Wow! Pennsylvania Macaroni Company needs to work on customer service. Obviously she hates her job, then get another one! If I didn't drive so far to get there I wouldn't have written this review. Every January I buy 3 months worth of cheese for my family members. I won't be doing that anymore.

"Stopped by this market was actually looking for the u pick peaches place.  Went into the store some of the veggies looked old.  Found 2 strawberries & a couple tomatoes, went to the counter checked out and she said $3.01 but the store charges $.50 to use a debit or credit card so it was $3.51 I said oh I did not see that I have cash in my purse and the lady said it already went through.  I explained I did not know they charged a fee and she spouted off it cost me $.90 and very unprofessional said do you want your $.50 back. I understand business & costs and this is one I will now AVOID.

"Some great food, some very old shelf food and some miserable people behind the counter.I can't recall a place that had more unfriendly people waiting on you.  They apparently hate working here.  I can't blame them.  They are cramped up inside this small space that looks like something out of Alfred Hitchcock's film Spellbound.I once accidentally asked for a certain number year cheddar and they about pulled a gun out from under the counter and shot me.  ""WHAT!  THERE IS NO SUCH THING!""  My mistake, I mean 7 year cheddar.  I  had accidentally used the price in place of the year.Never a thank you, never a friendly chit chat at check out.  Here ya go.  Ugghh.  I really hate this place but the cheese and sausage are good.Apparently I wrote this when the place was closed for repairs.   Didn't mean to add insult to injury.   But my comments were on the staff not so much the food.   I am hopeful that all of the old shelf food went up in flames.   If I return I won't worry about what I buy from the shelf.   What I said about the staff is true.   I have never seen a smile in this place..

"Just left early from Arizona Opera Lucia Di Lammermoor. It was horrible. I felt like I was at a high school production! Their is no sound production and the performers do not wear mikes. So you are in a fairly large hall (the symphony hall to be exact) and all you can hear are these tiny voices from the stage. I could've had the same experience watching it on my IPad. DO NOT waste your hard earned money. They should be ashamed to pretend this is a true opera!

"So i'm going to start out by saying I know we are in a recession and money is tight but this was the worst mini golf course that I have ever seen. I loved that when we walked in all the arcade games were shut off and didn't work....probably because our round of mini golf only costed $12 for the 2 of us. We proceeded to the course which was a total joke. The turf was totally beat up, the staging and props looked condemned, and at one point I smelt something that resembled a dead body or animal. At one point I bet this was a nice place but the ponds that went thru the course were all dried up and not working and everything was a mess! It wasn't enjoyable and we were very disappointed, Spend the extra couple dollars and go to crackerjax or castle n coasters.

"I feel bad for the people who get suckered into this place after seeing their photoshopped pictures online.  This place is on par with a Days Inn, and is by no means a resort.My issue was the ownership and staff.  If you want to feel like you are the biggest inconvenience to walk through the front door, then this is your place! Also, I have no idea how their gym survives. They discourage gym-only membership and the fees are ridiculous ($549 initiation fee, plus $100 monthly fee).  I guess that's why the place is completely dead. Oh well, the equipment is old anyways.  Anyways, this place is a big NOPE! Nope nope nope

"This hotel is beyond disgusting- be sure to read the tripadviser reviews also. If you book this through a discount place like I did (Expedia), you will regret it. Janice at the front desk looks like a Walmart shopper, with a rude tone as well.  We were shown a room (standard) that smelled like urine with one 2X3 window overlooking the parking lot. The lobby had a used Q-tip behind the chair and garbage strewn about. Place is worn, and tired.

"I don't know where to begin we checked in on a Fri night in April the place was empty maybe 4-5 cars in entire place,front desk lady was talking to a guest on phone who wanted to come in that night instead of Saturday and she told them they couldn't because there were no clean rooms. We went to the coffee shop restaurant and the steak didn't taste right , didn't think too much about it until morning, Our room was dark lights are all dim and room is yellow & brown tones, I had to sleep on the pull out sofa bed, the sheets were dirty with crumbs, could tell the bed was never made,I slept on top of blanket, in morning I got up to make coffee the pot was there but no coffee filters to be able to use the pot,took a shower and only one towel in the whole place, we had two booked in our room don't understand why one towel Decided to go back to restaurant for breakfast how bad can you screw up breakfast and again place was empty but another couple were leaving they made a comment about the service, said he ordered steak and eggs  but steak was bad and they were walking out he complained how his room had one towel ! we said so did ours... confirmation now the night before we thought steak tasted funny. We overheard the waiter tell a table there is ""No milk"" they were out, its 9AM on a Saturday morning ! Coffee came in a styrofoam cup in the restaurant ! We walked out, checked out they didn't charge us for the room after we showed them 5 old cigarette butts on our non smoking dirty room balcony and pictures of the bed sheets. Too bad, has lots of potential but no service, rooms are like an apartment but dreary, pool looked okay but not sure where you would find a towel, place looks like its being run on a dime budget and I wonder if the owner knows the person at front desk is turning guests away from checking in. I would say there must be at least 75 rooms and literally there were maybe 10 cars in the parking lot .In need of an overhaul. Front desk said manager would call us but he never did.. Not a resort more like an old condo time share next to a tennis club.

"There are much better and cheaper options for gyms in the tempe area.  My biggest complaints are the lack of cleanliness and the overall condition. The lobby and general areas all look nice, but I've often found the locker rooms to be dirty. Additionally, the cardio machines are often sticky and sweaty. Gross!On the plus side, the pool is great, and it's large enough that finding a machine isn't a problem. My biggest complaint has come after I cancelled my membership. I get almost weekly calls, letters, and emails asking me to re-join. I've asked to be removed from their mailing list, but it doesn't seem to work. Somehow the message of ""Leave me alone... I'm happy with my new gym"" isn't getting through!

I've decided to try to find a new gym because I don't want to get sick here.Besides all that, what's up with the toilet seat covers!  They're there one week and gone the next.

"Really like the gym most of the time,  except for the Kid's Club.  If you have kids younger than school age,  this gym is not for you.  They have a time limit... which they don't bother to mention prior to getting you to join.  Then if you ""go over"" 3 times,  your membership is suspended.   I have not even been able to go over to the weight lifting section of the gym after 3 weeks of membership - thanks to the kids club.   Also, have to leave classes early which is disruptive i.e. in yoga..... again.. thanks to kids club.  The girls who work there are snotty and make snide remarks if you are even a couple of minutes late.    I have written a letter to ""corporate"", but I am told that I will never get a response.   So.... once again... as a single working mother with child... I feel that I am paying more than the average person to work out there.. plus I am not able to work out as long as other people who pay less.   Completely frustrating.   I signed up for 800.00 worth of Summer Kids Camps...which I have subsequently withdrawn from due to the bad attitude of the Kid's Club employees.   So.. if you don't have kids... the gym would be great.

"Beware of this gym!!! I put my membership on hold because of an injury and they said I still owe them money. I finally said OK and went into pay and canceled my account. I received an email for another bill that was still owe. They told me I didn't sign something. I said the employee never ask me to sign something. Oh well they are very unwilling to work with someone and are very RUDE!!!! I will tell as many people as I know to never use Lifetime because there service lacks any kind of common sense.

"Horrible experience!!! For the past 20yrs, I've always belonged to a gym. This was the worst, ever! I started by signing up with a personal trainer (he was awesome) however, I ended up having major hand surgery on both hands and was unable to finish my last 4 sessions. After many attempts to speak to someone and I'm talking weeks for someone to get back with me. LTF refused to reimburse me for he last 4 sessions! I also feel like $120 a month for a single person is way over the limit, especially for a gym that has out dated equipment. I belonged to Lowes YMCA ($65 a month) and that gym makes LTF look like a dump!

"I signed up for this gym over a year ago on a month by month basis.  The gym and staff are great.  however, upon losing my job, i was told i need to send a letter asking for cancellation.

Each person i talk to on the phone says i need to mail a letter or they cant cancel.  they also say that they need 30 days notice to cancel.  This is a scam to keep you going from month to month and to keep taking your money.   In total they have stolen $1500 from me and my family.  I have contacted corporate and they say they have done nothing wrong and can't help.  ""the money is for access to they gym, it doesn't matter that you haven't been to the gym in over a year.

I've been to other facilities where we could bring an umbrella stroller (for a 1-year-old) but here-no dice.  Which is made more unfortunate because it's not posted anywhere.  We had to show up to find out.  They also don't have any walkers for inexperienced skaters-so two of my kids who were looking forward to it couldn't do much.  At least my 7 year old had fun.

"I really wanted to like this place. Great reviews and a renovated priory--what a great idea! The pictures on the website are beautiful.We found a grumpy old man at the front desk, and he could not have been less interested in our arrival. It felt like we were disturbing him to ask for our room key. But the fun started when we returned later in the evening. We found the rollaway we had requested (and paid for) not present, and I went back down to the old gentleman. He stared at me and then went back to pecking at his computer. I waited. Suddenly he looked up at me and started yelling, something to the effect that there wasn't anything that he could do, and that he would see if someone could do something but probably not. He also angrily admitted that the reservation did show the rollaway.I slunk away with my guest who had by now come down, too, embarrassed and insulted. It shouldn't be this way. If this is personalized service, I'd rather stay at a motel.Even without grumpy old man, there's nothing special about this place. The rooms were ok, but the bathrooms tiny (I guess they should be called showerrooms). Everything else was sub-par. The dining room breakfast was served in was tacky and the coffee awful. We did not dare try the free wine. The hotel is in a bad neighborhood.For the money, find a special at the William Penn on the Omni Hotels website. If you want a boutique hotel, try the Inn on the Mexican War Streets--a beautiful building with friendly owners just across from the National Aviary and that beautiful park. The Priory does not feel boutique and is not worth the hassle.Priory, get grumpy old man out of a customer-facing role.

"We stayed here and was initially disappointed-- being new to town, our first impression was that Pittsburgh was a very very bad town full of homeless and degenerates (the area, I find out later, is one of the worst spots in the city!).  The hotel is located across the street from a housing authority building.  Projects  UGH.  Great.  Then we were put into a ""historical"" room that was similar to that of a rundown cheap apartment-- old shower stall, moldy threadbare carpeting, lumpy squeaky bed.  I find out an hour later (after freaking out about the lo-end aspect of this room) that they have new rooms that were just recently renovated.  I asked to see the room, and then ultimately change to that room-- for a fee, of course.  About 50% more expensive.  But I pay more because NO WAY would I be able to exist in this old ""historical"" creepy room.  Finally, a regular room-- the ""renovated"" room was similar to that of an acceptable hotel room.  Why even keep this historical, old, dingy, dirty room  Do they figure unsuspecting people who don't know any better will just accept it bc they have no other choice I slept well in the ""new"" renovated room, and would have been freaked out all night in the old room. What a difference. Actually, the bed and linens were very, very comfortable.  The bathroom was nice and clean.  The room was what I expected a hotel room to be... not high end four seasons, but not cheap and nasty either. The hotel obviously had availabilities of the new, renovated rooms, so why put us in an old, unrenovated, ugly old apartment looking room If they believed in upgrading, then they would have at least gotten repeat business!! For those who are going to book here, pay more for the new rooms, or go somewhere else.  The option of staying in the old room should not be an option at all.  I don't think I will ever go back here if I ever go back to Pittsburgh.  I will stay at a chain hotel-- marriot or whatever.  What is money except a means to be comfortable and live  I will spend more next time.Breakfast was ""eh"".  It was free-- small stations of some fruit, cheese, small pastries, cereal, yougurt and two hot items:  sausage + bacon.  OJ, Cranberry, Milk and Coffee also available.  Honestly, I felt like I was in college, and watching my pennies (poor), staying here...

"We decided to have a little staycation at the Priory earlier this month.  My husband made the reservation with a special they were having for a dinner date night.  With the special, they give you a few Pittsburgh restaurants to choose from and you get a $50 voucher to that restaurant.  When my husband called the Priory, they said they would make the reservations and call us back on the time.  We never got a call about the reservation time which was annoying.  But the main issue was we checked in, talked to the girl at the front desk about having the shuttle take us to this reservation at Meat and Potatoes, and she set us up with the shuttle.  We go in the room, look around for the $50 voucher, and it's not in the room so we assumed (i know we should never assume) that it was taken care of with Meat and Potatoes when they  made our reservation.  We had a fabulous dinner at M&P, great food, great service, and the bill comes.  We asked the server about this Priory $50 voucher and he had never heard about it so the manager comes over and says they didn't give them anything but to have them call and ask for him and he'll work it out.  We called the Priory and told them this, the girl who answered gave us an attitude and said you should have asked for it.  Then refused to call M&P to talk to the manager.  She just said to pay the full bill and we can work it out when we get back to the hotel.  We gave the manager our phone and he was yelled at as well about this.  He took our word that the Priory would deliver it to him the next day and he deducted the $50 from our bill.  It was embarrassing and it wasn't the issue with the money, just the service with the priory.  This showed us two things: We won't be going back to the Priory due to the lack of service and lack of respect and we WILL be going back to M&P because their service was impeccable.

"Went to a High Tea here on Sunday.  Although the setting was lovely and the staff was welcoming, the food was nothing special, in fact, it was bad.  We were served three tea sandwiches:  egg salad, which was bland (I make a better version at home), chicken salad, nothing special either, and then a delicious spinach-artichoke bite.  Unfortunately, it was the size of a quarter, it was literally a bite.  But it was the best part of the meal!!!  (I don't think the size of all three of the sandwiches put together was as big as one piece of white bread).We were offered two types of scones:  cranberry and eggnog.   Neither was anything special, eggnog had absolutely no taste whatsoever!Then, the pastries:  we were served a gingerbread cupcake which was fine--nothing like Vanilla Pastry Shop!  A pumpkin torte, again, fine.  And a chocolate moussebrownie bite with a raspberry and candy cane on top--it was dry as a bone!  It looked as if it was on it's last legs--chocolate was turning white, mouse separated from brownie.  Yuck.  Oh yeah--I had a delicious tea from Harney and Sons (used to be sold at the Grand Floridian High Tea in Disney World), cinnamon spice!!!  Unfortunately, when I asked for more tea, they gave me new hot water and the same old tea bag! I've gone to various teas so I feel I can give a good comparison.  Not impressed at all!  Will not go back there, ever!

"Who deleted my review of SunnyledgeBack in April, I met a girl for drinks at the Sunnyledge.  We had both heard good things about the place and that they had a great martini menu.  When we arrived there, however it was a different story.  We were met at the door by the hostess (I presume) who did not take our arrival kindly and seemed annoyed that we were there.We shrugged it off and went to the bar.  The bartender was something else and it seemed as if he was on a variety of drugs. He acted as if he was on the last quaaludes in his posession and moved with a subtle grace most often reserved for Miss Universe pageant constestants.  And that's saying something.The bartender would disappear for long periods of time, during which we would hear odd sounds coming from the kitchen.  Mostly the sounds of silverware banging around.  It was as if the hostess and bartender were throwing cutlery at each other in attempts to get us to think just what the hell was going on.  We were there for about 2 hours  and during that time saw the bartender a total of 4 times.  Most of the time he was hiding out in the kitchen.  Even when it came time to get our check, it took about 15 minutes for him to return with my card.Terrible service that night from an otherwise reputable place.  I have no plans on returning.I hope this isn't deleted again, and if it is, I will make sure it's well known and will take printed copies of this and put them up around Sunnyledge and use every contact I have to get this printed in the Post Gazette and City Paper.  I have the means, I have the will.

"*For the barWhile looking for places to have Easter brunch, I saw the Sunnyledge appear several times in my searching. They no longer do easter brunch, but they do have their martini bar - which many people seem to rave about. I should have stopped to think twice upon seeing that all 5 reviews here on yelp are at least 2 years old, but I threw caution to the wind and arrived early on a Friday evening.Just getting off work, I came alone. The location is a historical landmark, a mansion built in 1889, and is the reason they deserve their single star. The mansion, from the lobby in the bar appears beautifully kept. The walls are dark and decorated with wood and stained glass. The furniture is elegant but not stuffy, and the bar was obviously once a den or a library that was converted. The bar is rather small, housing four 2-seat tables, a 4-top, and about 8 spaces at the bar. Behind the bar, light shines through a small collection of liquor bottles. The top of the bar and tables are inlaid with tile patterns and candles are spread throughout.I browsed the martini menu, not finding much that would suit my palate as it all sounded sweeter, or too far from a martini(tequila, cointreau, and orange juice is closer to a margarita than a martini - and that Jose Cuervo on your top shelf doesn't send a good impression of your margarita). I stuck with the classic, then, and ordered a basic dry gin martini without garnish. It was made quickly and without love, shaking instead of stirring, and putting it in an un-chilled glass. Not that there was much to love, while the bottles on the shelf could be called mid-range, the bottles used for my drink and for others were right out of the bottom of the barrel. Banker's Club is the gin of choice here, and Burnett's flavored vodka is the base of most of the drinks on their menu. The martini came(Not filled to the top, seems they measure precisely to include garnish), strong with little vermouth, but given the alcohol, devoid of any flavor but ethanol and a hint of citrus.I found as I drank that food is no longer available at all in the hotel as they no longer served as a restaurant, even though signage was still in place throughout the building. I quietly finished my drink and closed my tab. How much did my room temperature Banker's Club cost A cool $9.It appears that somewhere between the last two years and now, this hotel must have come upon hard times or new management. If you are staying at the hotel and need a drink, hop a cab to Walnut street. At least your hassle will be eased by a much better drink.

"This was one of the vendors that came highly recommended by my wedding Planner. She could not stress enough how great and accommodating they were. From our first meeting with their Event Coordinator, we were lead to believe that MHI would offer outside catering if they were not able to customize our menu. We wanted traditional Laotian food. They said that this was possible and so we signed. Everything that transpired from that moment went downhill. They did not keep their promise and so we had to work with the Chef to prepare our dishes. After several tastings that we were billed for (it was never stated on our contract  that we had to pay for these), the food came out ok. The final straw was 2 weeks before our wedding when we got the bill that was to be paid in full,  which was completely inaccurate. They tried to explain to us and our wedding planner what the breakdown of cost was but nothing on that invoice made sense. My planner told us to hold off on paying until she spoke to Billy, the owner. She also mentioned that they had allowed a couple to pay on the day of so we should be ok. After several back and forth, we decided to proceed on the payment even though we didn't agree with the amount.  MHI Planner emailed us midday and said the owner, Billy, would not accept our credit card and demanded we paid him cash or money order in full or our event would be cancelled. We told him that the contract explicitly states that a cc is an acceptable form of payment and that he could take. He said that he would take us to court and sue us if we didn't pay. We were under the notion that he was going to cancel our event bc we refused to give in to his demands but two days later he ran our credit card wo our knowledge and called our planner to let us know all is well & that we could have our wedding day. We never got our money back and we ended up not having our wedding there. I don't think any bride & groom who endured what we did would want to have their wedding there as well. We had to find a new venue at the last minute and rejigger our wedding day schedule because of Billy. Folks - there is something sketchy when a business owner demands you pay in cash when the contract doesn't state that. Please beware of this. I have all of our correspondences saved if anyone wants to see them.

"Originally posted 792010:Just wanted to warn Yelpers about this place. We made reservations in March for an October wedding party and were told today (July 6) that everyone's reservations have been cancelled. The bride-to-be was told that a higher-paying party had reserved that date and that, literally, ""That's life."" They have an F rating with the Better Business Bureau, now we all know why.Edit 9182012:I'd like to thank Dave for the sincere apology I've received here on Yelp, two years and nearly three months, after the fact.

"I'm planning a wedding in Pittsburgh from San Francisco. I've asked the owners for information 3 times by email and had my mother call them. The owner refuses to give any price information until you or a family comes to see the property in person. I'm a little offended at how the owner feels my time is just available to go look at his venue before I even know if the place is within my budget. It is difficult enough to plan a wedding from across the country to begin with, but when the owners of a venue won't even send you info, it makes it all the more difficult. The photos make the place look really gorgeous but the other reviews on here must ring true if the owner won't even show you the costs first!

"The Boggs Mansion (now called the Inn on the Mexican War Streets) was grand enough, and tastefully decorated.  We could have lived with the cold cookies, popcorn and cheap candies put out for snack; or even, the lack of basic room service. Perhaps we should have felt ""warned"" the first evening when we were escorted to our room and told that we could put out the ""Maid, please service the room"" sign, but that we shouldn't count on anything happening.  Perhaps we should have been ""warned"" when the innkeeper manically scribbled all over a map while ""explaining"" what to see and how to get around in that neighborhood.  No doubt, we should have been more alert to what we were being charged up front for our 5 night reservation, because the innkeeper wildly disclaimed ability to use a calculator and insisted on doing the sums by hand with a pencil and paper.  As a result, we were immediately overcharged by $111.66  from the amount we had agreed to in writing several months before.  All of this was not what we expected, and as trusting ""guests"" who wanted to have an enjoyable time, we ignored the ""issues"" and let the eccentricities slide that first night.  As others have written in their reviews, the breakfast is a self-serve affair which was your basic budget hotel big-box store fare, with the exception of some yogurt, hard-boiled eggs and a bowl of aging frozen mixed fruit.  All of this was counter indicated by anything we've experienced in Bed and Breakfast establishments in the past, but we were trying to have a good time and not make a fuss.  However, my husband and I both work from our computers when we are traveling, and I had specifically asked well in advance about wifi and internet connection before I made our reservation to stay for 5 nights at the Inn.  I had been assured that there was wifi and that it was free of charge. It says this in all the online ads for the hotel as well. Needless to say, we were taken aback the first night of our stay when it took us a long time to connect to the internet, and only when we figured out that we had to use a very old connection protocol.  When consulted, the innkeeper claimed he personally didn't have much use for the internet and was fairly indifferent to our requests for a decent internet connection.  On the second night, when we returned to our unserviced room, we discovered that there was no internet connection at all.  I went in search of Karl, the innkeeper, to help us, but he was nowhere to be found.  After struggling with the problem for quite a while, we gave up on trying to get any business done via internet. The next morning, while I was fetching our coffee and pastries from the breakfast area, Karl appeared.  I very politely told him the situation with the internet and asked if he would call the internet service provider to find out why there was no internet service to the house.  At first, Karl simply seemed indifferent and told me that our room could always get internet.  About two minutes later, out of the clear blue, he was screaming at me from the stair landing that I ""didn't know what it's like to work for a living because you've led a privileged life, could do anything you want, and had never worked a day in your life.""  I stood in shock with the creamer in my hand over the Folgers!  Never in my life have I encountered such outrageous, presumptive insults; and certainly not from the host of a hotel to whom I'd paid good money to provide reasonable services and a comfortable time.  My husband witnessed this scene from the top of the stairs.  When I returned, quit shaken, to our room, we discussed the situation and agreed that we should leave.  After packing our traveling gear, my husband went in search of the innkeeper to explain that we would be leaving due to his intolerable behavior, and to request a refund for the three nights remaining.  After several minutes of calling all over the house for him, Karl finally crept out of a downstairs door.  My husband made his requests, and within seconds we both witnessed him fly into an insane rage once again, screaming nonsense which included insults of both of us and our home state, slamming doors multiple times, and then reopening the doors in order to follow us around while screaming at us to get out.  He only barely managed to come up with a refund slip, although it was for the wrong amount and was not processed correctly because of the faulty internet connection and because of his unwillingness to use a calculator for doing sums.  This whole scene and situation wasted many hours of a day of our long-anticipated vacation in Pittsburgh, but we were both happy to get away from so much insult and outrage.  We certainly would never recommend that anyone stay at the Inn on the Mexican War Streets.

"February-2013 - Just to respond to Jeff S's comments and claims: (1) At no time were we told that the internet was out and would stay out just because the other innkeeper was not there to fix it.  We WERE told, repeatedly, that the connection in our assigned room always worked, and that we were free to try other rooms.  It didn't work at all, anywhere in the Inn, the 2nd night.  (2) We were never offered assistance in finding another hotel in the area.  When we left the Inn, we had to go to McDonald's to get an internet connection in order to research other hotel possibilities for the 3 nights we were displaced. (3) The second night, we were the ONLY guests in the Inn, so there was no one else there to be ""understanding.""  We were only informed about the death in Karl's family as he was demanding that we leave while screaming at us about being ""privileged"" and from California.   (4) We were charged $111.66 too much up front for the 5 nights when we arrived for our stay at the Inn.  To date, we are still waiting for that amount to be refunded.  It is certainly NOT TRUE that we received a refund for the nights we stayed, although we feel that kind of refund would be entirely appropriate considering the harsh treatment and lack of services.  We are sorry that the innkeepers see this as ""an inconvenience.""  We see it as a very ugly and disturbing incident that ruined many hours of our time and cast a pall over the rest of our vacation.

"My friends & I all purchased Groupons  for the Pittsburgh Improv on or around March 22nd, 2012. At that time, only a few big name comedians were listed on the Improv's website as Special Events. You can use the Groupon on anything that isn't a Special Event. That seemd reasonable. The day the Groupons were purchased, my friend Katrina called & reserved two tickets to Jim Jeffries for 330 at 10pm. They allowed her to use her Groupon & gave her a confirmation code & everything! Shortly after, they changed many of the comedians on their website, including Jim Jeffries, to Special Events. When I called I was told I could not use my Groupon. The same thing happened to many of my friends. It's a classic bait & switch. These comedians were NOT Special Events until after the Groupon came out. In addition, other restrictions, such not being able to use the Groupons on Saturdays & having to use the additional four vouchers for one show, were NOT listed under the restrictions when the Groupon was for sale. So tonight, my friends & I had pretty much resolved ourselves to the fact that we were not going to the Improv because they wouldn't allow us to use our Groupons. But I walked over to the Will Call window with my friend Katrina so she could at least get her tickets. Big surprise - she was told they didn't have her reservation or her name in their computers! They wouldn't give her the tickets. It's an absolute joke of a deal. How is everyone going to use their Groupons by Sept. if all of the shows are Special Events now In addition, no one at the Improv answers the phones or responds to emails. My friends & I (about 10 of us total) are all getting refunds through Groupon andor our credit card companies & we are all reporting the Improv to the Better Business Bureau, etc. The Pittsburgh Improv is extremely shady & does not care about their customers.

"It isn't often that my wife and I get to go out, but we had tickets to see the WONDERFUL Lisa Landry and figured since we were going to the Improv, we may as well eat there too. I should have gotten on here and read the reviews before making that decision. We had what seems to be a typical experience at the improv. We were handed a paper menu with 4 items on it when we walked in the door. There was no other menu at the table and our waitress didn't offer us one either. She wanted our order, but as we were looking around the place, we realized that most of those around us were eating items that not on the menu provided to us. When asked about another menu, our waitress told us if we give her our drink order, she'll see what she can do. The table next to us handed over their menus so we had something to work with. Our drinks came, we finally put our orders in...and that was the last time we saw our waitress for almost a full 30 minutes. When she finally came back, all she wanted was to know if we wanted a 2nd round of drinks. After 30 minutes I was finally going to get a second beer! ""What about our food"", we asked. ""Oh"", was her answer. Now, according to the menu, dinner came with a side salad, a complimentary glass of champagne, and a chocolate mousse dessert. That's all good and fine. After a couple of minutes, someone, not our waitress, finally brought out our meals. When we asked him about our salads, his reply was ""do you want me to take your food back"". Really!! ""Do you want me to take your food back"" After almost 45 minutes at this point, we had received 1 round of drinks and had seen our waitress only twice and had just received our food. No, I don't want you to take our food back! Halfway through eating our meals, which were by this time cold, our waitress finally came back with our second beers. She asked us how everything was. We asked about our salads. She said she was told we didn't want them. REALLY!! Is this a joke Is it somehow part of the comedy routine that was going on Sadly, no. The service didn't get any better. The food was lousy. Thankfully the standup was great. Lisa, Lisa and Matt all put on a hilarious show. Will I ever go back Don't know. It took us an hour and a half to drive the 16 miles to get there, thanks to traffic. I do know that if we do it again, we will leave the house much earlier and eat somewhere else. The two drink minimum works at the improv because you will not get your waitress to your table more than that to order more drinks. In case you're interested, I am a chef who has been in the service industry for more than 30 years and worked every position possible in restaurants and bars. So, yes, I do have a preconceived notion as to how service and food should be. Even on Valentine's Day.

"What a rip off. Went as part of the madison comedy festival to see Margaret Cho.  Paid extra for vip tix and still had to wait in line. When seated, told we had to sit back to front, so I would be unable to talk or sit next to my friend. When we moved to sit side by side we were told we could not. We were then moved out of vip seating even though I paid extra. And was told I was the only person to have a problem sitting as I was told. Think that you buy a ticket to a show you're done Wrong! You still have to comply with a 2 drink minimum! Will avoid this place at all costs in the future! The actual show went great, just the management needs work.

"I paid a visit to the Comedy Spot a few weeks ago on the Saturday night of my friend Gabi's bachelorette weekend (see review below).  I'm with Gabs as I also thought this would be the perfect activity post-dinner for our group. I think we are all seriously mistaken. I also agree with Gabi that it was a bit of a buzz kill...literally. For the most part, the comedians who performed sucked expect for one girl duo called Carlie and Doni. The ROCKED! So funny!!!By the way, the drinks were disgusting and we got yelled at for being to loud, it was as cold as a meat locker inside and once again except for Carlie and Doni the comedians ABSOLUTELY SUCKED!!!I enjoyed Carlie and Doni's performance they sang a few off songs about funny life expereinces like a bikini waxing. Warning, do your homework before stepping inside. Make sur eyou know the comedians on the line up and try to sneak in your own drinks. :)

"WOW, was I disappointed.  We paid over the net and they had no listing when we arrived.  Got a table, ordered drinks only to be told we had to move because they had a party of 15.  several other couples were treated just as we were.  We got there 50 minutes early to get a good table. Then we had to  move.  Try watching a stand up act that you need to stand up to see it.  The table service was good.  First  3 acts was like high school entertainment.  The pics you see here are nothing like the place.  One room packed so tight you could not move. Classic case of squeeze the cash out of you.  Never again.  This is one of the most memorable birthdays I've spent.  Scottsdale should wake up.  Too much nice entertainment around for your dollars than this place.  Totally disappointed.  When we called before the show to confirm everything is set it turns out there is not a live person to be found.  Leave a message. The person at the door managing  Turns out he is one of the acts.  Can't believe they stay in business.  Had we been treated with repect it may have been an ok night.  My cash will be spent in other parts of Phoenix from now on.On a positive note the Marriot a few blocks away was fantastic!

"This is a very dumpy club. Some closets, the bar area and the men's room might be bigger. I would call it intimate, but it has no intimacy, it is like an afterthought. They have one bathroom with one toilet each for men and women - that must be a code violation. It was like seeing a show in your buddies garage and a bad show at that. On this night, I donated 10 bucks to watch Bob Howard and Friends, which was actually some old lawyer moonlighting as a comedian. The rest of Bob's friends were old and older and I did not manage to laugh once, except at the dude who was wearing a fishing hat that Bob Newhart probably owned. That same moron would not accept my two buck off coupon at the door claiming it was a special night. A bunch of amateur comedians at a 6pm show does not sound too special to me. Out of respect for a date, I had to wait until after the show to heckle this guy. His whole 15 minute act was asking the front row of people what they did and making fun of them, an act of a child. I felt much better when I heckled him in the hallway, asking him if he knew any jokes and he had no response. The two drink minimum is not mentioned until you sit in your seat and on this night, the waitress overcharged me for a beer on special. She lost out on a tip. Poor staff, poor comedy, poor venue - go to a real comedy club, unless you are a good heckler because you might be star of the show at that point.

"READ THE FAQ section!!!!   It contains crucial information that if you don't have, you could just lose out on the money you paid for tickets.No idea how there aren't more terrible reviews based upon the issue I had as well as the terrible...no...LACK OF customer service.Here's what happened to me. I know it's long, but it explains exactly the type of customer service and the type of shady business this place is:A buddy of mine was opening for some lady I've never heard of. I didn't care about the main act, but figured for $12 a ticket, I could sit through whatever came after his opening act, rightBought tickets the week before so I would be sure to have a ticket for the 8 pm show. This meant an additional $1 per ticket but I figured that was worth it to guarantee a seat. Day of, I had to work until 4 and again at 8 am, so I decided 8 pm would be better than 10. Ended up at work late, got home, showered, go ready, and hauled ass to the club which was about 30 minutes away. Got there at about 7:57 but the parking lot was full so we drove to a nearby parking area and walked over. As we were walking a couple was walking away and said kind of angrily, ""They're all sold out for this show!"" My boyfriend said, ""Thanks, but she already bought tickets."" The woman replied, ""Yeah...so did we!""Confused, we approached the doorman, printed receiptticket in hand. He informed us that they were sold out... ME: Riiiiiight...but we have tickets! DOORMAN: Sorry. You can either come back for the 10 pm show or email them for a refund.Meanwhile, the woman who warned us and her date came back over to ask more questions. We were all very confused about how buying tickets to a show doesn't mean that you have seats at that show. The doorman explained with the manager or owner or whoever the chubby old guy is, standing right there, that they recommend that you come a half hour before the show and get in line. Anyone in the front of the line with tickets at that time will get in, then they'll sell any remaining tickets to people in line who didn't pre-purchase tickets.So...there is really NO point in purchasing tickets before showing up because it makes no difference as to whether you get into the show. If people with no tickets show up before you and buy your seats, you're just out the money.Because I had to work the next morning, I opted not to attend the 10 pm show. I verified with the doorman that I could email for a refund, and he said yes. I told him the info regarding this reselling already purchased tickets should be on the receipt or should be made known to you. He informed me that ""it's on the website"".On the way home, my boyfriend got on the website and tried to find it. He eventually did...15 minutes later buried in the FAQs! I think that's BS. Why would I read all the FAQs if I didn't have any reason to A warning that they can sell your tickets to someone who shows up at the door before you should be more obvious and should be volunteered to you before you agree to purchase anything.In the FAQ section we also found the warning that sales are final and no refunds will be given at any time. Since the doorman had CLEARLY told us multiple times that we could email for a refund, I wasn't sure what to believe at this point. So...I called the club phone number. I figured if that were true, maybe we should turn back and try and make the 10 pm show. I got their voicemail and just left my name and number and requested a call back. I didn't even say why I was calling and they still never called back. Not that night. Not the next day. Not Monday morning. Not EVER. The next day I emailed the club for my refund just as the door guy said. Again...no response whatsoever. My next step was filing a complaint with PayPal who immediately escalated it. Eventually they informed me that they gave the club so many days (I believe it was...10 days maybe) to respond to several requests by PayPal to address my issue. They never responded (shocker!) so PayPal refunded my money. Luckily I was protected by PayPal and would've been protected by my credit card company as well. However, if it hadn't been for that, I would have been out $26 for a show I never saw. I don't know if most people read the FAQ section for every restaurant, venue, theater, stadium, etc... they attend but I don't. I probably will now, but I still think it's shady. When you buy tickets to a movie, baseball game, concert, etc...those tickets are yours  whether you show up early, on time or even late. I didn't know there was any place that buying tickets didn't guarantee you a seat.

"Gotta love thier overpriced drinks they FORCE you to purchase. 2 DRINK minimum...really! I dont drink so I was forced to purchase water. I spend money on the tickets yet I am forced to purchase 2 waters and on top of that they automatically add in 18% tip for a waiter that took forever to even bring me my WATER. I think not! And they are now owned by stand up live...so I guess I will be avoiding both places until they get their ""act"" together

"TERRIBLE SERVICE!!! Only reason they got 1 star is because I cant go lower....My sister and I came to the Tempe improv for the first time sense its remodel. We came to see Ralphie May on a Wednesday night. The whole area was packed full of guest. We chose to sit on the end of the half booth half table. Many servers would come by and ask if we had more in our party so they could sit another couple in the seats, we did not, however every time they would put a couple in those seats the server would suggest they move because it was right in the walk way and people would be stepping on them the while time, or the people would ask to be moved because of the same reason. Right before the show began we had a couple that sat in front of us, only because they were the last seats available. We ordered our drinks and food at the same time, it took the server a bit to come over but we were fine just hanging out. Once we ordered, after he tried up-selling absolutely everything, we waited, and waited, and waited. We watched three tables who ordered after us get their food and drinks before we even got our drinks. The manager must have noticed my frustration written all over my face because he came over and asked if we had ordered. I said ""yes we did, about a half hour ago"". He apologized and we had our drinks about 10 minutes later. During the waiting of our food a server with a full tray of beverages spilled them all on the couple behind us. The customers were good sports and let it go. The ice tea my sister ordered tasted absolutely terrible, however it didn't much matter because I spilled it on her anyway. We tried maintaining the mess while servers walked by and and saw the mess yet did nothing. I finally got up and interrupted a server entering items into a register and said we have had a spill I need napkins. She didn't even look at me and said their are napkins right there. They were the small cocktail napkins your drink goes on..... so i took the whole stack, that got her attention! We cleaned up the mess ourselves and still waited on our food. The HORRIBLE food finally came out, and then the lights shut off for the show to start. I would say it is very difficult to eat in the dark but after a few bites I was done. The show started late so it went into the evening later then planned. I have heard Ralphie doesn't always stop when he is supposed to (which can be great) but it was time for us to get out of there. We asked our server for our check and he said he couldn't check us out in there that we had to step into the lobby area. It didn't make any sense but walked away without more explanation. I tried to explain to my sister what he said but she was just as confused as I. We went ahead and got up and went into the lobby, where there was not where for us to pay at all. The server finally came out and asked where we were going, I told him I said we needed our check so we could leave. He brought us the check, wrong, over $35 of the bill was not ours. I gave him my card and it took him forever but luckily got it fixed and as far as I know didn't charge me incorrect. By far this has been the worst experience I have had at the Tempe improv. May the remodle wasnt the best idea.....

"It's never fair to judge a club by the comedians on a Wednesday night..... too bad, it would have earned a better rating because the actual show was great. Arrived with 4 friends and picked up our tickets, no issues. We were seated right up front and our original server quickly greeted us, brought us menus and told us about the special drinks for the evening; one of which was a mojito. One of my friends ordered the mojito and about 5 min later our server returned to tell us that they were out of mint. She was a good sport and just ordered something else but you would think that the servers would have been informed if one of the specials was unavailable. My white wine was served warm, gross. All of us ordered food. 2 of us got the Buffalo Chicken Sliders, one of us requested no blue cheese. After our food came I thought they had mistakenly brought both orders plain so I asked for a side of ranch. I later found a small drop of blue cheese on mine even though it wasn't enough to be noticed. Around this time, our original awesome server came over to tell us that he was cut for the night and introduce us to server 2 who quickly wanted to know what our second drink choice would be. One of my friends asked if food doesn't count as one of the items as she was the one driving.... No it doesn't which to me, it a horrible policy, especially if that policy is not made known. When the check came, I noticed that I had been charged $1.50 for ranch. I wouldn't have needed the ranch if my food was presented as it was advertised. The only thing we ordered that was actually good was the $8 side of sweet potato fries. I'm sure I'll be back because I enjoy comedy but next time, it will be 2 whatever-is-cheapest drinks and we'll go out to dinner elsewhere.

"Here's a novel idea: Open a comedy club with food that doesn't come from the freezer section of Costco.  Anyone  Anyone  Bueller  I had high hopes for the ""new and improved"" Tempe Improv.  I love love love stand-up comedy but always found it hard to justify what is bound to be a rather expensive evening.  Unfortunately, the new policies have made it that much harder.  They automatically add an 18% gratuity to EVERY CHECK.  Had our service not been terrible, I wouldn't have minded this nearly as much.  Our waitress was nice but it took absolutely forever to get anything.  We asked for water when we were seated (which was 45 minutes before the start time of the show) and didn't actually receive water until halfway through the show.  Long before this though, two in our party physically walked up to the bar and brought back waters for the table.  They've changed the ""two item minimum"" to a ""two drink minimum"" thus making the entire experience even rape-ier.  The menu looks very much the same as the old menu.  The food quality is, overall, poor.  My husband's quesadilla was TINY.  It looked like a child's plate.  My buffalo chicken salad was mostly lettuce and the chicken had possibly been hot the day before.  It had clearly been around a while.  It wasn't even warm and was tough to cut.  The pretzel appetizer was okay but I am spoiled for pretzels thanks to Claim Jumper and Arrogant Butcher.  These were slightly better than the Super Pretzels you bake at home. The drink situation is highway robbery, prison sex and food poisoning all at the same time.  My friend and I ordered standard cosmos.  They arrived and my glass was nowhere near full and it tasted like cherry koolaid.  They were so bad we asked to send them back and get something else.  The waitress accommodated us (which was nice) and the drinks sat on our table.  Upon reviewing the check, she did take off the cosmo but I noticed that it was $11 plus a $2 upgrade for SMIRNOFF.  Smirnoff.  Are you kidding  She even asked us if we wanted to upgrade vodka and we said no.  Smirnoff being an upgrade still boggles my mind.  What do you get without an upgrade  Harry's Toilet Vodka  We all tried each other's drinks and everything was weak and watered down.  The one thing they've done right is rearrange the club so there is less seating and you are not accidentally creating a child with your neighbor.  Admittedly, it was nice not to be so crammed in.  Despite these issues, we enjoyed the comic immensely (we saw Michael McDonald).  As I said earlier, I love stand-up but the current practices at the Improv are going to make it very difficult for me to come back.

"I recently visited the Tempe Improv a couple of weeks ago to see Michael McDonald.  I was looking forward to seeing the changes made to the ""new"" Improv, but was incredibly disappointed, mostly with the service.I truly enjoy getting out to a comedy show.  There's nothing more entertaining than a night out with friends laughing.  Makes for an amazing time.  I absolutely loved Michael McDonald and his opening act.  The comedy that night was fantastic....but that was where it ended.  It started with our server, who didn't even bring us water until at least halfway through the show.  A friend and I had to go up to the bar ourselves in order to get water for our table of 6.  I understand that it's hectic with all the tables being sat practically at once, but an establishment like this should be prepared and expect that sort of thing.  It is NOT ok to keep your paying customers waiting extensive amounts of time for anything, especially water.  As part of your 2 drink requirement, I would HIGHLY recommend that you get either beer or wine.  You'll get the most for your money from either of those options.  Their mixed drinks are not even worth mentioning.  A friend and I ordered a cosmo.  How can you go wrong with a cosmo, right  Well....they successfully did.  It tasted like punch, and not even good punch, with absolutely NO alcohol.  I had asked our server how much the cosmo was, because there were no prices on the menu, and she had told me they were $11.   I was a little shocked to see a tiny martini glass not even full come out, knowing that I was going to have to pay $11 for this.  She had also asked if I wanted to upgrade, which I declined.  I noticed on the check that there was an extra $2 charge for an upgrade to Smirnoff.  1) How is Smirnoff an upgrade 2) I said I didn't want an upgrade and 3) The fact that you're charging that ridiculous amount for a drink that didn't taste good and had no trace of alcohol in it is absolutely absurd.  The only good thing our server did was allow us to trade our drinks and order something new.  I ordered a long island, which was ok, but nothing close to what a long island should taste like.  It was a whole lot better than the ridiculous attempt at a Cosmo though.  I realize that these sort of outings are already going to be overpriced, but I don't expect to get such poor service.  Out of my group of 6, there was really only 1 meal that was enjoyed, which were the nachos.  Everything else was maybe adequate at the best.  I don't expect gourmet food at the improve, but I expect edible and decent food, since I am paying the overly priced rates.  The final straw that threw me overboard was the fact that EACH check was automatically charged 18% gratuity.  I used to be a server, so I normally tip about 20% for good service.  We didn't receive anything close to good service, and to be forced to pay 18% in GRATUITY (which means it should be left up to me on how much I WANT to give), is ridiculous.  The good servers at this establishment are missing out on at extra 2% and the customers are being ripped off for being required to tip a bad server way too much.  My experience at the ""NEW"" Tempe Improv was definitely less than desirable.  Like I said before, the comedy was the only good factor.  It makes it hard to want to go back when there are so many other options in town.  I will definitely have to rethink my decision to return, and will do only for a comedian worthwhile.  If I do return, I will be eating dinner somewhere else and only be ordering the required 2 drink minimum.

"I had been here a couple years ago and it was a pretty good experience but then I came here again recently for a Miranda Sings concert and I was very disappointed. Can you say RIP OFF The tickets were reasonably priced ($20) but then there was a ""two drink minimum"" rule. I wasn't thirsty do I opted for the cheapest option- I ordered a lemonade, which was super nasty. So I sent it back and ordered a sprite instead- also very nasty. I don't know how they managed to make their simple fountain drinks taste so bad. Anyway, the next time I saw my waitress it was to bring me my check, which was $13!! I had only drank a couple sips of each of my drinks and that's what they charged. So stupid- that's almost the price that I paid for my ticket itself. Anyway, Tempe improv should pull out of the food and beverage thing all together and just make stadium-style seating so that everybody can watch the performances a lot easier and not be ripped off and forced to buy gross drinks.

"We saw the show with Aidy Bryant and Tim Robinson tonight. The show was great and wasn't the problem at all. Let me start by saying that I work in customer service, so I know what good customer service looks like and what bad customer service looks like. Tonight we received AWFUL service from a server. We were under the impression that the 2 drink minimum requirement could include beer and soft drinks. Seeing as how we had already paid about $50 to see the show, and it is ridiculous to pay over $10 for one cocktail, we figured going the cheaper route would be the way to go. Once we ordered a coke and  Blue Moon, the server shut us down and gave us the most attitude I have ever received from a server. She didn't make eye contact with us, she told me the beers she had like it was some kind of chore and she had better places to be. She also passed us by several times, while we had empty drinks on the table, helped the customers around us, and pretended like we didn't exist. Yes, we ordered the cheapest drinks we could, but the gratuity was included and our bill STILL came out to $30 for only 3 beers and a soda. As outrageous as that is alone, I still can't believe the service we received. We were paying customers and deserved to be treated as such. What if I was in AA and ordered a soda because I couldn't drink alcohol That is unacceptable service and we will not be coming back to this establishment.

"The Improv previously offered a two ""item"" minimum.  Now it is a two ""drink"" minimum.  I guess they figure people will eat anyway so we'll just get more money out of them by making them get two drinks to go with the food.  Their drinks are so overpriced, even for a comedy club.  $5.75 for an iced tea is absurd.  Their specialty mixed drinks are $14.95 and are in an approximately 13 oz. hurricane glass that is more ice and mix than alcohol.  We were seated to the right of the stage and could not hear the show until after the fourth attempt of letting somebody know our entire table was unable to hear the show (party of 7).  The group next to us were taking pictures (even though it's not allowed) and talking the entire time.  We asked them to keep it down.  They got confrontational.  The club did not ask them to keep it down or ask them to leave.  Our group spent nearly five hundred dollars on the evening (with tickets) and had a very unpleasant experience.  None of us will be returning.

"Here's my problem with this club; they seem to have an incompetent group of teenagers running this place. The girls at will call seem very confused. The staff inside is aloof. I went there with a group of friends to see Chris Delia. 4 tickets and only 3 of us were there as we were waiting on the 4th to arrive. The girl at the door told us we would have to wait for our 4th person to show up for our entire party to be seated. Then she proceeded to make jokes that were completely lost on us. She giggled and cackled the whole time, almost seeming as though she was directly making fun of our situation, which we didn't find funny since we arrived early for good seats. We waited for a couple minutes and were greeted by a server who showed us to our table, even though our 4th was still not there, she informed us it was fine and we could wait inside at our table for her. Which was cool. I don't understand why that's such a big deal anyway. The servers there deserve to be paid more. They hustle and are very friendly and efficient. This club needs to find a new staff to handle the tickets. One of my least favorite comedy clubs for this reason. Once the Laugh Factory opens in Scottsdale, I'll take my business there. Hopefully they'll employ people who actually know what they're doing.

"This show may have been funny four years ago, which is when my husband first saw it and why he recommended we see it on our recent Vegas trip. But the show must have changed drastically - first off, it's no longer improv, but just rehearsed bad skits (think today's SNL skits...now think ten times worse than that). The actors are good, but the script is just not funny at all. I think the only people that laughed during the performance were a group of college kids that looked drunkhigh and guffawed at anything. We were not the only disappointed faces in the room, and we heard a guy exit and tell some people in line for the next showing that they shouldn't waste their time and just eat the cost of tickets and go gamble. We paid full price for these tickets so we were even more disappointed. Avoid this show at all costs!

"This show was definitely NOT what we are used to for comedy...the reason...comedy was absent....If you are looking for stand-up comedy, improvisational or not, this is not the place. This is a comedy troupe (being generous on the word comedy here...). There are no tables, just rows of chairs...but that is because there is no drink service. This is more geared to the 12 - 20 crowd, with sodas and candy bars for sale, and simply some place to hang out on a Saturday night...And this was the ""late"" show... Really wish we could get back that 90 minutes of life...but it is gone forever... The place was full (largely 12 - 25 crowd. So, someone likes it...but we will not be back.

"We used a Groupon on a Saturday night.  There was no problem redeeming the Groupon for two VIP tickets.  A line began forming at 9:15pm.  At 9:45pm, they took VIP ticket holders out of the line and escorted us upstairs to the venue.There were no tables for our drinks and the chairs were very uncomfortable.  Behind the make-shift stage were windows overlooking the Strip.  The flashing light coming from giant signage was very distracting.  All three performers were terribly unfunny.  They all seemed to be 'phoning it in' and didn't really seem to be interested in making us laugh.  At times, the Bellagio fountains (which we could easily see behind the performers) were more interesting than the comedians.The show started at 10:20 and ended at 11:20.  Exactly one hour.  The whole event was very amateurish.  We will not be back and will not recommend the show to our friends.

"Small venue and the comics were not funny. The last 2 comedy clubs I've done in Vegas have been very disappointing, the other being The Improv. The best time at one of these I ever had was at The Comedy Stop at the Trop, but that one is no more. It's really a good thing my friend got us all in for free on a locals ticket. Otherwise, I would have been even more disappointed.If you're not careful, you will spill your drinks as the only place they had for them was a cup holder on the back of the chair in front of you. This is another Vegas venue where they just make you feel like herded cattle.I have decided after this dismal display, that I will no longer be doing comedy clubs unless they have a nationally known headliner and I know I'm going to laugh so hard that I can't laugh anymore. I can get just as many good laughs from a bad comedy movie.

"My husband and I decided to check this out, and purchased discount tickets on the strip.  Even at half off, I feel like we threw our money away!  The comedians were amateur at best, and this includes the headliner.  Jokes were not only crude, but nasty and several people walked out during the show. The drinks were overpriced and the ""all you can drink"" option for $25 was not a good deal.  Cheap wine, well drinks and domestic beer.  My advice Save your money and buy tickets to a genuine comedy act.

"Why ask people to bring their ""VIP"" tickets at 8:15pm if you're not going to let anyone in until after 9pmLA Comedy club wasn't on the directory so we had to ask several employees where the club was. We purchased groupons that said to bring your VIP ticket between 8:15-9:00. We arrived at 8:20 and there were no employees anywhere and the club was closed. There was a make shift line of random customers with the same confusion. We left and came back at 8:45. There at least was now an employee who told us that it didn't open for another 20 minutes. We went to go lean against the wall to wait and found out if we hadn't left we would have been first in line as that was where the line started. About 7 people had filled in so we weren't that far back but I the employee did her job with information we could have been first.The groupon said front row, we asked to be sat in the front row - we were sat two rows back - even though there were no people in the front row yet - when that row was occupied, it was because they were seated well after we were. The row we were in did not have tables or anything to lean on - only every other row had tables. Definitely not VIP seats.I would not recommend this cluster-F of a ""comedy club"" nor will I come back.**********UPDATE***********I left the original review during the 45 minute wait for the show to start. After the show, I was accosted by the host who sat me. He apologized for not hearing me ask for the front row. Then asked me to prove to him that groupon listed front row seating because it didn't say it anywhere on the paper. He did this IN FRONT OF EVERYONE LEAVING - I was horrified. It was like he had zero customer service experience ever. So I pulled up the groupon page on my phone (something he could have done himself after reading my review) and showed him. He physically took my phone out of my hands to show it to the owner - again like he couldn't just pull up the page himself later. The owner looked like he couldn't care less. The host had told me he wanted to resolve the issue. I guess in his mind it was resolved - now that I proved I wasn't lying. And sent me on my way with an apology. If I could give a zero star review I would. Now instead of never going back, I'm going to tell EVERYONE about my shitty experience and make sure no-one else has to waste their money on LA Comedy Club!

"I paid for VIP seating for the show.  What a waste of money!  There was no distinction between general seating and VIP seating.  Some people in front of us has tables, but we did not.  At the least, we should have had a table on which to set our drinks.  The show was fine, but do not waste your money to upgrade to VIP.  I complained the next day to the box office sales booth at Bally's, but they could have cared less.

"Oh puh-leaze!  The good reviews must be written about excellent headliners or by shills.  Got supposedly ""free"" tickets that cost the three of us $40.  They included one watered down drink each.  Yes, even my bottled water (that is clearly labeled $4) cost $10.50, plus a $2.50 upcharge, plus tax, plus whatever else it took to get to the $40.  The MC was horrible, and I never heard so many genitalia jokes in a 60 minute period before from three different comics.  If you go, take lots of money and buy lots of drinks because the only people laughing were drunk, drunk, drunk.  The venue is very mediocre and, as might be expected in Vegas, you have to walk through the casino to get to it.  Showtickets4locals sure was a rip off on this occasion.  Never used them before and never will again.

"Ay, yay, yay.  I know why you're reading this review.  Like me, you didn't score tickets for a ""good"" show and are thinking about spending $25 so the night isn't wasted.

Entertainer isn't the right word for this 4th class hack.People, please, listen to me.  I promise I will not steer you wrong.This is the worst performer I have ever had the displeasure of seeing.  He STINKS!  Not funny, not talented.  It was the most miserable 45 minutes I'd ever spent.  To include a divorce, a motorcycle accident and a root canal.Three friends and I agonized over leaving in the middle of the show but in the end just had to.  His ""entertainment"" bordered on embarrassing!  Like an untalented William Hung, GB can't sing, can't dance, can't tell jokes.All of his impersonations sound like the same guy--HIM.  Try watching Gordie Brown do Michael Jackson.  It was painfully like Gordie Brown doing Gordie Brown.It's too bad, too.  He seems like a nice guy.  He's just not talented AT ALL.Do yourselves a favor and steer clear of this losing show.

"Without a doubt, the absolute worst Vegas showcomedian I have ever witnessed!  Went to the show hearing that he is so fantastic like many of these reviews, but oh what a surprise. Seriously, not sure how he is employed...Within the first 3- 5minutes of the show, I wasn't sure if his crappy impressions were a real attempt at humor or a bad Andy Kauffman like impression put-on.  After 5 minutes it didn't get better and I was torn between being  embarrassed for him or completely ticked that I actually paid to see the performance.  His shiny white teeth contrasted nicely with his dark shirt with a hole in the armpit...nice touch Gordy. Not funny... best joke of the night was him jokingly tellingthanking the weekend audience (90% over 50) that it was his 3162 consecutive sellout to a clearly at best half empty room.  He blamed it on a fictitious foreign tour bus driver that must have mistakenly taken the rest of the crowd to the wrong hotel...the silver nugget instead of the golden nugget (rim-shot here). Oh God help me!I am being serious here when I write all this...I've heard better song impressions at the local karaoke bar and better joke telling in a 5th grade talent show... really!  Not joking.  As For being current... Jokes about Tatoo from fantasy island...really  The show has been off the air for 28 years and the actor who played ""tatoo"" has been dead for 19 years.  Jokes about Sammy Davis with 1 eye...I get it he sees with one eye not 2.  Sammy had a fake eye so he looks funny.  Then we get into impressions from the blockbuster film we all know and love on golden pond...oh wait that was 31 years ago.  When do we get to see Gordy do ""the Fonz"" AAAAAAEEEEE!I got up and left to take a leak during the set with hopes that he would try to embarrass me and ask where I was going.  Funny thing is I wanted him too as I was ready with the comment have you seen your show... the only thing worse than the act is the overdone photoshop work on his marquee out front.  Pretty scary when you are an introvert and want take on a seasoned comedian, but nothing about his act was witty, fun, or entertaining. I was with a big group, and so I did come back for more.Closest edgy part is when he did a crappy deep mexican accent (could have been the Frito Bandito as far as I could tell) claiming it was Antonio Banderes (of course he needed to tell you who he was doing in his accent first...and how relevant is Antonio these days anyway)  Mentioned Antonio did the animated movie puss and boots as it was his 2 favorite things boots and ... pause...(rimshot here).  Is that funny to you and am I missing somethingIf you are 65-100, maybe this thing is for you, but for me (45) this was a impressioncomedy suck fest at its finest. I wouldn't go again for free even if they served beer and washed my car in the parking garage...really.  Honestly Gordy, contact me and I'll be glad to get my refund!  You seem like a nice man but I left the show feeling like I lost an hour+ of my life and $100 over nothing more than a crappy PT Barnum sideshow.  A sucker is born every minute and I left feeling like one!  Person with me walked out and said they needed a drink to recover from the awful performance. We both left feeling 100% ripped off, not in a happy mood.My advice, look up his act online on youtube and if that works for you, enjoy, if not, be warned.  Best part of the night was the Golden Nugget casino that was surprisingly very nice inside for an old-town vegas casino.

"First of all, can the Gordie's picture be a little more updated please You have seen it on fliers, billboard, and in magazines. And then you go see the show and you wonder if you're in the right theater. I mean the guy doesn't even look anything like in the ads.Anyways, now the review about the show. I went to the show with my sister, and we were probably the youngest ones there, except for the 21st birthday girl who got a b-day shout out in middle of the show. So from there on I knew we are going to hear bunch of corny and out dated jokes. He was impersonating a bunch of older singers and bands and all of sudden, Eminem comes out of no where. I was laughing, only because it was so ridiculous. And then George W Bush jokes start to surface throughout half of the show. I mean really Enough with the Bush jokes already. We get it, other comedians have all used the same punch lines and ridicules, lets just move on.In the end, I really wanted to leave early, but we were sitting in the front and I feel really bad walking out of the show. Gordie has a awesome and powerful voice. Very charismatic on the stage. But his jokes and impersonations are just dull and out of date. I cannot connect with the guy but I do see a lot of baby boomers where laughing their asses off. The show is not for me.

"Absolute worst show in Las Vegas...  and I am a very lenient guy.  My wife and I are early 30's, Las Vegas residents, and we average 2-3 shows a week.1)  His humor is awful, simply awful.  My wife and I kept looking at each other like ""why are people laughing"".  We had seats 4 rows from the very back, the number of people ""sneaking out"" (aka walking out) was unbelievable, never seen such an exodus from a show.2)  He rewrites song lyrics, with ""toilet humor for Republicans"" (as my lovely wife put it).  Somehow, bashing gays, blacks, and pot smokers got the ABSOLUTE most laughs.  We were in the back, we saw you people giving him a standing ovation!!3)  You have to be drunk and on vacation, as we saw most people coming in with sunburns and cocktails.4)  And as some have already pointed out, his picture must be from the 80's, because he looks older than my parents.Save your money for anything else!  Now that's advice from a local!  I was literally inspired to create a Yelp account after HIS shenanigans.

"My wife and I caught this show at the Golden Nugget and had heard good things about him in the media, so we were pretty excited to see him. 3 minutes into the show, we were staring at each other in disbelief. Absolutely the corniest sense of humor I've ever had the misfortune of seeing on a stage. His impressions are often dated and usually inaccurate. If he hadn't announced some of them prior to performing them, I would have been at a loss for who he was mimicking. A half hour into the show, we were waiting for him to turn his back on the crowd for a moment so we could run out of the theater and put an end to our suffering. I do acknowledge that some people in the audience seemed to be enjoying themselves, but I have no idea who his audience is. Maybe people who thought ""Mama's Family"" was the funniest show ever. I've heard people compare him to Danny Gans, but as far as I'm concerned, there's no comparison. Gans was much more entertaining, his impressions were much more spot-on, and although I didn't find him the funniest guy in the world, he was Richard Pryor compared to Mr. Brown. I would certainly recommend a trip to Frank Caliendo's show if you're looking for an impressionist. If you find yourself at the Golden Nugget, go stare at their aquarium rather than watch this show...it's more entertaining and they have a pufferfish that does a better Nicholson than Brown does.

"Have been going to the Pennsylvania Macaroni Company for years. Love their fresh pasta and great selection of cheeses. Always great service, however today was the exception. Rudest woman at the cheese counter. Then went to get the fresh pasta and the woman behind the counter was downright nasty. She was covering the pasta at 4:00, they close at 4:30 and I asked her if it was to late to get pasta. She rolled her eyes at me and said uh yeah-we are putting it away right now. A simple yes or no would have been nice. I said ok thanks anyway. Then she must have reconsidered and said well did you want something In a very rude voice. Needless to say I walked away. Wow! Pennsylvania Macaroni Company needs to work on customer service. Obviously she hates her job, then get another one! If I didn't drive so far to get there I wouldn't have written this review.
